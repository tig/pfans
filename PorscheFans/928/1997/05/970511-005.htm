<excerpt>I decided to post this in case someone has some insight into
what I am trying to do. I can do 10 updates per second running 38.4k baud
on the rover to the laptop for logging.  The Differential station updates
at 1 Hz over a 4800bps wireless link and is interpolated (forward
predicted by the rover. This latency only means 5 to 10cm of accuracy
loss.

</excerpt>

Statically, perhaps, but 60 mph is almost 30 m/s, so a large fraction of
a second translates to multiple car lengths.


<excerpt>Position Accuracy is 40cm for the short baselines that i have in
mind.  Velocity accuracy is 0.05 mph.

</excerpt>

see above


<excerpt> I log to a laptop and process in Excell or Matlab.

</excerpt>

Have you ever used a genuinely symbolic math program like Maple or
Mathematica? These make it easier to do the job when you have a truly
functional relation, particularly one involving integrals, between raw
data and what you want to learn from them.


<excerpt>I will have to come up with a test run protocol that is similar
to the inertia wheel dyno tests.

</excerpt>

Modeling of this sort is something I find to be facilitated by Maple, and
I do use Matlab when appropriate.


<excerpt>I figure multiple passes (in opposite directions) for each
scenario (chip) to compensate for wind, slope.

</excerpt>

And for variation in driving technique; you are not a robot!


<excerpt>I presume they usually use 4th or 5th gear and start at 1000 rpm
or so and go full throttle until redline.  4th makes sense for a road
test so that I don't have to drive at 160mph and it will also make the
wind resistance a lot less of a factor.

</excerpt>

This surprises me. Aerodynamic drag will be even less of a factor if you
do standing-start (e.g., 0-60 or 1/4 mile) or low speed roll-on (coast
at, say, 20 mph in first, then punch it), and you'll need a lot less road
and a LOT less luck in avoiding law enforcement attention.


<excerpt>The most challenging part will be to find a suitable place to do
the runs in the Phoenix Area.

</excerpt>

see above


<excerpt>I will also weigh the car before the test.

</excerpt>

and, of course, add your own weight.


<excerpt>I will <bold><underline>HAPPILY</underline></bold> publish the
results since no chip manufacturer would give me dyno results for a GT.

</excerpt>

This will win you widespread gratitude.


<excerpt>I presume that this is because the increase in performance on a
GT is negligible for any chip upgrade.

</excerpt>

Au contraire; the "hotter" cams in the GT engine are just what it takes
to get more out of an aggressive reprogramming. Your car should improve
more than mine did with optimal retuning; what is unknown is how close to
optimal the programs in the commercial chips will be for your particular
engine.


Meanwhile, remember that all the replacement chips raise the engine speed
at which limiting begins, so watch your tach.


<excerpt>PS  The K&N filter discussion has got me ready to send my
uninstalled filter back.  The desert area here is notorious for frequent
dust storms and fine grain sand. This stuff is always being kicked up by
the cars ahead of you. I may just hang on to it out of intellectual
curiosity for when I run my chip tests.

</excerpt>

Sounds good. If it doesn't give you a performance benefit, you should
avoid the (perceived; may actually be negative, but no one has hard data)
risk.


Good luck with this ambitious project!
