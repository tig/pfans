Yes definately, we're still talking Porsche remember!
Yes and I did.
It was for more HP than the trans though...

Of course.  But the lack of 1st gear selector position has been correctly
referred to as a design flaw.  Either way you are there to learn about how
to improve your control of the car, not win a trophy so "just do it".  Run
whatcha brung!  

Now, if you're heading toward bracket racing then the automatic is superior
to the manual for consistency's sake, especially when lauching from the
line.

Is this that super-miniature car with funky rear hatch window?  (Japan's
first attempt at Mini Cooper )
