Hey 928 fans,

Just put in my new "Stargate Superion" headlight bulbs today!!  WOW are these
things bright, and very white too!  I have not driven with them yet, I just
sat in the car with them on and switched from hi to low beam and they seem
very good.  No undo load on the alternator that I can tell either.

Stock lights are 45watt low/65 watt high and these are 80 watt low/ 100 watt
high (I think Phil is running even higher power lights than this), so these
are much brighter than normal.

These should fit H5 lights in the '87 and newer 928's (not sure about the
GTS's however).  These replace 9004 headlights and are called the 9004IB.
 The part number is 947+0185.  My cost was $25/bulb vs $13 for the regular
replacements and $30 for some other type of high performance bulb from
Automotion.

Good luck guys,
James Morrison
