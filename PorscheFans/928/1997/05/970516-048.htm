Well whoever said this was too good to be true is correct. If porsche ever 
went to an 8 cylinder engine for the 911 i highly doubt that they would 
consider making it compatible with the 928 engine (actually 100% doubt 
it). For one thing the next generation 911 (next year's model) is NOT 
aircooled, so they will already lose that. It is a watercooled flat-six 
based on the boxster design but larger and with more horsepower.  Porsche 
could no longer keep air cooling and continue to meet more stringent 
emissions standards. So for the next 5 years i would guess, there will not 
be an 8 cylinder engine for the 911 - for a lot of reasons (weight, size, 
fuel economy, etc.), plus most importantly money - it costs a lot of money 
to make a new engine, and porsche is saving a bundle by making the 911 
engine compatible with the boxster's engine. I know people hate to hear 
anybody talk about putting a chevy v-8 in a porsche, but that is the only 
alternative engine that I see in the near future (or future period) for 
the 928. Maybe someday we'll see a flat 8 for the 911 (like the 908 of 
years past?:) that would be cool to see!

This sound too good to be true.  I would be surprise if Porsche abandon
the flat 6 configuration.  It offers a very low center of gravity
that they are accustomed to.  The "true" (Sic) Porsche fan would also
find it hard to swallow that 
1. they are loosing their air cool engined
2. the flat 6 is replace by a V8.

I do hope that I am wrong.  And, lets face it, the 928 GTS engine
is already producing 326 Hp.  Making it 350 or more would be very
easy for the factory.  And the cheap aftermarket part would be so
nice...

Just want to expresss my experience with the radiator.  When I first 
got the 928S, the radiator was slightly dripping and then turned into a 
water fall.  Found that the leak was at the seals; between the aluminum 
core and plastic end.  I took a vise grip plier and SLIGHTLY reapply 
pressure at every aluminum tang point along the radiator's edge, both 
side.  Voila!  No leaks ever since.  This could possibly be a temporary 
fix, but so far so good!
