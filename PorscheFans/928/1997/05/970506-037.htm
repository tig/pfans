I too was very surprised to find my car stay running after I had turned
the ignition switch off (and pulled out the key), this was two days after
I bought the car. Anyway I found out that on my car anyway, if I had
turned the rear defogger switch on with the car running, I had to turn it
off to shut off the car- after the ignition switch was off. I still think
that on my car anyway that this has something to do with the "interesting"
wiring changes done to the car for the Alpine alarm and stereo, so this
may not help you out.
