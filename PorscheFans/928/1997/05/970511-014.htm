When I got my car about 5 years ago I too noticed my oil pressure guage
pegged as soon as I turned key on.(not started) (It was at 4.5~5+ bar
running) I troubleshot it with my manuals and found no definitive answers, so
I tried getting under car and tapping  the sender with a screwdriver handle
and then when I turned key, (not started) it went to 3 bar ---Tapped on
sender more and now it goes to 2 bar. (repeated tapping would not get it
below 2 bar with key switch on)---Anyway, still when I turn key switch on
--it is at 2 bar, and when I start it, pressure goes to 5 bar immediately
(cold) . (Oil pressure warm is 3~4 bar idling and goes to 5 or pegged when
given gas) I know my methodology was not very scientific, and it's not like
the sender is that expensive, but my question is whether or not my guage is
now reading properly (should it be at 0 bar when key is switched on?) or is
my oil pressure still 2 bar exaggerated? I also wondered if the sender could
be disassembled and cleaned /repaired. (how does it work etc.)
                           
 Happy motoring,
