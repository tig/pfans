Jim,

The problem with buying car battery is that you have no ideas
who makes it.  For example, the Eveready battey is not made by
Eveready but they licensed there name on them.  The Die Hard
of a few years back is not made by the same company that makes
them today.  There is only a few battery manufacturer in the world 
so chances are, the expensive battery could be made by the same
manufacturer as the cheap ones... (same goes with small batteries 
BTW).

So, I think that if your charging system is in good condition and
that you keep an eye on the battery, you should be OK.  Also, my
mechanic thought that the AutoZone battery were OK.


Definitly take this one for what it is worth,
