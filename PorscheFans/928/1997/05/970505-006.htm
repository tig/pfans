Help, Help, Help.

I've got major electrical problems with my 86 928 S2 which is driving me to
total MADNESS.

1) The brake warning light comes on although there seems to be no problem
with the rear bulb actuation. Most times this happens after I've used the
head lights, wipers or brakes.
The corruption clears as soon as I use the brakes again. Both Brake lamp
bulbs are of same wattage and all connections seem fine.

2) The cruise control is intermittent and can sometimes work even with the
brake warning light on. Could this be related to the above corruption?

3)The ABS sometimes actuates when its clearly not needed. I've cleaned all
sensors which helped alot but this still happens occasionally.

4)The speedo  does not work sometimes below 30 mph. Could this be related
to "3)" and can any one tell me where the speed sensor can be found?

5)The starting seems to take alot of cranking but if I ensure the fuel
system is charged by bridging the fuel pump relay the car starts instantly.
I've noticed that the fuel pump does not cut in until I've cranked the car
for sometime. Should this be the case?

Can anyone help with these problems or see a pattern that I've missed? I
would welcome any constructive idea's or contact with anyone who has
experience similar problems.
