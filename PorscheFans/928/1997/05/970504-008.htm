        Hi Martin, and other Porsche fans.  Read your message on Porsche
Fans page, and would like to confirm your question about the VIN, yes you
vehicle is the 60th car ever built as far as I can tell, I've just stared
investigating the VIN on my 78, 9288200419.  From what I've heard most as in
about 80% of all the 1978 Porsche 928 built had a 5spd in them.  My car
sounds to be some what similar except that my car has only 65k miles on it
and my car is all stock except for an ANSA racing exhaust system that was
just installed.  As for hopping up your injection system, there is NO
COMPUTER in this animal, it uses "SEMI MECHANICAL" feul injection, it is
electronic feul injection but only in the loosest form.  As for gas the
manual stipulates that you car run regular 89 octane in the car and expect
no difficulties, but have done some experiments and found that running high
grade is infact EASIER on your wallet, due to the gas is more efficient in
that more of the gas is burnable and that means less peddle for the same
power.  As for oils, I'd infact like to hear some comments on that, I've run
synthetics before and have found that in some cases a little engine wear IS
good, in that surfaces don't get glazed causing lifter knock, or I have also
heard that running synthetics or synthetic additives can cause the plastics
in them to stick to parts in your engine causing unwanted affects.  I think
I might be inclined just to run a high grade Quaker state or Penzoil.
Although I've heard guys around my area, Victoria BC Canada, run there cars
for over 300k miles! and only require routine matenence and a feul pump.
One caution I have been heard emphasized a lot is to NOT MISS SERIVCE
POINTS, or even over service the car, because most of the COSTLY repairs
could have been avoided by proper servicing.  As for adding high performace
parts, air filters and zippy spark plugs typically DON"T give the power you
hope to get from your money.  I feel the way to go on the earlier cars is to
get a larger intake manifold, I've heard talk about them, and boost the feul
pressure to the feul distributor.  These are mods the average joe can do, or
you could even look into a slim lime super charger for the car, but they
usually start at $3000 US funds!  I heard stories that one of the men
responsible for the development had a special 928 built for him that
utilized a factory boared 4.7 litre (I believe that is what the 1978 are)
and it had dual turbo chargers mounted to it turining out upwards of 400hp!
When they were desighning the 928 it was taken into consideration, to take
the place of the "old" 911 series, and tobe able to out power it without any
help from a turbo or supercharger.  As for paint I don't really know, my car
was orriginally metalic blue, optional paint, and is now wine coloured.  The
aluminum body parts are showing signs of corosion on the surface of the
aluminum and the paint is getting tired.  Next summer I plan to paint it
midnight black, although if somthing should happen to the car to take it off
the road earlier than I'll do it at that time, right now the paint will
shine up good to look presentable, but is borderline.  So I don't want to
offend the Porsche dignity and name, more like the eccono boxes they made
like the 924 (I might take some flack from some of those Prosche guys for
saying that!).

                        Good Luck with your car!

                                                        Regaurds James.
