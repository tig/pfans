Hi,

I have an '85 928S with 84k on the clock.  I bought it about 3 months ago
and have driven it only about 1,500 miles as family and job pressures
keep my free time to almost nil.  A few weeks ago, I was driving the car
home at about 90mph when the engine shut off as cleanly as if the
ignition had been turned off.  I coasted to a stop and while I had plenty
of battery, I could not get the engine to fire, or even cough.  I brought
the car home on a flatbed and the following weekend I looked at the
engine.  Good spark, good fuses and relay to fuel pump.  On the chance
that the gas gauge (reading 1/4 full) was erring, I added one gallon of
gas and the car started immediately.  Easy repair, I thought.  I took the
car to a gas station one block away and fueled it.  The amount of gas it
took indicated that the fuel gauge had indeed read correctly.  I drove
the car one more block and while sitting at a light, the engine died.  I
got a couple of sputters out of my starting attempts, but then nothing. 
I came back an hour later and tried again, no good.  I came back several
hours later with jumper cables and got an immediate start.  I then drove
home.  I have started it several times since then, but am afraid to go on
the road because I don't know the cause of the failure.  I bought a fuel
filter and hoped to change the original and to find it full of water. 
However, I have not invested in the manuals and I'll be damned if I can
find the fuel filter.  Help me please!

Anyone, have you ever heard of a problem similar to mine?  I am baffled.
