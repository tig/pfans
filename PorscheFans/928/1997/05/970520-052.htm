        Hey all you Porsche fans, today I was at the Porsche dealers and
talking to the parts "GUY" and he told me I should write down my VIN on this
form, $30 canaidian and ship it off to Porsche of North America in Oklahoma,
I think he said it was.  They will send you back a Porsche registraition
form listing all of the options your car has or had, and any other relivent
info.  As well I got a photo copy of this dealer info on production no. of
all porsche's in north america from 1975 to 1984 and it told me that there
were only 1130 cars built in 1978 which means that I might be able to get my
car on collector plates because of it's "limited production" numbers.  I
also read that in the GT models some came with, PSD "Porsche Spechial
Differential" which is like the limited slip differential but controls the
wheels with clutches and is electronically managed much like the new Boxters
LSD.  And also did you know that there were NO 1992 928 ever produced.  Any
cars built in 1992 were built half way threw and designated as 1993 cars.
The blurb on 928's I have also go on to say when Porsche was designing the
928 that they never tested the complete car until 1977 and all of the parts
had been being tested in 911's, Mercedes, Audi's, and Opel's prior to going
into a prototype car.  The enginers also bosted a rear 50/50 weight
distrobution over the car.

        Also I over heard the parts "guy" selling a set of late model 911
turbo alloy wheels with factory tires to some other "guy" to put on his 928
for $4500 can with the exchange of his old tires.  As well he has to send
the car to an auto body shop to have the fenders widend to accept the 18"
wheels off the 911.  The parts "guy" also told me that when ever they
installed some later model wheel to an earlyer 1970's 911 to widen the
fenders they would use a certen wooden base ball bat on the edge of the tire
to the fender and it would put a beutiful curve on it.  They did this for
years he said.


        Just out of my curiosity, does the later 928 electronic fuel
injection throttle bodies fit to the 1978 cars?  I want more breathing to
the engine.
