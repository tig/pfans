Hi Stephan,

Well, if the line comes off the clutch master cylinder it's damned near
impossible to get it back on.  I replaced mine because it was beginning to
fray.  Took me almost an entire day to get the new tube onto the clutch
master cylinder -- very nasty job.  And yes, you need to bleed the clutch
afterward and that was ANOTHER nasty job.

Rebuilding is pretty easy.  The hardest thing is to get the cylinders out of
the brake.  Just use the compressor that comes with the car to inflate the
emergency tire and blow the piston out.  However, follow the factory manual
recommendation that you point the piston at a flat piece of wood when you do
this because that piston comes flying out at a pretty good velocity and
could damage something (or itself) if it's allowed to hit concrete or steel
items.

I don't remember encountering any difficulty at all in putting the piston
back in.  The trick, I think, is to coat the rubber ring with some clean
brake fluid.  Had some trouble getting the calipers back together, but some
ingenious use of a large hose clamp to hold the spring in place while I slid
the pieces together solved that problem.

My time is getting so limited by my employer -- imagine, they actually
expect me to *work* and all that kind of stuff -- that I can't do that in
the immediate future.  

However, the factory manuals have excellent sections on brake rebuilding as
well as how to pull your instrument cluster out and put back in.  The
pictures are worth a thousand words.

Good luck with the FAQ and I'll try to contribute later!
