Stephane:

Check out Polk Audio's dB line of sub's - I had a single 10" in a
low-volume box (just under one cu. ft) strapped to the rear seat back,
firing rearwards or upwards at my discretion.  I ran it bridged mono off
two channels to avoid running a dedicated amp.  In the future I would have
added that sub-amp but you know where the car is now...

Either that or you could run three 8"s in one of Jim's sub-boxes...  The
amp could be mounted directly on top depending upon dimensions.

A 6" isn't a sub  :)  <or hardly a woofer even>
Phil
