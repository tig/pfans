Porsche people generally don't give a hoot for "matching numbers." OTOH, 
Corvette people live, eat, dream, and breath matching numbers as they don't 
have much better to do. Or anything else to differentiate their machines.

If the work is done right, "non-matching" numbers won't hurt the value of a 
Porsche. Newer engine, transmission, brakes, and suspension almost always 
increase the value of a Porsche. Unless you are looking to sell it to a 
Corvette owner...

Re: Consumer Reports: their testing proved all synthetics are essentially 
equal in remanufactured Detroit V6's in taxi cabs in New York under 
continuous duty. Under those conditions they also had a hard time telling 
*any* difference between any motor oils.

What CR wasn't able to quantify was lubrication on a cold start. They had 
to revert to lab tests to determine the 100% synthetic oils performed 
better over wide temperature ranges. Synthetic blends were no better than 
recycled dinosaurs.

Many people claim its a bad thing to introduce synthetic oil to an older 
engine. At least early synthetics caused old seals and gaskets to shrink 
and leak. Not sure if this was due to old material saturated with dino oil 
which didn't mix with the synthetic, or if the old materials were just 
incompatible. I find it hard to believe a modern reputable product such as 
Mobil-1 or Syntec would have this problem today. So chalk it up (at least 
partially) to Modern Urban Folklore.

10W40 is an all-around good weight. Don't run 15W50 in seasons below 32F. 
Don't be tricked into running the common 5W30 or 10W30 during the summer. 
Most manufacturers spec those weights today in order to maintain the best 
EPA fuel economy ratings. They don't care if your engine only lasts 150k 
when it might have gone 250k.

Speaking of non-reputable products:

Teflon in an engine is evil. Even in your Nissan truck. I'm not a chemist 
but from memory the agrument against Teflon in engines is roughly: Teflon 
is a long molecule containing hydrogen, carbon, Florine (as in Floride 
toothpaste) and other things. Under high temerature this molecule breaks 
down. One of the byproducts is HFl, hydrofloric acid. This is one of the 
nastiest acids around. And its eating your cylinder walls.

Then one day somebody off the wall claimed that it was OK for HFl to eat 
the cylinder walls, as that kept it roughed up (as in honed) to better 
maintain a film of oil for lubrication.  :-O

I used to buy Fram oil filters for my non-Porsche until one day I saw a 
Fram filter with a Teflon suppository (or something) that would trickle 
Teflon into your engine. If Fram is going to put Teflon in oil filters then 
their marketing department has totally dominated their engineering, and 
their products can't be trusted anymore. "Be sure to tune in next week 
folks, when Fram invents the SplitFilter(TM)! Breakthru Technology! Fram 
has discovered that by abandoning the traditional cylindrical oil filter 
configuration and replacing it with a Y increases filtering surface by 50% 
resulting in 3% to 5% better fuel economy and increased oil capacity for a 
longer engine life! Testimonials will follow after a word from our 
sponsors..."

Neeless to say, I don't think much good about SplitFire spark plugs either.

While there is no question that a K&N filter has less resistance, there is 
a question about the size of particle it filters. Maybe another case of 
Urban Folklore, but supposedly a large construction company, mining 
company, or somebody who ran a large fleet tried the K&N filters. This 
company also routinely did oil testing when the oil was changed. And all 
vehicles with K&N filters had more fine dirt in the oil than the disposable 
paper filters.

Others claim K&N must be good because racers use it, and so did the Army in 
Desert Storm. But in both cases their priorities are different than mine. 
In general a racer is happy if his engine lasts the race. The Army is going 
to be more concerned about being able to wash and reuse a filter in the 
field that is full of sand, and will be happy not to have to carry spares.

No new chips for any 928 older than 1984 because it doesn't have any.

Only if it make *you* happy.
