>>"...Porsche is expected to offer the 996 later with an all-new 350 HP
V8..."

Don't believe it just because it has been printed!

Porsche stopped front engine car production and replaces the 911 because it
needs to cut cost by sharing as many components as possible among its product
lines. The new 911 is largely based on the Boxster and its new watercooled 6
cylinder Boxer engine. Developing a new, separate V8 engine or just a 911
version with the old 928 V8 would be absolutely crazy for Porsche! There have
been discussions about a flat 8 based on the new Boxster engine, but my
sources say this has been dropped - at least for the foreseeable future.
Instead there is talk of a new Turbo version...

I also hear that the 3 liter Boxster S with 245HP will be delayed until 98
because Porsche has to focus on launching the new 911 this year.
