What is the COMPLETE URL  for the website 9284evr   PLEASE?

JEEZ!. So many posting about auto trans. 1st gear starts. HEY, I wrote about
this in length already, but will be redundant again :-))))

Precision Auto Designs, Renntech, or Beverly Hills Motoring Accesories will
sell you a EXCHANGE or NEW valve body (remember this is a Mercedes-Benz
transmission for your 928 (believe 85' & newer, but check). This will allow
1st gear starts regardless of degree of off-the-line throttle. They cost
about $800-$1295 depending upon which store, and whether you want to buy NEW
unit modified OUTRIGHT or you want to do their "exchange" program. Call "800"
directory assistance for their #'s. Precisionisin Campbell, CA. Bev. Hills
Motoring Acc. is in (DUH) Beverly Hills, CA.

Crashed 928 man! Basically, have a competent body shop that has a CELETTE
system unibody with 928 settings/specifications. Have them check your
unibody, if the cement truck bent the unibody, screw it, let the insurance
company add it to their fleet of bent vehicles. If it's O.K. after checkout,
get a complete bid, ADD 20% for all the hidden shit from the accident they'll
find after opening it up, and compare tothe insurers offer for cash payment.
As far as keeping for parts, yeah, if you are planning on buying a identical
year so as tomake best use of all the parts SOMEDAY. I suggest (humbly) say
GOODBYE to your friend, let the insurance co. cut you a check, cry for a
hour, then get a goodnights sleep. Start fresh the next day on your searchfor
another 928. I suggest a California Car as no rust, no salt, no heavy
industrial fallout, etc. If your next needs paint, keep $25-3500 in your
checkbook. If it's HAD major body work, WALK. If the interior doesn't look
like new, WALK. 928 should NOT be a project, but a enjoyment. Find the BEST
example you can find - have it checked out by a PorscheDealer, and then "pay
the price". It's less expensive in the long run... in $$$ , and in headaches
from getting a ":bargain" crap 928. Keep it a STOCK  928. Many of the mod's
done are of dubious quality (read: first time modders' work) Good luck.
