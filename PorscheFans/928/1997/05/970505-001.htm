Hi Frank,

Right, the plastic clip.It's about 1 1/2 inches long by about 3/8 wide and
is made from some kind of white nylon substance. This snap-fits to the
locking mechanism itself and links, again as a snap-fit, onto a small ball
on the side of the lock barrel itself, so that by turning the lock
mechanism you unlock the mechanism. Because of this the lock-barrel itself
is simplicity itself to remove, and no you don't need to remove the door
trim, just undo the allen bolt (You'll know it when you see it; it's the
one level with the lock itself. Once this is removed the barrel slides out
and you then just lever the plastic link off the barrel with a fine
screwdriver and pull the barrel clear. The only slight complication arises
in trying to snap this clip back on when refitting, but with patience and a
pair of needle nosed pliers it's not too bad. Removal of the hatch  and
ignition locks I am not familiar with, so I am afraid you will need the
advice of one of the other members of this group who has a manual, though I
suspect that the operation will be fairly simple in both cases.

Anyway, I wish you luck and do please let me know if the re-keying works,
as you say this is an area where we could both save a lot of money!

Best regards,

Daron Townson
