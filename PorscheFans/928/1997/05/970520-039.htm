Hi All!

Stephane Chabot asks about his A/C compressor clutch wiring and says:
"The wire going to the a/c clutch was not connected to the wire harness
and grounded to the block... (There goes another PO modification)."

In my 928, the whole air conditioning system looks like an after market add
on. The positive wire to the A/C clutch is not part of the wiring loom but
snakes around the front of the engine and the condenser mounting brackets
are a little home made looking for Porsche. So, this part of your car is
probably normal.

Stephane goes on to say:
"Does this sound right to anyone?  Wouldn't the wire be for positive
supply to the clutch and the ground be provided through the mount??"

Yes indeed. The positive supply to the clutch goes to a pressure switch (?)
on the A/C receiver/dryer at the front of the car and then on to a source of
12 volts. The clutch is earthed through the the body of the compressor and
its mounting. I suggest that you remove the positive wire from ground and
run a short jumper wire from it to the 12 volt battery supply stud thing up
near the radiator. You should see and hear the clutch clicking in and out as
you connect and disconnect the jumper wire.

Later, Bruce Gilman asks about intermittent power seat switches.

Bruce, my 1980 928S had a similar problem. Looking at my 928 Performance
Portfolio book (it's amazing what one can find in this book), you may have
different switches from mine but here goes. There are four philips head
screws that remove the switch panel and from there, the switch rockers can
be levered out to expose the contacts. DON'T LOSE THE SPRINGS OR DETENT
BALLS. Clean the contacts with VERY fine sandpaper and reassemble. This is
an easy job and fixed my intermittent seat problem.

Before I go, I fully agree with Leonard Laub's comments on oil additives. Go
do an Internet search for Ed Hackett's multi page expose of Slick 50 and
their ilk, it is worth it!
