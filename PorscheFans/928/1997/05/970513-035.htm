Derron,

We had a chat about the luggage covers about a month ago right when I started
subscribing to this list and it went something like this.

Every late model 928 (S4 and newer for sure) came with a luggage cover in the
back.  The older of the S4's (or any actually that have been exposed to much
sunlight over the years) have totally rotted and usually also shreaded
covers.  A new cover from Porsche will set you back somewhere in the
neighborhood of $1k...yes that is 1000 smackers.  If you have all the
hardware (plastic and metal pieces you can send it all to 928 International
and they will have one built up for you for about $275.  If you have a family
member who is very good w/ a sewing machine you can get the material and have
them do the labor and get by for <$90.

My mother-in-law is a great seamstress and she did one for me last Christmas,
and you would never know that it was not box stock unless you were real
familiar with what they should look like on both sides and maybe even had one
there to compare it to side by side.

So, anyway, they are not really rare to find, just rare to find them not
destroyed by the sun.  I believe the originals were actually 100% cotton (at
least the closest material I could find to the original was 100% cotton) and
that would explain why the sun is so hard on them.  The material my new one
was made of it a cotton/poly blend so it will last longer...it just does not
have the same texture on the back side and it also does not stretch quite as
much as the original....still looks great though.
