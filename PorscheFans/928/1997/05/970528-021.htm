Howdy, 928 fanatics,

(or is it 928 aficionados, or "connoisseurs of fine automobiles").

Greetings from Canada. Yes, we do drive 928.s up here too, if only for
6 months of the year, but appreciate it that much more because of that.

I have discovered your site only couple of weeks ago and have been scanning
your past notes since then to get a feel for what you are all about.
You appear to be a fine bunch of individuals with a common bond, love of 928.s
I realized immediately that this is MY HOME and decided to register to become
a full-fledged member of your family. 
I hope you'll accept me into your extended family.

I think I do qualify for membership:
- have been a proud owner of an "ever so slightly enhanced" Guards-Red/Black
  Leather 1979-928 Auto with only 68,000 miles on the odometer for 2 years now
  (yes it catches everybody's eye but that's the way I like it - it is 
   beautiful so let it be seen, cops or no cops) 
- every time I get in, fire it up, put it in DRIVE, a smile comes across my
  face - no matter what mood I'm in.  Ohhh, what a feeling !!!
- and that feeling only gets better the faster you drive it 
- I share your enthusiasm for this car and do believe it to be one of the best
  sport coupes ever built, in spite of the many minor "Porsche-quirks" we are
  all challenged by
- I too have a dream, a 32 valve standard, year 87 and up

Now couple of question for you guys:
- do any of you work to make a living, have a job ???
- if the answer is yes, how do you manage your time ?
- between working on your "toys", reading and writing messages to this forum,
  time spent at work, do you have time to do anything else, not to mention
  having time left to drive your pride and joy ?

I find it hard enough to keep up with the daily updates never mind contributing 
on regular basis.
But you keep it up, I am learning a lot of interesting facts about the 928's
Some of you are obviously very knowledgeable on the subject.

Leonard, I do enjoy your contributions in particular, thanks.

"928s forever"
