>>Hi Terry!

Hi Phil,

>>
>>You had a good model too - first of the big HP 32v !
>>

Yep and it was a fluke. I was in the market for a 911 (little did I know)
and a friend told me about this 'Porsh' for sale. Looked it over, started it
up and couldn't believe the sound at idle - it was music. Drove it for about
10 minutes and wondered whether I REALLY wanted an auto. Thats when the PO
said "hop out and I'll drive" . After 30 mins of what this car could do
legally on public roads I was sold. No arguments and no regrets and I've
loved everything about the 928 ever since (and have never looked at a 911
since).

>>My neighbor also had the same.  Alas he has M.S. and was forced to sell the
>>car, after his wife 'abandoned' him.

MS is a terrible, terrible hand to be dealt. I have no direct contact with
it but am aware of how destructive it can be. Sounds like he has a good
friend to draw on though. 

>>  It shows his wife sitting very prettily next to his light blue 928 S.  

To borrow a classic phrase mine also was the 'light blue shark looking thing'. 
Absolutely beautiful colour for the 928 I feel.

>>The focus of the picture is obviously her, with the car just barely
>>visible, on a warm sunny day.  I will treasure that photo also as a gift
>>from a dear friend.
>>

When you get right down to it, photo's are what we all end up in/with.

>>We had talks sometimes down in the garage by my car, he reminiscing and
>>sometimes dreaming of outfitting a 928 with handcontrols but in reality his
>>disease is too far advanced now to make that practical.
>>
>>I will take him for rides when the 'new' car gets here.
>>

I was laid up and feeling sorry for myself a few years back and good friend
'forced' me onto his Kawa GPZ for a 'quiet' ride. He went past my house at
110 mph with me in full leg plaster and grinning from ear to ear. There's
nothing like speed and good friends to make you forget all the problems and
the pain.

>>And one last thing, Thank You all for your friendship, help, enthusiasm,
>>you name it.  I've found corresponding with you all extremely pleasurable
>>and look forward to all the posts daily, sometimes hourly!  I wish to
>>feature each and every one of your (928!) cars on the webpage - maybe even
>>start a registry.  Who knows, we might just have that newsletter/magazine
>>someday (with articles by Kim Crumb, DEVEK, 928 International, Autothority,
>>etc?).  Stephane has a monumental task ahead of him so let's do what we can
>>to help him get the FAQ started.

Nice sentiments. 

>>
>>Whoops there I go again getting wordy.  Sorry for my sometimes long posts
>>as you know I am a nut.  I am really glad this list is around to keep us
>>928 fans in touch instead of maybe seeing each other on some anniversary
>>production date or race.

All the best to you Phil.

I can understand a parrot mistaking a wall mirror for a whole other room but
you'd think he'd at least try to avoid the head-on collision with the other
bird...
