To Sam Herrin,
                No you dont have to take the transmission or the driveshaft
 out to change the clutch as there is a splined coupling just behind the clutch
that you can slide back and then you can remove the clutch centering
shaft/primary driveshaft.       I would advise anyone attempting to replace
a 928 clutch to have a look at the workshop manual (porsche) as you must
insert three homemade metal pieces in order to keep the presure plate
depressed throughout the process, (if anyone needs a rundown of the entire
procedure I will gladly go through it) For the rest it's a straight forward
process especially if you have a hoist or a pit ( I did it on my back on the
floor but the clutch assembly is HEAVVVYYY!!) all in all its easier than a
"normal" RWD car. By the way Sam What happened to your other 4 HP my 87 S4
has 320!!

To Lucas Hartong,
                Have you tried calling "van Zweeden" in Domburg? they
probably have secondhand gearboxes for sale.(if you want a quick fix) but I
dont know what they would cost.

To Phil Tong,
                The 928S II or to please all the people all the time 928
SII/928S2/928 S2 Was not a UK only car it was a ROW car what I guess most of
you guys would call a "Euro" and it had/has 310 HP.

By the way people S2 sounds better S4 goes better!!!!!!!!! any comments?

Kevin
