That sounds like the euro version. (I had hoped mine was but its not)
Depending on the body you are describing and  mileage it could be worth
$4k. What do you have in your jag? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------
The Jag has a 262HP V12 with loads of smog equipment (4 catalytic
converters
...etc.)  The engine has really been crippled by that & the 3 speed
slushbox...but
in spite of all that, it would still blow away the 928 I drove...I suspect
something
wa svery wrong with it...I've noticed the thread about 1st gear mods.  The
only 
aftermarket transmission upgrade for the Jag is some $5k + 6-speed manual
conversion by a company in Ohio.  Y'all don't have it so bad!!!!!
