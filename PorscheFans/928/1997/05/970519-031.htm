John,

Just guessing again but if the air temperature measurement was
low enough, then the AC does not need to start and save some
power...  The reverse is that you would want the AC to be on
more often if you know that the air coming in is warmer.

(Feedforward control can be great but I am not sure if the climate
system is that sofisticated...)
