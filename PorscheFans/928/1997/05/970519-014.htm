Too all....
Paul, I get around 15 mpg. around town, 21-23 on hwy. 928S4 Auto. Sorry, I
don't go to racetracks with my car, but I love to watch others haul a_s :-)

Matt, radiator question. The 928 radiators (as long as the cooling system is
kept properly serviced) are quite durable. The only area where they can be
suspect to leakage (typically 80-100+K miles) is the seal between the
radiator core itself and the tank end, which is plastic. All you need to do
is remove your radiator (if you have ascertained IT is the leak area) and UPS
it to Jim's Radiator in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He will clean, replace with new
seal, tank end & crimping. Good work. About $150. I have had 2 different
Mercedes radiators "rebuilt" this way. Makes like a new radiator. His # is
800-306-9249. Suggest before removing you run some COOLING SYSTEM TRACER DYE
, available at NAPA stores (order item) through the cooling system first. Use
a blacklight bulb. All the leaks will show up a "lime green oozing". A slight
amount will always show from areas like radiator cap, what you're looking for
is tankends of radiator, hose connections, draincock on block, etc. Hope this
helps.

Steve Smith/timing belt retensioning question: No, not every 2K after
replacement, ONCE at 2-2.5K after initial installation. The belt is very
long, and will have initial stretch. This is why it is important to drive the
full rec'mnd. miles BEFORE retensioning, so that the belt has done all the
stretching it''s going to do. About $100-125 at Porsche Dealer. They have the
factory tool to EXACTLY set the tension. Hope this clarifies and helps. :-)

Everybody, If you have trouble finding Meguiars Medallion Leather Care I
talked about in earlier posting, call Meguiars at 1-800-347-5700 for a store
near you that carries it. It's your Porsches leathers best friend. I use on
all my cars for years.
