here is an idea that might work and could be done tastfully.  Have you
looked on some 
american "Chromed" car that they put these metal "stick" that stick out
and will make
a noise if they rub on something?  Well, done like this, it looks pretty
tacky but
it does the job.  What if you find a way to install those thing in a
manner
where they are not so noticeable??  I am actually thinking of adding
them on my car
after I buy a new front spoiler on my 85.  If they stick about 2 or 3
inches in front of 
the spoiler, you should be able to hear a noise before you do damage.

The only other option is to install a redar linked to the brakes.  If
you get
closer than 1 feet to a big object, WHACK, the brakes engages at full
power and
the pour restorant attendant gets a nose bleed from hitting the steering
wheel!!
(It would be easier to prove that the attendant goofed off by the
bandages on his/
her face and the blood stain on your steering wheel ;-)
