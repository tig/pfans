Sounds like you have a leak around the water tank.  Did anyone fill
the coolant lately (overfilled that is)?  You might want to check
the condition of the water tank and the hose leading to it.

The water pump being in from of the engine, you should see water up
front or at least on both side...

Is your radiator cap snug and in good condition??

This was less than $0.02 worth...
