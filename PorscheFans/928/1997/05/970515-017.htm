 Thanks for the info. The spoiler sounds like mine - but I cant look at
the car until after the weekend. Im heading up to vegas in my dads Audi
5000 Turbo to navigate in the Silver State race on the 318. The only
thing I cant qualify that you said is the part about the  'two long wind
deflectors' - I dont remember anything being 3/4 the way up on the
hatch. but il'll check it out. It looks very well made so it really
wouldnt bother me if it was 3rd party, it has a nice cutout for the base
of the wiper etc and it fits nicely. I just didnt understand why so many
people mentioned that  78's have the distinct 'unspoil(ered)' look.
