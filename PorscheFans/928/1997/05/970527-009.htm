I saw the car listed below for sale here in Tucson, AZ yesterday.  I took a
look, called the seller & here's the poop.  He offered me a finder's fee but
I turned him down.

Late 1986 Porsche 928S five speed (built 10/85).  White, chocolate brown
interior.  81k miles.  ABS, sunroof, rear-A/C (I think), tinted side & rear
windows, Blaupunkt in-dash cassette (Monterey?) & standard 928 speakers.
Paint appears to be very good but not perfect.  No dents or dings I could
see.  No external evidence of repaint.  Front & rear spoilers in good
unbroken condition.  Two minor dash cracks in original vinyl dash, otherwide
interior appears to be in superb condition.  Original rims look nice &
round, no curb dings.  225/50-16 Michelin MXX3 (?) tires all round -- fronts
look half worn, rears just have a few 'thou left in them.

Dealer (Tucson Leasing Corp. -- ask for Vito -- at 520-327-9777)  has it on
consignment from what appears to be the second owner... a customer of theirs
"who has had some lifestyle changes...".   Car apparently spent 85-to-91 in
Thousand Oaks & Rancho Palos Verde, CA (LA) before coming to Tucson.
Service records (Vito did me a quick look-see over the phone) had no
immediately apparent evidence of crash repairs and what Vito thought was an
impressive pile of regular service records.

Some notes on the 1986 model year: 5 liter, 32v, 288hp, if it has the ABS
then it should have the larger 4-piston "S4" style brakes.  From '85 on the
five-speeds had the vastly improved Borg-Warner synchros.

Asking price = $12,500.  If a good 928 mechanic gave this a healthy review
then I think this would be a very nice deal.  Damn... it looks better than
mine, I paid $13,500 in January '97, and I had to go all the way to Virginia
to get it!

I'd be willing to check this out for a member of the list, but I'd have to
have you make a small ($25-$50 contribution to your local symphony, chamber
music society or classical public radio station) charge for the service!
