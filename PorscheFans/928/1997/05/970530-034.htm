There may be a remote oil filter kit for a different car which might be
adapted to the 928.  But I don't know any cross-application similiar to the
928 filter in width / thread / etc. for the adapter plate. Bet someone here
could fabricate one though hint hint.  

Re: draining the oil
Same goes for a remote oil drain lever.  This one might be easier to find? 
FWIW I'm using one of those 'permanent' drain plugs - just flip a lever on
the plug and oil pours out through the bolt.  As long as no miscreant
crawls under my car and finds it, I'm ok with it (protected by Smith and
Wesson for you lurkers).

Also, there are electric pumps on the market now that you stick down the
dipstick tube to pump out the old oil.  True, you still have to get under
to remove the filter but then you don't have to undo the drain plug,
replace the washer each time (you are doing that right?) or deal with a
sloshing catch pan.

(Sort-of) aside note:
Anyone saw their old filter in half to see what's in there?  I took a look
down the official Porsche filter and spied a relief spring in there!  So
I'm going to attribute it to a  bypass of some sort... another caveat
against buying cheaper, maybe not up to spec replacement parts you know?

Phil
