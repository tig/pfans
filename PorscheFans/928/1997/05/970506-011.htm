I can't disagree that 6" is pretty small for a sub.  However, I like my
sound
equipment to blend in with the interior.  So If I can make the most out
of the factory location, that's what I'll do.  

My thinking behind the 6" (sub)woffer was to give me something better
than the
4" that is in the car.  Those are definetly not woffers.  With the right
crossover,
(electronic??) sending only low frequency to the 6", I thought it would
sound OK.

Perfect sound is not expected, I still want to remember that gorgeous V8
under 
the hood...
