Hello Porschefans,

Thanks for all the responses you left me but I went ahead and called 928
International (they know what they're talking about when it comes to a
928).  No offense toward anybody on the list.  Jim told me that my car
was running on 4 pistons. I could not beleive this.  He told me to start
pulling plug wires one by one to test it.  Sure enough he was right.  I
was running on 4 pistons.  The problem was a plug exciter or something
like that which is located in front of the radiator on the drivers side.
Jim and the rest of the people at 928 International are knowledgable of
the 928 and can help on almost any problem.  Since yesterday was my
first real driving of the 928S4, I consider it to be top of the line in
sport and luxurious cars.  Just my opinion......

Thanks for all the help Porschefans,
Sam Herrin
87 928S4 (out of shop and ready to go)
