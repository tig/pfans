> "The Pony Express is for novice and experienced racers alike.  There are
> speed classes and safety requirements that you can easily meet without
> any problem or prior experience.  Although it will be a walk in the
> park, you could start out in the touring class, where the highest
> average is 110 mph (I think?).  All that is required is a helmet and a
> vehicle in excellent condition (i.e., no leaks, good condition OEM
> belts, properly rated good condition tires, etc.).  I think they might
> even give an exemption to 928s (as they do to Corvettes) for a roll bar
> up in some of the higher classes, but you would definitely have to have
> five-point harnesses to go higher than 110 average speed.
> 
> They hold a practice session on Friday for those who have never competed
> before (and anyone who wants to "shake-down" their car).  That gives you
> a feel for what you and your beast are capable of doing on race day. 
> You can pick your speed class *after* the practice session, so that you
> are sure that you will be comfortable with the speeds you will be
> reaching during the race.
> 
> Give them a call if you are interested...their phone number is
> 619-440-6043, ask for Sherri Ward and tell them we sent you!!!  We would
> *love* to see you there...it's not just the race event, it's a whole
> weekend of car-loving fun.  Nice people, good weather and cheap motel
> rooms...what could be better than that? :)

> **** If you want to post the above to the 928 list, maybe there are
> others out there interested in going!! ***
