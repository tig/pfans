I need some brief assistance with a distinction between the wiring colors of
the '89 and '91 S4.  I have a technical specs chart from a friend in the
stereo business that lists the colors for a '91, and I need to know if the
colors of certain wire changed from '89 to '91.  I know the fuse locations
did, but cannot tell from the micro fiche if the colors did.  

The ones I need help with are:

Starter:			Yellow
Ignition:			Black
Tach:				Brown/Black
Power lock:		Brown/Red 	(negative polarity)
Power unlock:		Brown/Green	(negative polarity)
Parking lights:		Green/Red and Green/Black
Door Pin Switch:	Brown/White
L.F. Window Up/Dn:	Green/Red and Green
R.F. Window Up/Dn: Gray/Brown and Gray/Black
Trunk Pin Switch:	Brown/White
Hood Pin Switch:	Brown/Green
Trunk Release:		Yellow (positive polarity, at release switch


If anyone has the hard copy of the wiring diagrams and can confirm these
listings, or let me know of any changes, I would GREATLY appreciate it.  I am
taking the car on a long road trip which includes Toronto, Boston, and NYC,
so.... I am concerned with theft and want to get the alarm wired in before
hand.

Thanks so much,

Brian Robinson
