Zekkus,

Just wanted to let you know that I was at a drivers ed event this weekend in
my auto 928 (there was one other auto 928 there too, '87S4) and we definately
hold our own.  I was eating some of the 911's for lunch...of course there
were some M3's and even a lowly Miata that gave me some serious grief (the
miata in the twisty stuff, the [must have been highly modified] M3 even gave
me grief on the high banks).  What you will find when you do this is it is
way more driver ability than it is car.

We all think we are pretty good drivers...just wait till you get out on the
track!!  Talk about humbling experience!!  Like Phil said just run what you
brung, and believe me the 928 has enough power to really eat people up on the
straights.

Incidentally the other 928 had some tranny work done and I am going to get
the specifics on it because it allows him to really hold on the first gear
almost all the way to red line and then to hold all other gears there, and he
gets quick snappier down shifts...sounds like just what I need!!
