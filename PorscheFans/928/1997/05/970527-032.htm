The D in the serial number is the key to the year.  I think I am wrong
but
I think your car is an 83 (D-oh!!).  Because my 85 is F, E is 84, D 83??
You might need to store the car a few month before bringing it into the
country...

You are not kidding!! Canadian custom = Gestapo...  I came to work in
the
state a few years back and now, when I go back to visit MY OWN COUNTRY,
they
ask me where I am going, and what is my reason for coming to Canada. 
Quite
insulting...  Also, they always ask me where I bought my car...

The month and year of manufacture is located on the driver's door sill
(at least on
my 85...)
