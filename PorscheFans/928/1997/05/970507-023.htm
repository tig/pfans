  I've replaced my front wheel bearings before and thought I'd pass
  on this interesting instruction from the factory service manuals:
  The aluminum hub that contains the bearings has to be heated to a
  precise temperature before pressing out the bearing races.
  The temperature isn't very high and I can tell you, there's 
  nothing like the aroma of wheel bearing grease being cooked 
  in your kitchen oven!
  
  Sorry Stephane, I don't remember much about the wheel bearing
  grease I used, other than it was an off-the-shelf Penzoil product
  that seems to have worked fine for 10K miles.
