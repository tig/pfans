Your Porsche dealer has the $600 German precision tool for cam belt
adjusting. This is generally done after 1K miles on earlier 928's, and
factory rec',mnded at about 2K miles on 1987-forward 928S4's. The tool they
use is very precision, and the person who posted regarding this tool is very
accurate. The dealer charges about $100 or so to do the belt re-tension, it's
guaranteed, and you know its done right. People who  have independents "do
it" to try to save a buck, if the independent does not have the $600 tool
(Its in the Automotion catalog) my suggestion is to stay strictyl with the
dealer. There are many people who go 3-4k miles before adjusting. If your a
RPM maniac, do it at between 2K-2.5K to be on the safe side. Hope this helps,
guys & gals!
