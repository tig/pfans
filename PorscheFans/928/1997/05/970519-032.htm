Have you guys ever thought about how this affects other motorists? Did you
know that older peole need longer to readjust their eyes after being blinded?
That glasses or contact lenses might cause reflections and increase the
blinding to some? Have you ever noticed how much more you get blinded by cars
running their foglights in the rain? It's probably even worse with those
"power lights"...

People who are blinded by "hyper-illumination" might drive without vision for
up to two seconds, that can be a long way depending on speed!

An additional comment on foglight use: They only illuminate a very short area
in front of the car. If used in fog without the driving lights this minimizes
"self blinding". In clear nights adding foglights to the driving lights gives
a fake impression of better overall light. In reality, this combination
decreases long range vision because the human eye adjusts to the area of
intensive light in front of the car. Objects further away can be better seen
with the driving lights only.

Sorry, I'm not against having fun, but I have no understanding for
selfishness on the road. If you need "power lights" or Christmas Tree-like
illumination, please consider limiting it to the high beams!

Drive safely!
