Hello again, Porscheians,

From sunny Holland some questions about my 1983 S:

1. As with other owners, I also have problems with the dash. Normally 
when you get in your car, the lights in the doors and in the roof would 
ignite. They don't. My clock is not running on time (lovely sometimes!) 
and only shows its numbers when the car is running. 
I think it has something to do with the connections of the radio, as I 
have two wires left unconnected! I don't know how to connect them. The 
radio works fine, including the automatic antenna, which raises when I 
start the radio. Whta is this? Fuse problem?

2. The second (and sometimes the first) gear 'creaks'. The first two or 
three times I put the car in second gear it makes a noise, like grinding 
teeth. What is this?? Synchronising??

3. How many 928S were made in 1983? I know my car is 7th made in that 
year.

Thanks a lot,
great driving!!

Lucas Hartong,

1983 S 'banana yellow'.
