This car is not in my vocabulary.  Is that an older Lotus??

To keepm the discussion going, I will throw in a curve...

In my case, I have been driving 1. Honda CRX Si then now an Acura
Integra RS.
Well, as inexpensive "sporty" cars, they both served me well.  Actually,
I 
cannot find much flaws with the integra (and the service manual is
written
for dummies and it is CHEAP!!!) UNTIL I bought the 85 928 S.

I understand your frustration driving the beast.  I wish that I could
open it
up and see what it can realy do (not know because the brake do not work
right...).
I join PCA for the driver's ed and racing but I will be surprise if the
car is
ready for the track in 97 :-(

Anyway, my problem is that the Acura now feels powerless.  I will not
make a comment
about my wife civic at this point either ;-)

My drive to work are now boring and when I pass, I must pay close
attention because
I do not have the powerful V8 I am getting accustomed to (also some
confusion with
going back and forth between the two 5 speeds, just close call so
far...)

My problem is that I work in an industrial complex and I do not want the
928 to 
be in that environment...  But everyday, I crave that power and it is
getting
more and more frustating.  Maybe I will buy a 944 S (do they need a
space Phil?)
and using as my junker to go to work...

Still undecided,

Stephane Chabot
85 Porsche 928 S (14.7 lb/Hp)
92 Acura Integra RS (25.6 lb/Hp)
91 Honda Civic SE
