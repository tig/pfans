....hmmm.. can you think of a microcontroller that support ADA? or is 
there a cross-compiler available?  This is really conceivable!!  And 
what about TEMPEST-harden the body and electronics?  And since I'm 
giving it a new paint job, why not make it stealthy?  I mean, I can 
just walk across the building and get a few gallon of stealth-paint 
additive that we use on the B2s... Wow. Imagine that!  Being able to 
drive thru a radar trap at 140 mph and having the radar gun register 
zero!
