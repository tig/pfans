What you have IS a 928 S...  technically speaking it is an S3.  The '85
heralded in the 32 valve DOHC 5.0 liter V8 for the US 928's.  We of course
were thrilled at the engine advancement and 288hp.  The ROW kinda' stuck
their noses up as Euro engine produced 300hp - BUT - with a 16v engine.

No matter, you have a good one...  I hope to have my website going soon,
with alot of info for you.  Until then there are many excellent sites to
surf...
