I have a picture of the last 928 for sale in the US on this site. It also has
many pictures of 928's, some of the owners belong to Porschefans too. If you
have a picture of yours or any other intersting pictures, give me an email
and I'll put them up.  

Also, with my coolent problem, I was driving to class and the radiator hose
broke0
 and I had no coolent.  It must have lost all the coolent at night but I
didn't notice it because it rained the night before, so I drove(not far) and
the car started to smoke up. I pulled over to the side right after a toll and
a Trooper saw and called a tow for me.  It was only a broken hose and not the
radiator, so I was lucky for now.
