Good advice, Leonard. Sorry to hear about the crash. 

I had a 914 a few years ago. I was waiting for oncoming traffic so I
could turn into my driveway, when I was rear ended by a cement
truck. He didn't actually rear end me--he ran over the right rear
quarter panel, making it conform to the tire. He didn't roll, I didn't
get hurt amazingly enough. 

The (pleasant?) surprise was his insurance company. I had done a bunch
of research into a fair market value for the car, and had a figure
that I was prepared to live with ($4k). They offered me
4.2k. Sometimes you actually do get reasonable compensation. Of
course, they were probably hoping I wouldn't say "ohmyneck" or
something.

Blue book is only one way of valuing a car. Especially with special
interest cars, it can be significantly wrong. The way to fight a low
value estimate is to document prices. Buy magazines with prices,
gather info wherever you can (printed is probably much more convincing
than web). 

Be sure to get a copy of Bruce Anderson's article in December 1996
Excellence. He details the current prices for 928 cars year by year.
1983 928's range from 7k to 11k (poor/good/excelent) in his article.
