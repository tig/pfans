I have an 85 Euro 928 S 5-speed (310 hp), and yes, it's fast. And it has
better gear ratios than the US cars. I blow away my buddy who has an
automatic S4. The only problem is that the previous owner had it imported
brand new from Germany, but did a real crappy emission conversion. The cat
was the wrong size, low flow, exhaust terrible, etc. But if you find a good
example, it's a really great car.
