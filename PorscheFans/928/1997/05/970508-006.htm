Howdy y'all, unlurking.

At the moment I'm still 928-challenged, but I'm looking (current ride is
a 91 Festiva L, heh).  Soon I'll graduate and enter the alleged "real"
world, with the associated job and income, so I'd better quick find a
way to keep myself in debt or I'm going to have money I won't know what
to do with...

I'm looking at/for a 80-82 928.  There are enough things I've
heard they changed for '80 that I don't think I want anything earlier
(engine tweaks, elimination of vacuum doorlock system, other weirdness).
I don't really have anything against the S and S4 apart from styling
(Why'd they have to get rid of the phone dials and add the spoiler?
Aerodynamics schmaerodynamics...) and pricing.  Of course, if anyone
has reasons I should go for an earlier/later car, I'd be glad to listen.
I will be living in the Northern VA/Metro DC area soon (buh-bye Idaho!),
so if anyone's got a line on a good car...

Anyway, so much for an introduction.  Now for the meager posting that
was the intended purpose:

I probably would recommend against this.  Not knowing the construction
of the sensor, I'd wonder if it contained soft rubbers or plastics
which, while oil-friendly, would be eaten alive by that other kind of
dead dinosaur juice...
