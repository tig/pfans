Tried to send this a while back, but my mail was messed up.  If you have
seen this before, my appologies.

An acquaintance who works in the same office building has decided to
sell his 928. This car has been his daily driver for many years until
recently he bought another 928. He doesn't have internet access so I
volunteered to post an advertisement for him:

1979 928 5-spd for sale. No sunroof, US/Calif car with 250,000+ miles.
Runs well, well maintained mechanically.  All origional but shows its
age and would need paint and interior work to be really nice. Car can be
seen in Lafayette, CA. $3,000.

This car will never make it to concours, but is a good driver.  It has
no rust, no dents and doesn't smoke and seems to run well.  Interior is
well worn, but clean.  Interior has the usual sun dammage, seats and
carpet are well worn, blue metallic paint is origional but worn pretty
thin. Missing rear hatch lock cylinder. I considered buying this myself,
it might make an interesting autocross car - just strip out the interior
and put in a lightweight racing seat, roll bar and harness.  I've seen
worse cars for $5,000.
