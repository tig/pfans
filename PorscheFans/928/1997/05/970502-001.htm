Hello:

My '84 shifts to first early also.  The trans had a recent fluid and filter
change so I expect the level was up to snuff but may not have been? 
Subsequent shifts go to full redline.  One would think the fix should be
fairly easy given the number of MB trans cars out there.

FWIW someone posted a source for reworked valve bodies that make the MB
trans start out in first rather than second gear under normal driving
conditions.  Whether or not it's reworked to hold first to redline is
another story but it would be pretty silly for them not to have done so...

The other alternative is to have your own valve body modified by an
independent MB trans shop, thus saving much more bucks possibly.

Will repost msg. if I can find it,
Phil Tong
