You don't have stock 6.5" next to the rear seats already?  Yes definately
need to pass only mid-range to this size speaker, especially if you're
running any kind of power - they'll fail shortly if not (and you will be
blasting your new setup I guarantee it!)  The 4's etc. in the doors shoul=
d
be hi-pass only but you know that already...

There are these new mini center channel speakers that could fit in the
console vent but wiring them might be a pain?  Neat though...
