I've been saving my pennies toward a used 911. For some reason, I
looked at some 928 ads. I'm surprised to find that 928's have similar
or even cheaper prices. Now I'm tempted, but I have some questions.

I plan on doing most of my own work on the car, and I will be looking
with an upper limit of $10-12k purchase price.

1. Are the 928's as reliable as 911sc's? Especially with regards to
major repairs like engine rebuild.

2. Can anyone offer me a copy of the December 96 (?) Excelence article
by Bruce Anderson about 928's?

3. There is tons of info on 911's, some of which I have read. Is there
any info (books, faq, ..) on 928's? I'm mainly interested in the
technical side here.

Thanks,

I'm curious, did you also change the shift lever to spring load in 
neutral?

I too dislike the long travel of the shift lever.  I simply shorten 
mine by about 2.5 inches and that reduces the length of travel also.
Not as elaborate and complete as your kit, but I'm satisfied with the 
result.
