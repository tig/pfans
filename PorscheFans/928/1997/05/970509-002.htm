It's interesting that you mention this.  I've just inherited a Ford 
Ranger pickup about a month ago and found that the fuel gauge is 
inoperative.  After removing the gas tank, playing with the sending 
unit and taking resistance measurement along its travel length, I found 
that the resistance reading is pretty much linear.  Rightfully so 
because the gas tank is almost rectangular in shape.  Now, comparing 
this to our 928 which is more cylinderical and possibly some extrusion 
here and there, the fuel gauge will have to take this into 
consideration if it is to represent the fuel level accurately.  So it 
is reasonable to suspect that the sending unit on a 928 is calibrated 
and designed to take the fuel tank's shape into consideration.  If this 
being the case, then performing "calibration" on the fuel gauge itself 
would be useless.
