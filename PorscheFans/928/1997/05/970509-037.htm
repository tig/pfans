Ed,

	This is very good advice.  What i did when I ordered my part
was to make a list, put the part number of each of them, indicate
the model year, and its details (ie auto or 5 sp and others) then
FAX the part request to all the number I could find.  I made sure that
I asked for them to fax the prices back.  And wait a couple of days
and compare price.  The best places got the orders...

Just try to make it easy on them by putting the part from the same 
category together (ie brake parts separate from water pump and hoses)
and put it in tabular form so they just have to put the price on and 
fax it back to you.

Do not forget to say where you saw the add in case they include a
discount.  Same goes for PCA membership.

My $0.02 worth.
