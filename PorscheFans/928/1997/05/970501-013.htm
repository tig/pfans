PFans with Automatics,

Tell me where your shift points are and if you are stock or modified....

My 88S4 with AutoThority chips, K&N, and Muffler shits to 2nd at about 4400
or so, and then 3rd and 4th come up at about 5600...

I have already heard from a few folks on the list and all but one says they
see about the same thing as me...the one is getting much better performance
and is getting full red line shifts from every gear including first...

TIA,
James Morrison

As much as I hate to take the credit.. Its me!  But if it happens 
again... then it must be someone else!  :-)

Have you consider taking the tumbler to your local locksmith and have 
them take a look at it?  Sounds like just a broken spring that put 
pressure against the pin(s).

Congradulation!  By the way, feed your 928 a bottle of Techron ($3.97 
from Wal-mart; $1.00 rebate) with your 93-octane and watch your baby 
scream!

Use some contact cleaner while you're at it.  That's almost a guarantee 
that it'll be making good electrical contact.

Check your rear light bulbs to make sure they are "balance".
