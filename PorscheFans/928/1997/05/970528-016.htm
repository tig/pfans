Hi people,
        A few people have recently been writing about removing the
air pump in order to gain performance and I'd like to add my bit if I may!
I think there are a couple of things one should consider here.
1) What is the effect on the engine.
2) What will the performance gain be
3) Is there a trade off between 1 and 2.

1) The air pump pumps air via a long bore which runs the length of the
cylinder head into the exhaust ports where the unburnt fuel is ignited. If
air flow through this bore is stopped there will be a build up of carbon and
various
exhaust products in the air injection holes and in the bore itself. This can
happen if the filter gets completely blocked too. This means that if you
want to reconnect the air pump after running without it for a year there is
a chance it will be no good in any case and you'll fail your emmissions check!

2) The performance to be gained will be small and will not be anything like
as big as removing the airco system or throwing out various bits of excess
baggage like 200W stereo system or electric seats.

3) For the sake of a half a MPH is it worth risking damaging your engine.
   If the thing was'nt necessary they probably would'nt put it there in the
first place!

--------------
P.S.
 I read somewhere latley that in '88 model S4's some of them have the same
engine as the GT denoted by the letters SP after the engine No.

I prefer leaving the air pump alone and add an electric fan in place of 
the mechanical one instead.  (For those 928s that has a mechanical fan 
of course...)
