Then you wrote

OK- I have installed 17x7.5f and 17x9 rear Speedline C2 Turbo rims with
Dunlop D40-M2 (235/45f and 255/40r) tires.  Not sure of the offset, but the
rims bolted directly on to the car.  Think there's room to lower it?  The car
also has the newest Momo wheel (can't remember the name- 3-spoke black w/red
inserts along bottom Club 3 (?)), K & N air filter, EuroProducts custom made
straight pipe, and AutoThority computer chips.  It runs great and the exhaust
sound is greatly improved too.  The main reason that I wanted cross-drilled
rotors is b/c my car is an automatic and the rotors tend to get glazed after
hard use (I'm not saying big rotors wouldn't look cool too though).  I
figured that a little more airflow/cooling via cross-drilling or larger
brakes might help this.
How difficult is it to reproportion the front/rear brake bias?  What types of
mods have you done to you 928?  Any pics to send me of your car?  Thanks for
all the info.
