Higher power bulbs such as 80/100 have very little or no adverse affect =
on
other motorists if the bulbs are installed in headlamps with the proper
cutoff pattern.  I have them in all my cars and nobody ever flashes their
high beams at me.  The lights may be bright (that's the purpose after
all), but as long as they aren't actually shining in your eyes I don't =
see
it as a problem.

If older people (whatever that means... 70, 80?) can't stand the light...
then maybe they shouldn't be driving at night anyway.
