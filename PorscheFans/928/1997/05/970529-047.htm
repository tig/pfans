Euro HP:

- The 928 was introduced in Europe in 1978 with a 240 HP (DIN) engine that
guzzled so much regular gas that customers could not drive from Frankfurt to
Munich without filling up. The engine then was modified to take less supreme
gasoline.

- In 1980, the 928S was introduced in Europe with 4.7 Liters and 300 HP. The
"S" included 16" wheels, front and rear spoilers, air ducts for brake
cooling, and the body side moldings. The regular 928 was still available.

- In 1981 Porsche improved the timing belt tensioners and head gaskets,
without changing engine power.

- Engine power was increased to 310 HP in 1984. That year, ABS and 4-speed
auto were available for the first time in Europe.

- In 1995 a 928 with catalytic converter became available for the first time
in Europe: It was a 5 Liter with 288 HP, designed for regular unleaded fuel.
It differed slightly from the US version.

- From 1987 on - starting with the S4 - engines were the same for both sides
of the Atlantic...

MPG:

Even though mine is an automatic, I agree with Leonard and Brian: I get an
average of about 16 MPG, only boring freeway driving with 80 mph constant
gets me up to 22...
