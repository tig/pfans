Hi folks.
These are the numbers under the rear carpet of my 88 S4, just as they =
are printed.  If anyone can decipher or point me to a source of =
knowledge, it would be greatly appreciated. =20
128-1823 USS
WPOJBO 92xJ8860934
M2841-813-62813
L700-PB
C03 158 418 481 494
570 650

I understand the serial number sequence, and I think that the M2841 is =
the engine designation. The rest is beyond me.  Any help would =
wonderful!  I am quite interested in whether the car was equipped with =
the sport dampers and springs.  It rides quite a bit stiffer than a =
friends 87.

<Just put in my new "Stargate Superion" headlight bulbs today!!  WOW are =
these things bright, and very white too!  I have not driven with them =
yet, I just sat in the car with them on and switched from hi to low beam =
and they seem very good.  No undo load on the alternator that I can tell =
either.
Stock lights are 45watt low/65 watt high and these are 80 watt low/ 100 =
watt high (I think Phil is running even higher power lights than this), =
so these are much brighter than normal.>
Does anyone know the source for these?  I would like to upgrade mine as =
well to a more powerful output.
Thanks in advance,

88 S4  45k miles 19 mpg Autothority (sic) chipset otherwise as supplied =
from factory. (I think that's all, I am 3rd owner.)
89 300TE
73 FJ-55 (w/Smblock chevy, t400, 4 wheel disc brakes, etc.  It is =
certainly a strange beast, but it will go virtually anywhere!!!!!!! If =
you don't mind 9mpg and extreme discomfort.
And now for some shameless self promotion of my associate's..=20

that we just finished the chassis design work on.  It's not a 928, but =
it is amusing and did pull 1.23g on road tires.
