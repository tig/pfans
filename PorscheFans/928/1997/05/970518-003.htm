Yessiree, what I read in the postings is right, that little black canister
that holds the paper filter for the airpump is VERY integral with the way
your 928 runs. Don't know why, but on my earlier (past) 928 it ran completely
different. Now I know to change this little $6 bugger in my present 928. It
varies in location by year, but it's easy to find on a 87- forward model, Its
centered at the radiator, in it's own little compartment, and the lid pops
open, and just drop a new one in!. I suggest every 10K miles if you are in a
 dusty area (I'm not). Also, reccommend BMW's "Intensive Washer Fluid" (about
$12/bottle) for the "hyper-kill washer fluid" resivoir tank upnear the
drivers side corner of engine compartment (near the windshield). This fluid
works great and has a water based lubricant that doesn't calcify in Porsches
vinyl lines and fittings for this system. Try it, you'll like it.

Also, the absolute BEST leather treatment (not to clean, but to protect) is
Meguiars leather care. Comes in a black plastic bottle (not cheap, about $9)
but leaves no greasy residue, no fake "shine", just soaks in. I use it on my
MBenz and BMW, the leather thanks me for it. Keep it soft and supple guys &
gals, and DON'T USE saddle soap, or any harsh cleaners. The only cleaner to
use is Lexol's (comes in yellow quart size at your local saddlery or boot
store). Use it with a soft brush & water (Don't soak leather!!), then follow
 with a clean damp rag to get up residual, then follow with a dry cotton
towel. I do NOT suggest Lexol leather care.To greasy (lheavy based lanolin),
it makes some leathers darken their shade of color, stains stitching dark,
etc. Get the Meguiars! It's a little trouble to find, but any place  that
carries the full line of Meguiars can order it for you. I buy by the 6 bottle
case, and get a little discount. Happy motoring! :-) "Just another tip from
your uncle Charlie"
