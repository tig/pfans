Martin,

I think your best bet on those silly little arms is going to be going to a 
junk yard or to the dealer, both of which would just a soon sell you the 
entire mechanism.  You might try Devek; they've gotten some pretty interesting 
parts for me.  Just give them enough time to gather the stuff for you.  Also, 
it helps to have the book that lays out each Porsche part number so you can 
tell them what you need ($9.95 from the dealer).

With regards to the checked cloth for your seats... Don't do it man!  It 
doesn't look that great and it's really not worth it.  Last time I checked (no 
pun intended) Devek could get you the cloth for about $500!!! direct from 
Germany.  You'd then have to take your seats to an upholstery shop to be done. 
 Oh, and don't forget the door panels too.  They have that same weird checked 
cloth which would have to be replaced.  

I recommend having a good upholstery shop redo your car's interior.  Take out 
the pieces you want done and drive them over (saves you lots of money).  Pick 
out a high quality vinyl or leather (if you want to spend the bucks) and let 
them replace/recover each worn out piece.  They can even make you new carpets 
if you bring in the old ones for them to use as a template.  Then *you* can 
choose the type of carpet you want in your car.  

Good Luck!
