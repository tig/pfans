        Hi there Paul, I know that in the situation of high preformance feul
injection systems, particularaly ones that dump more feul than can be used
efficienly, tend to smoke.  It's generally not black or blue smoke but
rather a grey colour.  From my experience cars with too much injection for
the motor, or have really hot injection systems you can see when they lay
into the pedal that there is grey smoke that comes from the exhaust.  This
smoke is unburnt fuel, but in a car's engine it turns out that you reach a
point when the ammount of fuel you put in doesn't give the projected horses
it should, this is the efficiency fall off.  It kind of looks like an
acceleration graph.  Steep to start the graph, but near the top end the
acceleration drops off, the same goes for the ammount of fuel your injection
puts in.  As long as the smoke isn't black or blue in colour you have
nothing to worry about.
