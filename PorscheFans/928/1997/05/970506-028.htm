This is a good group. While I'm not yet credentialed to belong, I have my
eye on a 1990 928 S4 which I want to purchase, if it's condition checks out. 

From pictures sent to me by its owner, I spotted a black angled antenna
protruding from the rear rooftop. If it's like my Porsche 944, it probably
easily unscrews or pushes in, for drive-through automatic car-wash service
purposes. Or does it? 

Can anyone confirm this?

Can't really comment on the antenna.  I was told that it is or similar 
to the Fubuta roof antenna and that you unscrew it off the mount.  It 
also has a built-in amplifier within the mount.  I'm curious... why 
would that be a concern?  Especially when I would NEVER put a 928 thru 
a car wash machine.

If you're ever slightly interested in the 928 let alone owning one, you 
have the credential to belong!  Welcome!  :-)
