Hi gang and hello to Kurt (This one's for you!!)

I've just been in contact with my local Porsche dealer to ask about a =
child seat for your 928. Yes they can get them (Part nos. 000 802 021 00, =
000 802 031 00 and 000 802 041 000 for reference). Apparently they are =
available in either dark grey with a subtle "Porsche" logo print or with =
black sides and a grey/ blue/ yellow/ pink fleck inner (Yes, apparently it =
looks about as bad as it sounds. Prices? Well the three-piece kit comes in =
at Sterling=A3 140.18 (You don't have to pay tax) though apparently =
shipping will be IRO =A360 (Though that depends on how quickly you want it!=
) This price equates to about US$ 225, so I don't know how this compares wi=
th what you'd pay over there. =

Anyway, they are more than happy to take a 'phone or fax. order and charge =
it to your credit card if you should desire to go ahead. The dealers are:

Lancaster Colchester,
'Phone +44 1206 855500

Good luck and let me know if I can help with anything else.

Regards,
Daron Townson
1981 928S Auto

ps. =
Phil!
Did those .jpegs of my car ever make it through to you or did they once =
more get lost in the aether? Any more word on the GT yet?
