And euro-spec engines too...

"It's not just a job, it's an adventure"

PC scheduling, 2-way radios & pagers, lack of sleep!

Unless something major is going on, the 928 doesn't need much work!

contributing

Give it time, soon you won't be able to do without it!  

> But you keep it up, I am learning a lot of interesting facts about the
928's
> Some of you are obviously very knowledgeable on the subject.
