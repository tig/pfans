<<I was wondering what the difference between Autothority and superchips?
Which

one is better. There is a big price difference, 850 to 395. Thanks.

Matt-
Not to insult anyone who has a Superchip chip installed in their car, but
they are junk as far as I'm concerned.  I have never heard anyone say
anything good about them.  There is a difference in the price for a reason.
 AutoThority chips have a lot of research and development behind them, plus
they come with a great factory warranty and performance guarantee.  I
installed the AutoThority chips in my 87 928S4 and have been extremely
pleased.  Improves the performance and driveability of the car immensely.
 Worth the money.  Incidentally, you can get the exact same chip from
EuroProducts for around $200 less than from AutoThority directly.  Give them
a call: 1-800-962-0911 & talk to Mark Baldwin.  Later...
