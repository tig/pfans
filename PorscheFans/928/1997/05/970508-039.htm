Synthetic Oils
Once upon a career I worked for Royal Dutch Shell - they put out a Great
Synthetic called XMO which was "First Fill" for all Porsches.
Suffice to say - if you can pay the weight - synthetics are the way to
go - rather than load the oil with additives, the oil is run through
catalysts to create the desired effects - part of the reason it is so
expensive vs regular oil.
On a finely machined/close tolerance engine such as Porsche, Synthetics
offer greater lubrication, longer service life (although running past
5Kmiles is silly as the oil filter clogs up and starts bypassing due to
pressure valve, through a less restrictive medium (at least it used to
be that way with filters) better friction reduction and no loss of
properties through heat or mechanical stresses found in engine.
Just my 2cents worth -
