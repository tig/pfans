With all this talk of how BAD the 928 is on gas I thought I should mention 
something here. When I moved from Toronto, Canada to Key Largo, FL I drove my 
'84 928S Euro all the way. I know some of you (maybe alot of you) will say how 
could you do that!? Call me strange, but when I buy a car, any car, I buy it 
to drive it, not just to have a big model. With that said, I got all the the 
way here for $108.67 in gas (and I didn't use the cheap stuff, I can't with my 
car). I found this incredible, the secret was I was with someone who was 
driving a Motorhome so speeds never exceeded 65mph. So basically 65mph in 5th 
gear is barely revving, less than 2000rpms. Soooo, if you do alot of highway 
driving and fight the urge to mash the gas (I know it's hard) the 928 is 
actually very good on gas. On the other hand though, if you do alot of stop 
and go, she's a PIG! It's not a fair comparison but the Motorhome used over 
$350 in diesel.

BTW the car was a pleasure to drive over this long distance, the seats never 
got uncomfortable, about the only thing uncomfortable was driving 65 ;)
