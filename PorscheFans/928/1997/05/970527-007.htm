The headlight adjusters were, I believe, deleted from all U.S. spec 928's
(just look for the little hole on the box to the left of your driver's
seat.)  These were required by several European countries -- certainly
France, what others I'm not certain -- solely for the purpose of leveling
lights when cars were heavily loaded.  Anyone who's ever ridden in a French
car, from Citroen's Traction Avant to 2CV to current, from Peugeot to
Renault to Simca, etc., will note the extremely soft springing that is a
result of adapting to that country's very rough "B" roads and the
non-city-folks' use of anything with wheels as a heavy beast of burden.
Like our own U.S. lighting laws, a tradeoff designed to punish the
intelligent by protecting the discourteous and insensitive from their own
ignorance.

Given the 928's firm springing and limited load space, there is really no
real value in this feature even if your have it.  It does NOT replace the
need for accurate light adjustment nor the need to use the lights with
consideration for fellow road users.
