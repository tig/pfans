 Hi 928ers,

Matt and Stephane complained about their rear locking mechanism
this is obviously a common trouble spot because in both 928's I've 
owned I had the same problem.
I tried the procedure Stephane has outlined but I found that the
motor was already at its lowest position so I ended up adjusting the
"male component" (what about that for a tech term Stephane?) on the lid
by slackening the two bolts and moving it about half a millimeter at a time 
until the thing worked again, I've had no problems with it since.
Only problem is I cant remember if it was forward or backward I moved it!!

Trial and error boys!
