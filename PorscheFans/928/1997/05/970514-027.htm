Although this post? received today via a different newsgroup, has
posolutely, absotively, nothing to do with you 928 fans, I thought you might
get a chuckle out of it as I did:
>
>FYI..This is circulating through Nortel North America.
>The situation has been confirmed.  You may want to
>pass it along to your traveling personnel.
> 
>Dear Friends,
> 
>I wish to warn you about a new crime ring that
>is targeting business travelers. This ring is well
>organized, well funded,  has very skilled personnel,
>and is currently in most major cities and recently
>very active in New Orleans. The crime begins when a
>business traveler goes to a lounge for a drink at the
>end of the work day.  A person in the bar walks up as
>they sit alone and offers to buy them a drink. The
>last thing the traveler remembers is sipping that
>drink, until they wake up in a hotel room bath tub,
>their body submerged to their neck in ice.
> 
>There is a note taped to the wall instructing them not
>to move and to call 911.  A phone is on a small table
>next to the bathtub for them to call.  The business
>traveler calls 911 who have become quite familiar
>with this crime. The business traveler is instructed
>by the 911 operator to very slowly and carefully reach
>behind them and feel if there is a tube protruding
>from their lower back. The business traveler finds the
>tube and answers, "Yes."  The 911 operator tells them
>to remain still, having already sent paramedics to
>help.  The operator knows that both of the business
>traveler's kidneys have been harvested. This is not a
>scam or out of a science fiction novel, it is real. It
>is documented and confirmable.  If you travel or
>someone close to you travels, please be careful.

> Yes, this does happen.  My sister-in-law works
>with a lady that this happened to her son's neighbor
>who lives in Houston.  The only "good" thing to this
>whole story is the fact that the people doing this
>horrible crime are very in tune to what complications
>can happen afterwards because of the details
>precautions they take the time to set up before
>leaving the room.
>The word from my sister-in-law is that the
>hospital in Las Vegas prior to transferring him back
>to Houston stated that these people know exactly what
>
>they are doing. The incision, etc. was exact
>and clean.  They use sterile equipment etc. and the
>hospital stated that other than the fact
>that the victim looses a kidney there has not been any
>reports of other complications due to non-sterile,
>etc. tactics that were used.

> Please be careful.

> Sadly, this is very true.  My husband is a
> Houston Firefighter/EMT and they have received
>alerts
> regarding this crime ring.  It is to be taken
> very seriously.  The daughter of a friend of a fellow
> firefighter had this happen to her.
> Skilled doctor's are performing these crimes!
> (which, btw, have been highly noted in the Las Vegas
> area)

> Additionally, the military has received alerts
