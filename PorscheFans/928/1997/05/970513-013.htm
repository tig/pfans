All,

I just repaired this problem on my late '86 S.  There is indeed a powered
amp for the windshield antenna.  It is located at the right base of the
windshield (i.e., located above and to the right of the glove box).
Without a working amp, you will have a very disfunctional radio (only the
most powerful FM stations can be received).

The amp is accessible by removing the glove box assembly.  This is actually
not too hard to remove and replace; I had no re-alignment problems...  (and
not too many left over nuts and bolts).  You will have to remove/replace
two slip on air duct hoses, if you decide to remove the glove box assembly.
The booster amp is a small black plastic box with three black wires going
into it:
        Coax antenna wire (about 1/4 inch diam)
        Lead to windshield antenna (removable plug goes into the antenna
power amp; about 18 gauge wire)
        12 volt power lead from vicinity of radio console (thin 22-24 gauge
wire)

The antenna amp device is a black plastic box (about 3" x 2" x 1/2 "
thick), with four philips head screws located at each of the corners.  It
is bolted to the car chassis with a 13mm bolt and washer.  It is located
about 2 inches above and to the right of the removed glove box assy.

First approach- just remove the radio and look for the disconnected or
never connected wire.  After removing the radio, you can proabably find the
power wire for the antenna amp in the area of the removed radio.  If so,
you don't even need to find/trace the wire as it enters the antenna amp.
If the booster amp power wire is disconnected from the radio on your car
but is still findable in the radio console area,  then just try applying 12
volts DC to it.  On my car, this instantly cured massive reception
problems.

Use a 1 amp fuse in your test wire, in case you are connecting 12 volts to
an incorrect wire.  Better idea:  use a digital voltmeter to check the
resistance/impedance to ground of the suspected 22-24 gauge black wire.  It
should be something more than 10-20 ohms I didn't measure the input
resistance on mine, since I had already taken the glove box assy out and
was certain that I had the right wire.

I used an electric antenna control wire coming out of my Sony CD receiver
(CDX-C490 or 460) to power the antenna booster amp (+12 volts when the
radio was turned on).  You just need a source of 12 volt power when the
radio or ignition is on.

Second approach- locate the amp and try splicing the small power wire (I
just pierced the wire with a safety pin/alligator clip rig).  Perhaps your
amp is bad if you apply power to the correct wire and reception does not
improve.  Also try removing/reinserting the plug lead that goes from the
windshield antenna to the antenna booster amp.    If this fails to improve
things, the lead between the booster amp and the windshield may be broken.
Seek professional help on this one.  ARGGH!

Two different installation guys at two different Circuit City stores swore
that the problem was simply due to the windshield antenna mount - "they all
work like that".  No doubt, since they had failed to hook up the antenna
booster amp wire in the first place.  So much for professional installers.
I am back to 100% self installation.

Hope this helps you and other from the car installation mafia.  BTW, my
Sony FM radio sensitivity beats the pants off any other Alpine, Pioneer,
Kenwood, or Clarion that I have owned.  Too bad it is out of production.

Steve
