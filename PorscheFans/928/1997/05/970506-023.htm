I'm not really talking a great deal more power, just a little more if any,
and the wiring has handled more already in my '85.  It would be more
efficient to have larger wiring, but that is not the goal.  Simplicity, and
drop in replacement are the goals I am thinking of right now.

>2. put an amp or 2 under the seats

There isn't any room under my seats with all the electric motors.  The stock
location is good, if something can be manufactured that would fit in that
space and provide a little more power.  Also a little better separation, and
clarity.  The blaupunkt sound has always turned me off, a little muddy, not
much tone control, and poor power output.

That's what I am talking about exactly.  Upgrade the speakers, use the stock
locations, and stock wiring and crossovers.

Do you mean in the wheel well speaker locations?  I think the speaker
locations are best left for mid bass, and the rear cargo area is best suited
to an add-on subwoofer box.

There are not any subwoofers that are 6 inch.  They get close to the
frequency response of a true subwoofer, but not quite.  They are simply too
small in diameter to reproduce the lowest bass notes.  By coupling them
together in various congfigurations, some companies have been able to get
them pretty low.  By putting them in the wheel well, you wont be able to tie
them together in the same space, or with the same wiring, to get increased
response.

Do you mean the rear cargo area?  I have a 10" sub, in a sealed box, that
takes up about 12" of depth, and 6" of height,  in the cargo area.  I have
enough room next to it for the CD changer.  I also have plent of room at the
back of the trunk for suitcases, or gorceries.  It works well, and fits
better.  The company is SpeakerWorks, and they are now out of business.  Too
bad, but I am sure someone else makes a similar setup.
