When the NOS hooks up it would be AWESOME - the problem is getting all that
power to the ground.  The 928 is undertired to begin with and I think the
widest rims made to fit are still only 10"s.  You'd spin at full-throttle
in any gear probably up to 100+mph (how many of us remember catching rubber
at highway speeds!)

The plumbing is what would really set your S4 apart from any other.  Go
first-class on fittings and design or leave it alone.

How much
> power to add?  

Good question - I don't know what the HP design limits are for the stock
engine.  

What's being done on stock and drag prep'd engines:
50 - 80HP 	4 bangers
75 - 100 	Rotary's & 6's (except Buick turbo V6 - use V8 jets below)
150 - 250 - ?+ 	V8's 

>Will it destroy the engine?  

Executed improperly - yes.  Immediately.  

However, if you jet conservatively, avoid detonation like the plaque and
remember not to blow it all in one mega-hi-speed-run-till-the-bottle's-dry
moment of insanity the Porsche V8 should take at least a 100HP boost quite
nicely on the stock pistons and rods for short blasts (quite enough to
'kill' your opponent unless it's a ringer also).  Not that I've been there
so YMMV!!!   

Again, the key is going to be overall system design.  

Stock FI system up to snuff currently?  Compression/leak-down tight and to
spec?  Current oil consumption? (as a condition indicator). Ignition system
ok?  Cooling system up to snuff?  No driveline problems?  Brakes good?

I would say at the minimum you'd need a dual injector "wet-manifold"
direct-port, multi-port fogger setup (one for each bank of cylinders if not
eight individuals which is the ideal) ,  auxilliary fuel pump(s) & pressure
reg, single 10lb. NOS bottle (double that later) , and free-flow exhaust. 
Nice to haves would be bigger stock injectors & press. reg, nitrous bottle
warmer & pressure gauge(s).  Don't forget to retard your timing or you will
be sorry.  I don't know if any of the current retard devices can be
backfitted to the dual distributor / knock sensor setup but ifso then add
to the minimum requirements list. 

If anyone has it or knows
> about it any information would be greatly appreaciated.    

NOS is called 'throttle-in-a-bottle" but just remember that's when most
engines blow - on-throttle. Now add additional NOS & fuel mixture to the
picture and you get the picture.  But I repeat, used judiciously NOS is
safe.  Even one of the big auto mfr.s is planning on making it an option on
new cars - was it Jaguar or Infinity or something.

If I've whetted your appetite and you're still up to facing all the
install/design challenges, then it's time to start studying as I've never
heard of a NOS-boosted S4 yet.  The crowd will go wild though and people
will be falling all over themselves at first to help you do it, then to
check it out!

You really need to speak with Nitrious Oxide Systems in California, free
tech line  714-821-0592 (but do remember they aren't going to know much
about the S4 engine).  They are great.  They will discuss your application
and more than likely will refer you to a dealer in your area - or - refer
you to a major distributor/authorized reseller with installation experience
to help design your system (as you can tell I've been down this road
already but not for the 928) (yet?).

Just let us catch up to you once in a while :)
Phil
