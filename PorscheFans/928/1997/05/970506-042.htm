It's interesting to see that there are other people out there with 928s
with questions and comments about these cars.  I'm looking forward to
future email!

Funny that you should mention Automated car washes.  I am the general
manager for a full service wash.  I have a 84 Euro 928 and the owner has
a 88 944 turbo.  Now, I admit that my 928 is probably the most
cosmetically challenged Porsche in the area, and I have been known to
run it through the wash, but a well and properly maintained (sp?) car
wash shouldn't damage a well waxed car.  The owner's car is pristine
(only 32k miles) and it suffers no damage to the clear coat.  This is
due  in part to the excellent paint (and clear coat) on Porsches and
that I make every attempt to keep the equipment clean.  
 
But in short, I advise driving past the automated car wash, unless you
also have a comestically challenged Porsche and it's in desperate need
of a buffing and wax.


On another note, I have a rather large stereo system to put in my car
(as soon as I solve the speaker thing and the "Where the #$?@ to put all
the electronics?!" thing.  I'm considering a false floor with quick
disconnects so I can remove it during autocrosses and time trials.) 
I've been adding to it for years.  Three amps, electronic crossover, and
Alpine CD player.  The sub woofer I have now (and used in my last car)
is a Pioneer Spare Tire Subwoofer, model # TS-WX50 (available from
Crutchfield catalogs for approx. $150).  It fits perfectly into the
spare tire, and it adds just enough bass to complete a  well balanced
system.  It won't blow the hatch off, even with the max wattage (150
watts peak, 60 nominal) but it adds the bass that is missing from even a
good stock system.
