John, Sounds like something is still connected or you are caught on
someting... (Hey, I can realy master the obvious can't I???)

Anyway, If I were you, I would pull the center section  of the inner
pannel (the one next to the door handle). It is fairly easy to remove.
You need to remove the plastic part behind the door handle (1 philips
screw) then you need to unsnap 2 plastic holder located at 12 o'clock
and 10 o'clock.  The pannel then slides up as and can then be removed.

If you are lucky, the plastic sheeting is already removed and you will
be able to see what is in the way.

If you are not lucky, you can make a small cut in the plastic and put
some duct tape on the cut before reclosing the thing up.

If you are more of a purist, you will need to keep on going and
finish removing the door panel...  At this point, give us a 
note if you need additional information.
