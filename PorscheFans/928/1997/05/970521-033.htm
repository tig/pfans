Though it sounds (and probably looks) pretty whacked I hope the owner's
intent was increased visibility and not just the novelty factor.  To each
his own I say - if Porsche can make a chartreuse and lime GTS, then 'we'
should be able to let our imagination run free (amok?) also...   

ie.  If I ever win the Lotto I will find that last GTS and:
1.  pull motor and send to DEVEK for stroker mod
2.  enlist their engineering dept. for supercharger install
3.  send body to Anziano's (?) for gullwing door conversion
4.  paint match and install huge Thor-type Strosek wing
5.  RSC-T1 wide body kit like Fat Albert
6.  give Jim a bag of cash and set him loose in stereo install shop
7.  etc. etc.

I couldn't have said it better  :)     

This also describes the feeling lessor sportscar owners get when a 928
appears in their rearview mirror!

Depends on the state.  Here in California we go through a smog check every
two years.  When I used to live in Hawai'i all cars went through an annual
safety check and had to display the sticker - it  was easy to get pulled
over for anything ie. wheels, exhaust so HPD could check your tags.
