  I've read that same case study by the person who worked for the mining company.
  You can't argue with the amount of effort that went into the study or the
  objectivity of the author.  FWIW, the author found that Amsoil oiled foam filters 
  outperformed both paper and K&N in both filtering capability AND airflow.  
  Supposedly Amsoil only offers their filters for a very limited range of 928 
  applications (approx '88 - '90), but I haven't verified that with their tech 
  department yet.
  
  I'll surf a little to see if I can find the study on-line.  I think it was 
  originally posted on a BMW motorcycle newsgroup.
