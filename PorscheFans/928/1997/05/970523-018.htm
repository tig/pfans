>>Hi Porsche Fans, I'm a new owner of a used  928 and have a few =
>>questions. How do you arm and disarm the alarm? I unlock the door, turn =
>>the ignition and the alarm system shuts down the system. I open the door =
>>and the horn sounds. I turn each door lock. I repeat this procedure =
>>several times turning all three locks in random order until I can start =
>>the car.
>>
The alarm is supposed to arm whenever you lock either door or, depending
on the year, the tailgate, using the long key (almost one and one-half
inches from shoulder to tip.) Disarm when you do the reverse with that
key. There is in theory a shorter key, which doesn't affect the state
of the alarm. The switch which does the arming and disarming is
tacked on to the back of the lock cylinder, and unfortunately is
not very durable and not obtainable except with a new lock cylinder.
On my car, the passenger side and tailgate work reliably, the driver
side unreliably. An individual door switch can be disabled by finding
the 3-wire cable from the door into the cabin, and unplugging the 
connector in that cable.

>>I was checking out how far back the electric seats would recline. When =
>>bringing the set back forward, it suddenly stopped. Now the seat back =
>>wont move in either direction. Did I blow a fuse, the switch, the seat =
>>motor? Help!
>>
If none of the seat motors work, check fuse 14 (the fuse panel is
under the passenger's feet).
