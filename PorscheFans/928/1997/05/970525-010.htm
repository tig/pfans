I spent the whole day yesterday removing all of the worn out upholstery
in my 78'. I am looking forward to hearing the answer to that question
about where to get the art deco checkered upholstery. The part of the
day I didnt spend taking off door panels / interior panels etc. I spent
figuring out my door lock mechanism.  The little white arms (1/2") that
go from my door lock tumblers to the latching system are broken on BOTH
sides of the car! Is there a metal replacement for that part or
something? They seem like ridiculously cheap little items and I hate to
buy replacements that are just going to break again.. Does this happen
alot?
Also - what is the instrument to the right of the clock in the center
console? Mines missing.
Lastly - has anyone had good luck with a pre-cut carpet kit for their
928? I have found two on the 'net, one for $299 and one for $360 - I am
still checking to see if they include carpet for all the little bits and
pieces like the first aid kit and the fuse panel cover. The problem is,
the sample that i got for the $299 carpet set was REALLY cheap carpet -
and the 'next level up' is $659!!! Thats insane!
