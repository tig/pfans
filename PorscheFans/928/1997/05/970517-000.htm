   Well it actually shouldn't be all that painful, provided you don't
drop the old clutch/pressure plate assembly on yourself while taking it
out.:-) The trans DOES NOT have to come out, actually actually clutch
repalcement on '87+ cars may be the most straightforward of any current
production car.  All you have to do is:

-  unbolt and remove starter motor. On my GT i had to LOOSEN not REMOVE 
   the swaybar clamps to drop the starter out of the way.

- drop exhaust pipes enough  to allow access to the clutch housing 
   cover.  Don't forget O^2 sensor is attached to cat converter so 
   you either remove it, or watch how much you drop exhaust pipes(this 
   was my approach).  You'll have to figure out a way to support exhaust 
   sytem.  I used some boxes under the cat.

-  unbolt clutch housing cover

   Now you have access to the clutch assembly.  If you want further
details let me know.

     Good luck,
