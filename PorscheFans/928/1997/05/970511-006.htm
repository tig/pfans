Calling all 928 porschefans-

Here's some info on the upcoming Pony Express 100, June 9th I believe 

Let's go RACING!!!

"The Pony Express is for novice and experienced racers alike.  There are
speed classes and safety requirements that you can easily meet without
any problem or prior experience.  Although it will be a walk in the
park, you could start out in the touring class, where the highest
average is 110 mph (I think?).  All that is required is a helmet and a
vehicle in excellent condition (i.e., no leaks, good condition OEM
belts, properly rated good condition tires, etc.).  I think they might
even give an exemption to 928s (as they do to Corvettes) for a roll bar
up in some of the higher classes, but you would definitely have to have
five-point harnesses to go higher than 110 average speed.

(PT note: not all 5-pointers require race buckets so yes you can run some
harnesses with stock 928 seats depending upon speed class of course!)

They hold a practice session on Friday for those who have never competed
before (and anyone who wants to "shake-down" their car).  That gives you
a feel for what you and your beast are capable of doing on race day. 
You can pick your speed class *after* the practice session, so that you
are sure that you will be comfortable with the speeds you will be
reaching during the race.

(PT note:  Heard you can get DQ'd by flagrantly going over your speed class
during the actual race, so for those wanting to tip-top-end their car, the
practice would be the time and place?  I recall at least an eight mile
stretch from their '96  video...that works out to approx three minutes at
170mph!  Serious indeed and I'm sure at that class you'd need a
rollbar/race seats/driver credentials, etc.)

Give them a call if you are interested...their phone number is
619-440-6043, ask for Sherri Ward and tell them we sent you!!!  We would
*love* to see you there...it's not just the race event, it's a whole
weekend of car-loving fun.  Nice people, good weather and cheap motel
rooms...what could be better than that? :)

**** If you want to post the above to the 928 list, maybe there are
others out there interested in going!! ***
