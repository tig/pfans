Not clear to me why it should ever go to infinity, unless you push
the clutch in - are you sure the manual didn't want you to do that?

It's interesting to note that pushing on the brake with the cruise
control on disengages it until you reset it, while pushing on the
clutch disengages it only until you release the clutch pedal. In
other words, you can shift with the cruise control on, and it will
stay on. The manual says that, but I never made the connection
until I started troubleshooting mine.

Mine had symptoms pretty similar to yours. Cleaning the switch
contacts seems to have fixed it. Just remove the cover under
the steering wheel - three bolts, plus you have to remove the
black plastic cover for the rheostats if it's there - spread
some newspaper underneath it, and spray contact cleaner on the
contacts while wiggling the switch through it's various positions.
(that's whilst wiggling for you Brits out there). Give it
several good shots and wiggles, let it air out thoroughly, and
give it a try. Even though the contacts checked out, it's
possible that your ohmmeter and the control unit don't see 
quite the same thing. 

Good luck with this; contact cleaner is a lot cheaper than
control units.
