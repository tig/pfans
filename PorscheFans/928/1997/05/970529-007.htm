Pulling a 928 motor is fun. No...really. Without a manual, it's like a puzzle.
The _only_ piece which I destroyed was the lower fuel line. I don't know *why*
Porsche decided to put the 2 lines so close together by the valve cover, but
I just couldn't get my wrenches on the bottom one...so I cut the rubber section
just behind the fitting.

I've never worked on a manual tranny. Well, not on a car, that is. I've rebuilt
KTM, Husquvarna, Yamaha and Suzuki clutches, so I've seen the multi-disc set-
up in another, similar form. Anyway, after removing the bell housing bottom
cover, it was easy to figure out what was happening in there. The only trick
in there was that the allen head bolts on the spline sleve/collar must be
completely removed before the collar can be pushed back (seperating the torque
tube from the clutch) [Special thanks to Marc Reviel for that tip!]

I wonder if I can get those engine dampers to hook back up to the bowtie block?

The engine going in:

350 4 bolt main .030 over
400 crank w/ 5.7 rods
Aluminum 153 flywheel
Forged pistons and Moly rings
Trick Flow Twisted Wedge heads
