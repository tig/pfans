(Stephane Chabot asked):  ...How much does R-12 cost around your place??  My
system is empty and I was told that R-12 is up to $30 per lb.  I just hope I
do not have a leak...

Sorry, SC, my tech's charged $130 for the complete A/C system check &
recharge, so I don't have a breakout on the "R-12"(?) cost.  The invoice did
note (if I remember correctly) 42.3oz... but I can't even say if this is
"freon" or "R-12."  Today we'll officially top 100 degrees for the first
time this year, so the recharge is just in time!  (I'll take Tucson's 95
over a midwestern 80 any day!!!).

By the Bye... what's the deal with the rear A/C?  Does it have a separate
compressor?  Since the rear A/C has it's own separate fan & temp controls,
is there any kind of linkage at all between the standard front system and
the rear?  Is it possible to use the rear A/C without engaging the front
system?  This all goes under the "nice to know, but..." category, since I
can now watch my fingers turn blue inder the blazing AZ sun...
