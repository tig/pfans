Guys, I want to apologize for this long passionate post.

Robert, Robert, Robert, I don't seem to have any of these problems with my
928S. I have seen Camaro Z28s become airbourne at speeds of 110 mph (not
enough weight). Heck, if the 928 was any lighter you'd have to get a
pilot's license to drive it.

One day I saw an accident between a 928 and a late model Ford, the 928 was
so solid that it cut the Ford into two pieces (928 driver walked away
unscathed).

I like the feel of the weight and solidness of my 928. When I get in and
close the door I feel secure when I here that familiar and solid  "thud",
of the door closing, I love to settle down in the cockpit and hear the
thrust of my 32v-V8 as I turn the key (Roars like a lion, speeds like a
cheetah).


This weekend I was driving from Las Vegas to Los Angeles (Picking up my son
from UNLV), and I pulled in to get gas. There sat a Viper as he turn on the
ignition you could bearly hear his engine whine from the drowning noise of
my 32V. He gave me a frightening look, fearing it was a Devek 6.0 400 hp
(not yet). I smiled, filled my tank, turned the key and VVVVVVVROOOOM, the
empowering sound of my V8 jetted me along my way. I caught up with the
Viper a few miles down the road, he was surprised to see me. I mouthed to
him over the sound of my V-8, "one day we'll meet again" and I rolled off
my exit.

Always when I arrive at a drive-thru (McDonalds) and the attendant has the
ask me to shut the car off so that they can hear my order. When I arrive
home from work the front door is already open (my wife can hear me coming
from down the block).

On day in traffic court a Burbank police officier admitted to the judge
that he recognized that I was speeding from the patented porsche 928 sound
(took him a while to catch me).

As a kid I lived near a Naval Base, and I love the sound of jets breaking
the sound barrier (sonic-boom), I don't travel that fast in my porsche but
it is nice to know that it can come close enough.

Robert I waited almost 15 year to buy my 928. I regret settling for
substitutes. I had Alpha's, Fiat's, 66 Mustangs, 66 Plymouth Barracuda, in
my quest for the ultimate car everything else came up short, until I saw
and heard the 928 (Tom Cruise-Risky Business). From that moment I lusted
for it, then that glorius day came and I was the proud owner of one. I had
no Idea that it packed a V-8 until I stepped on the gas and I felt the car
pickup and the gas pedal kick back wanting me to push it even more.

You would have to drag me away kicking and screaming before I would sell my
928. I realize there is nothing in the world like getting exactly what you
want (1986 928S Black on Black). It is my first Porsche and I find myself
lusting for another 928. To own another would be total Nirvana...)

Robert, I rest my case!
