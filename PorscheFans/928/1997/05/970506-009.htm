A big project for sure.  Have you considered:
* EQ & tape in glovebox, amp on passenger tray (driver tray too shallow for
your equipment?)
* or get rid of clock & ashtray and mount eq or tape there
*  custom double-DIN mount (at proper angle too to eliminate glare in the
928 console)

* close proximity of LF spkr and straight shot of RR speaker will give you
imaging fits
*  close proximity of RF spkr and straight shot of LR speaker will give
passenger imaging fits

*  rears should be low-freq rear fill only,if that much, leaving most of
the mid/hi-freqs to the front channels
* no x-overs on coaxials (network mounted on speaker usually) but not as
good sounding or power handling as separate components
* Focals, Quarts are excellent choices just remember the best speakers in a
poor location will sound worse than poor speakers in the best location
*  Sub sounds cool!  Be careful of sparks in the spare tire well - even if
you have a 'sealed' battery.  There was a report of at least one battery
explosion on this list.
* Use only properly rated components/interconnects.  The one lousy fuse
housing I scrimped on melted after 45 seconds of full-blast.  The good news
is that the lead (+ve) didn't ground out and set the car on fire - the bad
news is it was in the spare tire well too.

This is all for reminding myself too!

Do you plan on entering any shows with your 928?  Sounds like it will come
out nice and you could share it with others (most folks have never even
seen the insides of a 928!)

  
Have fun on your install !
Phil
