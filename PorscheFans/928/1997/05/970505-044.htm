For anybody who's interested... while installing new cam belt today on my
91GT a substantial oil leak was discovered around the base of the engine oil
filler assy. where it bolts to the block. After removing the intake manifold
assy (the only way to reach the bolts that hold the oil filler unit on) we
discovered it's held on by only 2 bolts & the thing is sealed by an O ring
that was leaking like a sieve. It will go back together with sealer on it.
The intake manifold housing is sure full of goo - should that be? the car
has 19k mi on it. Why did I replace the cam belt @ 19k mi? Cause it has 6
years on it & I can't afford a divorce over the cost of unscrambling 32 valves.
Incidentally, my LH Fuel Control ($1800) unit died 2 months before the 5 yr
warranty expired. It ran perfectly when put in the garage. On the next
attempt to start, it was stone dead. Flatbed time.
