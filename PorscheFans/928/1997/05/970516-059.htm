St=E9phane, have you ever flushed out your brake fluid?  Rarely is this d=
one,
even though it is recommended every two years.  What happens is that the =
fluid
will be dirty and full of moisture over the years.  Brake fluid (except t=
he
dreaded DOT 5) is very hydroscopic, and readily absorbs moisture from the=
 air.
 Not only will the moisture screw up the master cylinder, but it will als=
o
cause sticking problems with your brake calipers.  The contaniments make =
the
rubber seals swell which prevents the pistons from reliably retracting.

You can use the buddy system to pump it out or use a vacuum tool as sold =
by
Automotion.  Buy several *Quarts* of fine fluid, but be extremely careful=
 as it
is an effective paint stripper!  (For a car that hasn't been done in a wh=
ile, I
do this twice, with several weeks between fluid exchanges to allow all th=
e
contaniments to mix with the first fluid flush.)

If you really want to do a fine job, pull out your brake pads, and allow =
the
caliper pistons to come out a half inch or so.  (But be careful - there i=
s
nothing holding them from coming completely out.)  This way you can clean=
 and
inspect the pistons for pitting and corrosion.  If you notice any leakage=
 or
cracked boots, there are caliper rebuild kits available that allow you to=

replace all the seals in the caliper.

The water in the brake fluid lowers the boiling point of the fluid and co=
rrodes
the system internals.  So if you run it hard at the track, your brakes wi=
ll
stop working when the fluid boils (This is very exciting when it happens.=
=2E.)

It seems to me that professional mechanics don't like to do this much bec=
ause
it's time consuming and kind of a messy hassle.  But if you take good car=
e of
your calipers, I see no reason they shouldn't last forever.

If the calipers are working properly, the pads don't drag on the rotor. I=
 hope
this helps!
