It isn't actually too bad. Remember, there are two separate washer pumps
feeding two spray nozzles, and trying to maintain pressure in both
systems, with no flow between them. So each of the hoses that goes
into the hood goes to a tee, one outlet for each nozzle. Then there
are check valves all around, four total. The pairs of lines (one
each for regular and intensive) feed into inverse tees, and the 
outlet from those goes to the nozzle. Lots of rubber tubing and
plastic bits crammed into small spaces, but if it were laid out
in front of you it would be easy to figure out. 

In other words, go ahead and start pulling stuff out; there's a 
decent amount of slack in there. The hardest part is cramming it
all back in without pinching anything.
