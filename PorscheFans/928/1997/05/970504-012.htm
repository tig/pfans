re: value
Not right now but there is value for being a '78, at least in my book.  Did
you know you have 1978's Car of the Year in your garage?  Some prefer the
clean, unspoilered <ha> lines as well as that super rare checkboard
interior - does your car have that?  You got 'em 5 speed?  

re: color
I take it you have the brown interior as well?  (Well maybe not since
you're considering blue paint)  For originality you should stick with the
stock color, you might gain new appreciation for it when it's fresh. 
Otherwise have fun choosing the next color!  I'd go for that real
eye-catching gold - shines like a gemstone in sunlight.

You got 'em picture or jpeg?

Thanks,
Phil
