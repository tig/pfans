        I hope all you guys realize that the stock gauges aren't exactly a
rocet science in there opperation and that they aren't perfectly reading.
I've been reading the postings and it seems to me that if any one out there
had a problem it's fixed by now, and that now were just over analizing!  And
one other thing, some of us are inquiring about other gauge annoyances but
are listing under the oil pressure subject listing, could you bear the topic
of the disscusion to the subject of the header?
        Oh and by the way, Doug Hampton you made a small error in you last
e-mail about the feul sender, less resistance is equal to more fuel, not
vice versa.
        Also, hey Vince, havn't you got that dash board out yet??!!



No insult intended...
