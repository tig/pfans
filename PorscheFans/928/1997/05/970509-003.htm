>>Question:

>>

Your fan should blow at top speed when you put the control in the
"defrost" position, at the selected speed with the control in any
other position except "off." Sounds to me like it's working right.

That surprises me - I thought the air pump was just feeding air into
the exhaust system, at a point where it couldn't affect how the
engine ran. Can anybody explain this?
