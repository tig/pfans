Let's see what we can do to avoid this.

>I crashed my precious '83 928

How are you? If you're OK physically, how rattled are you? Is there
anything about the maneuver which leaves you with a question?

>The front right and rear right took most of the damage

How heavy is the damage? Did anything under the bodywork get bent or
broken? If so, what?

>the rear right wheel (17inch c2 replica) broke

Not big money by itself.

>the insurance company totaled it

This means that they expect to get more for selling it than they intend to
pay you. This alone should be a clue that the amount they're willing to pay
you is less than the value of the car, even to someone who doesn't care
about it.

To protect yourself, you should get a repair estimate from someone
competent (e.g., a good body shop plus a mechanical shop if things got
bent/broken underneath) and find out what it would take to get back on the
road. You can then challenge your insurer to pay for repairs, at least up
to the limit set by what they regard as the current value of the uncrashed
car.

If repair is ridiculously expensive, you might still prefer to sell the
crashed car for parts or salvage yourself. Ask some of the parts houses
(e.g., 928 International) and dismantlers (e.g., Kempton, Parts Heaven) for
some estimates and see whether this might at least put more money in your
pocket than selling to your insurer, which is what will happen if you
accept their "total" payment; they take the title and proceed to do what
they want with the car.

Meanwhile, everyone should be reminded that Blue Book-type values for 928
cars are far too low to use as a budget to buy comparable cars. Some
insurers will let you tell them an actual cash value for your older or
unusual car and then cover the car for that value, charging a proportionate
premium. If you don't do this, loss or destruction of your car will leave
you shy a lot of money.
