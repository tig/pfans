I put the high octane in my 85.  The best thing is to read your
owner's manual (if you do not have one, you can get one at your
local Porsche dealer or on other Porsche part store.  I bought mine
through http://www.my-porsche.com)

Again, the owner's manual should answer that.  My limited knoledge
indicate that our engine needs 20W50 in most driving situation.

That one, I recommend against.  DuPont has recommended against using
teflon in car engine because it gets too hot in there.  The stuff can
create goo that can restrict oil passages.  I even heard
people say that the stuff can decompose and make hydrofluoric acid...

I put a K&N in my car.  It is not expensive compared to the factory
filter ($45 compared to $23) and you get that little extra breathing.
I have no idea what chipping a 78 will do.

I'm surprised that your second car is not a tow truck!  :-)
