Ed & list,

Buy a master cylinder cap from your dealer ($3.50) then go to The Home
Depot and buy a pressurizable lawn sprayer for $15 and a piece of clear
plastic tubing.  Take your old master cylinder cap off, replace it with
the new one.  Then rumage through your junk box to find an appropriate
fitting (this could be hard or easy - maybe you have to buy one at the
hardware store).  Drill a hole in your old master-cylinder cap and then
use and O-ring to seal the fitting to the cap and push your plastic
tubing on.  Then, put it on the car and bleed away BUT DON'T USE TOO
MUCH PRESSURE (have NOT been there done that and don't want to).  Common
sense required here.

Disclaimer:  You're working with brakes which are an important safety
feature.  I might be and idiot and you might be too.  Do this at your
own risk.

Best,
Kurt
