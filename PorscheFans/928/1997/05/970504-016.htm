Have you checked the fuel filter?  It may be plugged just enough to allow
fumes, but not enough gas?  I had this problem on one of 928's.  Just a
guess.  You might also have a bad relay, even though you checked them.  I had
a no start, but crank and spark and gas, on a BMW.  This was from a bad main
relay.  I know the system is quite a bit different in the 928, but that may
also be the problem.

Good luck,

Brian Robinson
