Brian,

I agree about the location of the speaker.  However, I think that the
wiring might be a little weak if you try to put more power.

My though was to:
1. increase the speaker wire size
2. put an amp or 2 under the seats
3. Upgrade the speakers themselves, probably with passive crossover for
   better separation and control
4. Try to find subwoffers that would fit in the rear position (behind
the
   seats).

#4 is the biggest problem in my quest.  There is not many decent sub
that are
only 6".  If I could find boxes to put in that place that would hold 8",
I would be
all set.

Just my 0.02,
