This experience just felt too good, I have to share.

Yesterday, my fiance's cousin had his 13th birthday.  So last night I =
took him out for a drive in the 928, which he hadn't even had a chance =
to see until then.  As soon as we were out of site of his parents, I =
turned a corner and gave her everything she had before stopping at the =
next corner.

He said, "80 miles per hour in 2 seconds, AWESOME."

Granted this is an exageration on the kid's part, but we did make it to =
80 and we were going down hill, so it sure as Hell seemed like 2 =
seconds.

I took him around a few backroads and such to display its cornering =
ability, breaking power, and acceleration.  I think I had more fun than =
he did.  Eventually, as we were coming back to his parents house we got =
stuck behind a van and slowed way down.  This is a good thing.  We came =
back from the opposite direction into the subdivision than we came out =
of.  A cop was sitting there with someone pulled over.  If I had chosen =
to go that way when I first took off I would have gone to jail for sure.

When we got back, the first words out of his mouth were, "that car is =
the bomb."  In other words, he thought it was the best.  His dad wants a =
ride now.  I think I will convert this family of Corvette lovers one =
passenger at a time.

Later...
