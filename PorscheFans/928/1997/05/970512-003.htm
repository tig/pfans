Tim, the Mecedes-Benz unit in your car is controlled by and can be adjusted
with A. Modulator Pressure B. Working pressure C. Vacuum from engine. There
is also something called a "Bowden Cable" that is adjustable for the kickdown
engagement. Your local M--Benz dealer can help you. They have equip. that
connects to the trans while test driving that can read out the working
pressures/modulating pressures/etc. and tell you whats happening. Barring a
scud missle attack on your car by angry too-slow neighbors from Texas, this
should turn out to be a adjustment by the dealer. I would not suggest that
your local "transmission shop" work on your MB auto. Let a MB dealer or
Porsche Dealer look at it. They have the test equip to isolate and take care
of problem. Remember to service trans. each 30K miles, and "Jack will stay a
happy boy"
