Even if fuel is measured in Imperial gallons, a figure this high is only

likely to be observed with the engine shut off during a long downhill

coast. Be happy to beat 15 mpUSg in a 32V car (or be warned thereby that

you've been driving too slowly).

Well, after 1760 miles in 5 days, I turned in 20.5 MPG.  This include
sustained 110-125 through canada  (Usually about 20 minutes at time, with 10
to 20 minutes of 80, covering about 300 miles), and several 5 to 10 mile runs
above 125 in U.S.  But overall the cruise was on at 73-75.  My normal around
town is about 15 MPG.
