It's a very good idea to put true GTS-spec wheels and tires on your S4 or
GT. You'll get crisper handling, better overall stick, and room for the
even-more-formidable GTS brakes. However, It is VITALLY IMPORTANT that you
NOT use any old generic wheels, and that you be fussy about tires.

Porsche wheels are built to significantly higher specs than the DOT or T=DCV
specs mentioned in Tire Rack ads. This is not a gloss. Wheels can and do
crack, and even lose their centers under hard cornering and braking, and
you won't want to be in the car when this happens. When you're driving a
heavy, very powerful car capable of extremely high speeds and fast braking,
you want all the margin you can get.

Also, 928 wheels have different offsets from those used for 911s, so
generic "Cup" or "Technology" wheels may not fit properly.=20

For these reasons, I strongly encourage you to check in with Wheel
Enhancement (http://www.wheelenhancement.com/), where you'll find the
greatest concentration of knowledge about Porsche wheels and fitments
anywhere outside the factory, along with a practical attitude which will
lead to your getting a reliable, correctly fitting wheel-and-tire package
for a very competitive price.
