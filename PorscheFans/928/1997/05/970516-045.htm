Matt,

  I just looked in the Devek catalog to see what they say about the
  radiators (their catalog gives a lot of good technical info on the
  weak points of the 928).  They say the seals between the aluminum core
  and plastic end tanks do have a limited service life, but they don't
  give estimates.  Perhaps the seals can be replaced? 
  
  Anyway FYI, Devek lists aluminum radiators with better heat dissipation 
  characteristics than stock for approx 2/3 the cost.  Hopefully you don't
  need a new radiator, but if you do, their's may be a good alternative.
