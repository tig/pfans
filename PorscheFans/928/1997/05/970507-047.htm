	Mark, I have a Tri-amp system with X-over mounted in my spare tire well. I 
have more watts than horsepower. I will be putting the GTS brakes on and will 
have almost no need for my spare. I have AAA gold service, and a cell phone. I 
would be afraid to drive on an 8+ year old, collapsable spare anyhow. Anyway, 
Phil has a picture of my amp install, ( I think ) so if he would be kind 
enough to post it you can see what I did. The four 7" ADS subs sound good, 
again, ask Phil. So far the fronts are stock, driven by a four channel amp, 
but will soon be replaced by Boston PRO series. If anyone wants the stock 
speakers let me know.
