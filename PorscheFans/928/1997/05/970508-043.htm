Hi all.  I'm new to the Porsche 928 ownership "club."  What a fantastic
car.  I had heard of them but had no idea how they performed.  After
talking with my son about how small and vulnerable a Miata would be to
own we agreed that he should take a look at the Porsche 928.  Well, he
eventually purchased a 1983 928 and let me drive it.  Talk about being
hooked!  I now own a black-on-black 1985 928 S with an after-market S4
front and rear clip.  (I bought it that way.)
I've been reading about some of the same problems I'm having with my
car.  Here are some of them:
=B7 The oil pressure gage is always reading full scale as soon as the key
is turned on but the engine not started.  There is no change when the
engine is started; the gage still reads full scale.
=B7 There seems to be a "chirping" noise coming from the area of the
torque tube.  Is this a "typical" bearing noise for this type of car?=20
I've read that it could also be a transmission bearing.
=B7 The steering seems a bit heavy at low speeds.  Anyone have any
comments on the steering characteristics? =20
=B7 None of the door lights are operational.  Neither is the dome light.=20
Dash lights are ok.  The power to the console clock goes out when either
door is opened.  The electric release for the rear hatch doesn't work
either.  Since I don't, as yet, have wiring diagrams for the car I would
be troubleshooting in the dark.  All of the fuses are ok.  Any words of
wisdom?
=B7 My leather dash is also cracked.  I've purchased a "repair kit" for
leather and vinyl.  We'll see how it goes.
=B7 I've noticed that the plug wires have some cracks.  They will be
replaced soon.  Any comments as to what to replace them with?  (I've got
the 928 International catalog, along with Automotion, Performance and
Tweeks.)

This forum looks great for an exchange of information.  Hopefully, I can
contribute something in the future.
