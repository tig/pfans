Leonard,


I decided to post this in case someone has some insight into what I am
trying to do. I can do 10 updates per second running 38.4k baud on the
rover to the laptop for logging.  The Differential station updates at 1
Hz over a 4800bps wireless link and is interpolated (forward predicted by
the rover. This latency only means 5 to 10cm of accuracy loss.


Position Accuracy is 40cm for the short baselines that i have in mind. 
Velocity accuracy is 0.05 mph. I log to a laptop and process in Excell or
Matlab.  I will have to come up with a test run protocol that is similar
to the inertia wheel dyno tests.  I figure multiple passes (in opposite
directions) for each scenario (chip) to compensate for wind, slope.


I presume they usually use 4th or 5th gear and start at 1000 rpm or so
and go full throttle until redline.  4th makes sense for a road test so
that I don't have to drive at 160mph and it will also make the wind
resistance a lot less of a factor.


The most challenging part will be to find a suitable place to do the runs
in the Phoenix Area.  I will also weigh the car before the test.


I will <bold><underline>HAPPILY</underline></bold> publish the results
since no chip manufacturer would give me dyno results for a GT.  I
presume that this is because the increase in performance on a GT is
negligible for any chip upgrade.  


Regards

Frank Neuperger

Red 1990 GT


PS  The K&N filter discussion has got me ready to send my uninstalled
filter back.  The desert area here is notorious for frequent dust storms
and fine grain sand. This stuff is always being kicked up by the cars
ahead of you. I may just hang on to it out of intellectual curiosity for
when I run my chip tests.
