This should be an easy one.....I don't have access to my books right 
now as I am abroad (and missing my turbo terribly...).  Anyway,

VIN:
WPOJB0921HS860900

Only need to know/confirm the year (i.e. what model year was H?).  I 
was told '87 but from the 'S4 or GT' thread stating K was '89, either 
H is then '86 or '87 (if 'I' was skipped for obvious reasons...).  Is 
this an S4?

I haven't made it inside the car yet to check the engine and options 
codes....  Does anyone have the range of engine serial numbers for 
this VIN so I can check that when I get under the hood?

Does the 928 GTS decal mean anything?  Or is that just an 'add-on'?

Thanks,


Ralf Siemens

Pry off the door knob cover.  I used a small putty knife against the 
ridge's edge and the plastic button cover.  DON'T PRY BEHIND THE KNOB. 
THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO REMOVE IT!  Remove retaining screw and pull out 
knob.  Use your palm to put pressure against the round piece and rotate 
it counter-clockwise.  Remove recessed screw behind door handle.  You 
need to slight open door handle to see and access it.  Pry off small 
panel piece close to door handle area and above arm rest.  Open arm 
rest compartment and pry off  plastic nut caps and unscrew bolt.  Go to 
hinged-side of door.  Remove the circular ventilation plastic piece.  
There will be a plastic nut caps and bolt; remove it.  Lift arm rest 
assembly off door panel carefully.  You'll see a bunch of wires going 
to the mirror switch assembly.  Disconnect it and note the wire color 
and where it is connected.  Pry off panel along side of door and lift 
it up off the lip on top of panel.  I suggest that you get a panel 
removal tool from your local parts house.  Cost about $6 and will 
prevent you from damaging the door panel. ($$$)

I can almost bet that the clunking sound is coming from the window 
motor assembly not being bolted down.  If it is loose, use some blue 
lock-tite on the bolt along with a locking washer.  Just reposition the 
assembly to its original position; use the scratched paint caused by 
the bolts as guide.  If it is the window guides, then you're into some 
more serious disassembly.

This is also a good time to inspect/lubricate your door latch and such. 
 Pay particular attention to linkages.  The couplers are plastic and 
subject to wear.

By the way, I was told that there is a tech bulletin on the window 
guides.  It has to do with an upgrade that will prevent the rattling of 
the window glass.

Let me know how it work out and best of luck!

Oh, yeah... forgot about this shield that's used to prevent water from 
getting on to the electro-mechanical servo unit with digital-pulsed 
control via 3 channel at a 35ms stepping rate gizmo. :-)  Darn those 
smart Stuggart Engineers!

Yup, you need to remove it first, and voila!
