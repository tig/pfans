Hello all,
A couple questions: (Refering to an 87' model)
Regarding the Stargate Superion headlight bulbs seen in the 928s4vr
modifications; (nice site--thanks ptong!)   ----        I'd like to install
them in my car, but am still concerned, as the stock bulbs are 45 watts low
and 65 watts high and these are 80 watts low and 100 watts high, which
equates to amperage increases from 3.75 to 6.66 low and 5.42 to 8.33 high. 
Will this additional 3 amps require a bigger wire gage or fuse or both?

Also, an easy, cheap, and safe way to bleed your brakes.
Take mason jar - get some clear tubing that fits snugly over brake bleeder
fittings : (1piece 2 ft. long, and 1 piece about 6 ft. long)
Put two tubing diameter holes in the mason jar lid and run the 2 ft. piece of
tubing to the bottom of the jar and the 6 ft. piece near the top of the jar.
(must be tight fits)
Remove brake fluid reservoir cap










































                                                                      Connect
the 2 ft. piece to the bleeder fitting
Connect the 6 ft. piece to any vacuum source on your car (or other car) and
start car
Break bleeder fitting lose and close after no more air or dirty brake fluid
comes out.
Be sure not to let brake fluid reservoir go empty. Repeat, working from wheel
nearest master cylinder to farthest.

This is a great forum and I anxiously await everyones input/output every day.
Thanks, and happy 928ing.      Make like a missile and cruise.
