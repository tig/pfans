Probably your pin switches.  Clearly your wiring is also crossed at some
point in the car because of the clock.  The electric rear release is not
energized unless a door is open (safety), and the pin switches tell the trunk
release a door is open, therefore if you fix the pin switches (about $4.50
each at dealer), you may have solved 90% of these problems.  

Good Luck,

Now that my 928 is torn apart, I'm tempted to replace all fuses with an 
electronic counterpart and relays with TRIAC/SCRs.  Hmmm.. John, you 
got me thinking...  Veerry inteeerressting...
