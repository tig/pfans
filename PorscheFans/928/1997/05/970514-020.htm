  You're the second one on this list that has a 928 pickup.
  Morten Sivertsen (morten@uniteam.com (from Germany I believe)) also
  has an S4 pickup and he sent me pictures of them (.bmp format). 
  His was a very well exectuted conversion.
  
  As for me, I'm going to keep my 928 a 2+2;  I'll use my limited
  edition Ford SVT F-150 Lightning when I need to haul large cargo quickly!

  I think the group will accept this.  Those guys that were talking
  about putting Chevy engines into a 928 may be a different story though!
