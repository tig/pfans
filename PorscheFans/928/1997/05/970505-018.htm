  I thought so too, which is why I need to check with Amsoil's tech department to
  see why they limit the range of model years.  I'll post what I find after 
  I call.

Question:  do you need to remove the windshield first before removing 
the dash?

>2) The cruise control is intermittent and can sometimes work even with 
the

This is possible since the cruise control disconnect occurs when you 
use the brake.

Check speed sensor, instrumentation cluster electrical connection; edge 
connectors on bottom of cluster on each side; check for electrical 
contact of rivets on printed circuit "board".

You might need to replace the fuel pump since there should be residual 
fuel pressure in the fuel line even when engine is not running. Your 
check valve is leaking therefore you need to crank engine alot to build 
up fuel pressure prior to starting.  Unfortunately, the check valve is 
located within the fuel pump.  You can put a check valve inline with 
the fuel line and get the same result; cheaper.... Volvo uses a 
separate check valve in their fuel system.  That's an alternative.
