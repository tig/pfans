Hi James:

Thanks for your reply!  I just now noticed your email handle - pretty
trick... Larry is  happy with his IMS van for now but I'm sure a younger
person like yourself will make good use of modern products - who knows
maybe even burn some midnight oil and continue in the Porsche tradition of
continuous improvement!

Imagine the possibilities with one of those 928 pickup conversions!
