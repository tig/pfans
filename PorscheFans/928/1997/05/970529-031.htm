I never did the procedure but I remember someone mentioning that the
complexity came from the duality of the washing system!!  Our
car has a regular washing system and the "power" wahing system with
the "Porsche special" washing fluid.  Because the two systems feed
through the same nozzles, it requires all that extra piping and check
valves to prevent one system to pump into the other one.

Now, if that was clear to you, please explain it back to me in
simple terms ;-0

I've had the pleasure of working on the windshield washer system 
before, and actually it's pretty easy.  All those check valves are used 
to keep the washer system pressurized so that when you turn it on, 
there will not be any delay in the washer fluid being delivered to the 
windshield.  The valves do wear out and its relatively cheap.. (I think 
I paid about $2 apiece.)  It does take patience to remove all the hoses 
within the hood.  (at least on my '83 anyway, but not sure how the 
other years are plumbed...)
