You need to be concerned about the headlight relay contacts also.
For some reason, the relay used has contacts rated for only 10 amps,
which has to provide current for both headlights. So it's marginal
even for the standard headlights. Doesn't sound very Porsche-like
to me. The relay is easy to replace, but fairly expensive - $60 comes
to mind. Nobody on this list has mentioned frying one, though, so
maybe there's more margin than I think.
