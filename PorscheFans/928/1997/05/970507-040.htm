After a drive down the highway, with a friend of mine trailing in a 993
cabrio, he told me about smoke coming from my exhaust whenever I would
shift and accelerate hard. What is happening to cause this? Is there
something wrong with the car? "Just a puff, but definitely smoke," is the
way he described it.

(and by the way, it really made my day finding out that my 12 year old 928
had the muscle to outrun a 95' 993 in a highway situation. I guess that's
where the 928 comes into its domain)
