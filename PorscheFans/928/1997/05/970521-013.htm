Stephane,

  I didn't get _all_ of the details, but I got the impression that
  some major service history would be listed (based on my impression, if a
  speedo was replaced by the dealer, that would show up, for example).
  
  Give them a call - they're very nice to deal with.  I had called the other
  day after the group was having a flurry of activity about option codes.
  My car didn't have the option code sticker under the mat, so I called to
  ask them what the options were.  They could tell me the option numbers,
  but because of the age of my car, they couldn't correlate those numbers
  to the actual option.  I was able to find most of them from postings, and
  Leonard came to the rescue on all but one other.  In fact, yesterday
  I got a letter in the mail from PCNA thanking me for my continued interest
  in their cars and inviting me to call back with any other questions.  Neat!
  
  You'll need the VIN to get any info over the phone, of course.
  
Jim S.
