Mark, my 86 usually starts off in first gear.  I don't think my wife's
Mercedes does however.  I certainly agree with you on the downshift to
first.  However, according to my owner's manual, at speeds over 25 mph,
it will not downshift to first (Not sure if the Mercedes does).  I wish
somebody came up with a fix for that.  It would make a big difference
driving around town (80% of my driving).  I had my mechanic look at it,
but he said there was no easy fix for the downshift.
