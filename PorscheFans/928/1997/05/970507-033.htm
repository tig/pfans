OK, here's the latest in my cruise control quest.

The symptoms are that it will either work perfectly, or not work at all.  No
apparent correlation to engine RPM, speed (above 30 MPH), gear, accel/decel,
turning/straight, or whatever.

Ran thru all diagnostics from the factory manual.  Only one test didn't
checkout perfectly.  There are two wires coming from the vac servo under the
left fender.  With the ignition off, the resistance accross these wires at
the cruise control brain's plug should be about 14 ohm.  Then, the manual
says, the resistance should go to infinity.

The manual never says how fast it should go to infinity, nor what it implies
if it doesn't.

Well, as you may guess, the resistance I get is 15.2 ohm and it remains
constant over a 10 minute period, even after I shorted the two leads
together.  At the time there was vacuum in the system.

Before I start throwing money at the folks at 928 International, has anyone
got any ideas?

TIA!

Seems like you should be able to disconnect the coupler from the tranny 
end and run the engine.  You should quickly determine whether it's the 
tube bearing or the tranny input bearing that's going out.  Am I 
correct?
