I have a 1985 928 that had a similar problem.  My sons 1983 928 also had
problems with non-operational seat controls on the passenger side.
I took apart the switches and cleaned the contacts.  I sprayed the
inside of the switch with WD40 before putting them back togeather and
re-installing.  The seats now work fine.  This worked on two cars, each
with more than one switch position being non-funtional.

The switches may look like they don't come apart but they do. Just put
them back together the way you took them apart.  There is a difference
between the '83 and '85 switches but the "fix" procedure worked for
both.

Good luck.
