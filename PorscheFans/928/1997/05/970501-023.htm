Greetings,

I've recently become a 928 owner so I though I would join in on all this
fun.  The car is a not so pristine '84 model.  It's got 140k miles on it but
it still runs great. I've got several questions about the car but I'll limit
it to a couple of easy ones for starters.

First of all, I would like to find out what the original color of the car
was.  It's obviously been repainted but I can't find any traces of the
original paint.  I have the color code (9999VK) from the original sticker so
maybe someone knows of a source for a cross reference.

Next question.  I've got a problem with a window that sticks when rolling up
so I thought I would take a look at it.  Removing the door panels was
straight forward except for one problem - I could not get the door lock knob
off to remove the last panel.  Is there a trick to this or do I simply pry
till it pops.  I've got enough broken parts already, so I don't need another.  

Thanks for the help.
