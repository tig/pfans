More than nice, it's really necessary, and requires a scale at each wheel
so you can get each wheel to bear down with the same force. This a project
that's easy to start, but difficult to finish correctly.

Not so. You're running the wheels up into the wheel wells. Either the bump
stops or the inside of the fender well will limit upward travel, so a hard
"jounce" will become abruptly much harder. Serious lowering should probably
be done with shorter, higher rate springs, so that the wheel will travel
upwards less for the same applied force.

and everything else. Don't casually screw around with your suspension geometry!
