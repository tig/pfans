      Matt,  a  few months ago I had a problem with a antifreeze leak. I
          had just replaced my
      water pump, the pressure from the new waterpump and new radiator
          hoses caused
       my heater hose to burst and leak. The antifreeze would leak into the
           front wiper reservior
      and very little would  end up on the ground. The antifreeze light
          would come on but the tempurature
       did not rise. I was filling the antifreeze reservior every morning.
            After tracing the leak I discover that the heater hose near the
           front
      firewall (beneath the wipers) had a leak. It was quite a task to
          replace. (removed the front hood, then the wipers)
      The toughest thing to locate were the replacement hoses. I hope this
          will help you.

      Check that your heater hose is not leaking. Check where the hose
          connected to your heating unit.

      I love this car so much I am going to purchase another in about 9
          months, I want to chop the top to the second one
       and make it a convertible. Wow! a convertible and a hard-top (the
          ultimate!)
