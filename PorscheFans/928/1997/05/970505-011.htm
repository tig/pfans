Mark, I've had a problem almost identical to yours.  Full throttle on the
San Diego Freeway and ... dead silence as the engine quit dead.  Restart was
successful, but ran into *very* bad performance, sluggish, etc.  Mechanic
couldn't find problem, so tried a tune up.  No go.  Then I heard the fuel
pump making lots of noises.  Silly me, I thought it was the pump causing my
problems.  Nope.  The fuel pressure regulators on the firewall were replaced
by the mechanic and no more problems.  

By the way, the vac. line running to the fuel pressure regulators snapped
somewhere during the process so I don't know if it broke before or during
the repair.

Anyway, he found it by using a fuel pressure meter and monitored the
pressure as the engine was run.  He said the pressure read perfect for a
while and then just shot up off the scale.

Good luck on your problem.

Originally I wanted to video-tape the whole process; just to document 
how certain parts are taken off so that I can put it back together 
again.  That didn't work out because it's taking too much time to 
setup, etc..

Good idea!  I'll start as of today! ....

I've been unsuccessful in locating a copy.  Anyone have an extra copy 
that they care to part with?
