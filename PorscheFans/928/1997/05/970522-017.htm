Leonard:  This is obviously a very serious matter to you, and well it
should be.  Flying airplanes is, and always was, a serious matter to me.
I responded to Sam's incorrect statement about aircraft engines (w/o
catalytic converters) and it must have landed in your 1st cup of coffee
or something. However, I don't think either one of us knows what we're
talking about when it comes to mixture and emission control on Porsche
automobiles. From what little I do know, I think that Sam was on the
right track looking at the OX sensor.  I know so little that I thought
it better not to venture an opinion as you did. Actually, if you read
the message from Steve Smith a few back from yours, you will find a
correct statement. There are two issues, engine mixture and catalytic
converter mixture and they are interrelated in such a complex system
that it is beyond my capabilities to attempt to explain, even if I could
understand it.
