Phil:

The German authorities require every car to be equipped with a first aid kit.
That's why many European manufacturers have intelligent storage spaces
installed in their cars, that can exactly take a standard size hard box kit
(those kits are also available in pillow form).

I am not exaclty sure, where the location was in the 928s, however, I believe
it was in the passenger legroom area, on the right, underneath the underdash
trays.

Regarding your headlight lenses: The European H4 lenses create an asymetric
area of light in front of the car, that is longer and higher on the left in
the UK and longer on the right in the rest of Europe. When travelling outside
of the UK, the Brits are required to cover the area of the lens that creates
the long range light on the left, because it would blind oncoming traffic. 

Why did they design the headlights that way? I know of two reasons: 
1. The asymetric lights generally allow for a wider range without blinding
oncoming traffic, and allow you to see people walking or objects on the side
of the road early.
2. Highways and Autobahns in Germany (and probably in most other European
countries - I just don't remember...) have white plastic markers with white
reflectors on each side of the road. With the asymetric light you can see way
ahead where the street goes, allowing for safer, faster driving.
Also: Keep in mind that these lights were introduced at times when the
Europeans did not have that many multiple lane roads. I have heard, but from
my experience don't share concerns about blinding people in their rear
mirrors when driving offset behind them. 

How can you tell, which lenses you have? The easiest way is probably to find
the wedge shaped area on the lens. Is it on the curb side/right of your car,
you have the right lense. Is it on the street side/left, you have UK lights
and don't get full benefit of them here in the US.

P.S. BTW: The Swedish have developped a headlight that includes UV light.
White objects such as the white road markers or the white hair on dears legs
can be seen much earlier, especially in the rain. I don't know if this kind
of light ever made it into a production car, though...
