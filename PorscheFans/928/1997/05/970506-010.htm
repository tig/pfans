>>>5)The starting seems to take alot of cranking but if I ensure the fuel

cranked the

|You can check the fuel pressure at a fitting on the front of one
|of the fuel rails. Do that before you spring for a new pump or
|check valve. Somebody had the cute idea of connecting an oil
|pressure sensor there, and wiring it to the oil pressure gauge
|via a switch, so that you could have an instant check on the
|pressure. Cute, though a leak would be kind of nasty.

John's right, this is the first thing to check.  If everything is ok with the 
fuel system, you're going to have fuel pressure when you open up that rail -- 
be careful.  Attach a pressure gauge to the rail and then try various 
scenarios of cold starts, warm starts, letting the car sit over night, etc.  
Record not only pressure but also record when pressure is seen.  For example: 
cold start, 40psig after 7 seconds or cranking, anyway, you get the idea.
This data will tell you interpret if the fuel pump is good, if the check valve 
is good, or if everything is good... then it's on to another system.
