I am considering having some drop in replacement speakers made for the 928,
and am interested in hearing how many people would be interested in
purchasing them if they were available.  They would be high quality, not the
ultimate audiophile speaker, but high quality.  I am considering this because
of the time and trouble involved in replacing the speaker systems in these
cars. 

I beleive the stock locations are good already.  They could be improved upon,
but if I was able to drop something into the stock wiring I wouldn't take the
trouble to improve the locations.  As an aside I am also considering making a
drop in replacement for the stock amp that could sit in the factory location
and provide more power.  I would want the stock speakers to work off of the
stock crossovers,and use the stock wiring in all locations.  I would want the
amp to work in the stock location, and use the stock wiring, with the
exception of the DIN cable for the Blaupunkt amps.

Any thoughts, from anyone, on these ideas are appreciated.  I am interested
in hearing what you would think a full set of speakers would be worth to you.
 And if you have any opinions on price or anything else, let me know what
year of car so that I know the stock configuration of the speakers.  I have
experience with my '85 and '89, if the '84 and older cars have different
speaker set ups, let me know.

Thanks,
