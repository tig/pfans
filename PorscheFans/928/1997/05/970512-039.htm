Men, with all those british car, you must be a master electrical 
troubleshooter ;-))

Anyway, check the hazard light real fast and the rear passenger light
(yellow of course) is a little dimmer.  I will try to chase the ground
tomorrow.

For the break switch, it is located at the top of the break pedal.  It
is
on the side of the driver (ie. the switch is normaly pushed in by the
pedal until you puch on the brake).  The wires going to it are black and 
red/black.

I hope this make sense to you and you have additional advice...
