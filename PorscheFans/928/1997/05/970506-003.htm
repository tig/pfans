It's not going to be worth it IMO - easier & cheaper to fit 'off-the-shelf'
drivers to your application than become a manufacturer of sorts.  (How do
you plan to do it anyways?)  I applaud you're plans to upgrade over stock
though - especially the early systems with their inevitably dried and
cracked paper cones!

> I beleive the stock locations are good already.  

For the serious sound enthusiast, not really in regards to imaging and
balance (any singers and/or musicians around here?).  But they do look
cool.  Expect to do much tweaking & freq'g and still not be happy (if
you're into this kind of stuff anyways).  

If you are into this then you already know the problems.  The front tweets
need to be pointing at opposite seats for best imaging - not directly at
each other!  Would have to play with post mounting for best placement
(might even need to point at the roof).  Compression tweets would fit in
both trays pretty good though (later cars no trays, more of a
mounting/hiding  challenge).   The mid's should go down in the kickpanels
but then the high console gets in the way of the soundwaves.  The passenger
rears are too close to the front seat occupants and mess up stage imaging,
might be better to get rid of them all together.  The very rear tweets are
useless.  There's no place to hide a good size sub, unless you forsake the
spare or passenger seats (hey there's an idea! at least one of them). Boxes
the best compromise?  You could probably tune out any weird hatch
reflections at least.  Amp mounting again poses a challenge depending upon
dimensions but less so than speaker placement.  If you think this is nuts,
you really need to sit and listen to a properly setup car - it's mind
blowing and freaky, like the first time you ever noticed dolby surround
effects!  Speaking of which, many mfrs are beginning to bring out auto DSP
products with all those effects - phantom center channels, listening modes,
pro-logic, rear delay circuits, etc.  Anyways, the 928 can be done though -
at least it has a cockpit with some volume and working space to be
creative.

For most of us, me included, this can go  a little overboard!  You do what
makes you happy!  It's just the competitor in me thinking about taking
everything to the limit.  (dammit Jim let's get that race car!)  And why I
(will) drive a 928 :) and not a 'vette I guess! (anyone read that road test
where the Viper couldn't pull past 150 in 6th?)

Don't forget the stock drivers are wired off each other!  This might
require you to pull new cable for the correct gauge at least...  Stock
loc's the easiest to do though!

If your amp is the one under that little cover, there's not enough room for
a serious amp to replace it!  And this car if any NEEDS a sub + sub-amp,
what with that bellowing V8 and all.  Funny though, after installing my
system I was always turning it down just to listen to the motor rise and
fall.  (Somebody help me)

The '84 setup is identical to the '85, although I've heard some cars
especially older ones do not have exterior speaker grills - the drivers are
behind perforated panels!  That project is going to be problematic getting
the panels to fit back nicely, especially if they've shrunk in any way. 

Very important for cruising and the 928 needs some serious sound!  I spent
close to $1200 on speakers alone and these were entry-level audiophile. 
With proper speaker placement, the amp and sub's make any system.  

Pick up a copy of Auto Sound & Security magazine or similiar and be amazed
at what's going on in the car audio world nowadays.  I was!  Imagine a
motorized 928 hatch activated by alarm remote control, then motorized
luggage cover revealing a motorized and neon'd rotating sub-chamber/amp
rack. Flushed in fuse/wire distribution panel and caps.  Eq readouts hidden
in rearview mirror. Kilowatts of power, enough to dB drag race a jetplane. 
Yipes!  I'd never do that of course, just demonstrating what is being done
for those of us who've been 'out of it' due to career/study/whatever..

 My next system is going to be way different and I can't wait (whoops there
goes the racecar money)!

Wow, I really apologize for going on and on!  This is one of my favorite
subjects though - and I really appreciate the individuality of each car's
setup, no matter what if any was spent on it.  Even more so if it was a DIY
project.  It's something to do with shiny lights, miniaturized components,
bundled cables, TECH, etc.
