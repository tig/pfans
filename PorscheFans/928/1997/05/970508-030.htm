I cannot disagree BUT, the problem is that my gauge, and it appears that
other people gauge, fails and indicate 5 bars all the time.  IMHO, if
you turn the ignition and the gauge peggs at 5 bars, you should check it
out.  If you discover that you cannot read the resistance between the
two
terminal of the gauge, the gauge should be changed.

If on the other hand you get ~5.2 ohm reading from your gauge, and when
the
engine is running the gauge is always pegged, you should have no problem
UNLESS
your oil bypasss are not working properly.
