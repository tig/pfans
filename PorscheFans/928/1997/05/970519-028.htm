Hi All!

I am still climbing about under my 928S and have just replaced the
alternator cooling pipe as the old one was very ragged. Whilst in there, I
thought that I had better check the exterior air temperature sensor that
sits in a metal ring in this pipe. I assume that it is a thermistor and that
it should read some ohms but it registered open circuit. I even thought that
it may be a thermocouple but it didn't give out any voltage reading on my
digital multimeter which has a resolution of 1mV, even when heated. I guess
that it is stuffed. If it is expensive to replace, I am thinking of
replacing it with a fixed resistor that corresponds to 20 degrees centigrade
(68F) as, here in Brisbane, we rarely get below 5 degrees or above 35
degrees. I am also wondering why the system even needs to measure outside
air temperature. It is the cabin temperature that is important. Maybe it has
to consider air conditioner evaporator icing when defrosting in cold
weather. I would love some answers, particularly what resistance equates to
20 degrees centigrade.
