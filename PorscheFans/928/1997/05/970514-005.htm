Stephanae: Call Automotion (they have a 800#). They have excellent rebuilt
compressors for around $2-$300 and come with a 18 months warranty. You do not
need to buy a "factory" dealer compressor. Also, sometimes it's not the
compressor but simply the compressor clutch or controlling switch. My rec. is
to have Porsche dealer DEFINE the problem part, and if it's not compressor,
have them take care of it. If they say it IS the compressor, pick one up from
Automotion and hand the dealer the compressor. Hi, install this & recharge
system :-)

Kevin, I read your nice post on the auto vs. 5spd. and I have to agree with
your driving impressions as a whole. I too, have a auto, have driven a
5-speed, and definately will take the automatic any time. For around town,
open road (not race track), grand touring at high speed, you name it, the
automatic is slick. My 90' 4spd.automatic is one of the latter iterations of
the famed "bulletproof" automatics mfg. by Mercedes-Benz for Porsche. Porsche
required a higher capability auto for the 326 hp. 928S4 series, so they used
the same trans. as in the 325hp. 500E. Perfect match. I do respectfully
disagree on your"tourque converter" and "do have" issues. The torque
converter in a MB auto is built like a tank, and one would have to purposely
run low on trans fluid and overheat their car, beat it up, rev. engine and
SLAM it into gear to affect damage on the torque converter. In regards to the
trans & internals itself, by the time one gets to about (average) 200,000+
miles, you can replace the "clutch packs" (this is what wears inside) for
about $1,500, or you can opt. to have the entire trans rebuilt for about
$2,500 (though there would be no need for this unless one damaged it by
complete negligent abuse).Also, the #1 & # 2 reason for any MB trans to "get
cranky" in any way is owners NOT checking the trans. fluid level resivoir
PROPERLY when the engine is warm (people overfill/underfill), and don't
change the trans. oil & filter each 30K miles. Have a nice day :-) and enjoy
that Auto.
