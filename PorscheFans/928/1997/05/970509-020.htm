        I'm looking for feed back on the thought of welding in a roof from
an "S" onto my 1978.  I'd be removing the glass and cutting at the posts.
I'd probably have a frame shop do the swap, but then I'll finish up the
structural welding to make shure it's good for me and not the body shop
guys!!  I have my hands on a complete 1984 928S roof from an auto wrecker,
the car was hit perpendicular to the front of the nose.  I plan to do
several measurments to enshure it is straight, but I expect it to be good.
As for wiring, it appears that my 1978 is equiped with all the electrics for
one with the exception of the actual switch for the roof on the console.

        Has any one done this in the group?

There is 9 of them.
There is just too many!

But the implication is glorious, isn't it?

I've never played with the gas gauge before, but hopefully within the 
next two weeks, I'll have the dash off and be able to take a good look 
at its internal.  Unfortunately, my 928 is in a stage of restoration 
right now... but if I recollect, my gas gauge is behaving the same as 
yours.

I don't see why the gauge shouldn't have a trimmer pot unless the 
sender unit and gauge are manufactured with a 1% resistance tolerance.  
And we all know that gauges aren't suppose to be accurate anyway. :-)  
I hope some of you don't use the tach to adjust RPM because the 
accuracy is somewhere in the 20% range.  If there is a trimmer on the 
gas gauge, then you shouldn't have any problem making adjustment to it. 
 The only thing that I would be cautious about is when the low fuel 
light comes on.  You don't want to adjust the gauge as such that there 
will be no gas in the tank when the light comes on!

Ahh... the good 'o reliable Triplett Voltmeter!  What innovation when 
they decided to put a mirror strip along the needle's travel to prevent 
paralax!  Brings back some good memories!
