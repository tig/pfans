The spec book for 80-84 928's says that the pads, front (both kinds)
and rear _start_ life at 13mm (just an RCH over 1/2") and that the
wear limit is a startling 2mm. That is, just 2mm remaining. So your
son is being conservative. Looks to me like the place that did the
inspection was looking for some business. 

The backing plate on the pad is maybe 1/8", and if you peer in there
without taking the wheel off it's kind of hard to see where the
backing plate ends and the pad material starts, but they were not
doing right by you.
