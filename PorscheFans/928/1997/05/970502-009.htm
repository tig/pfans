Kind of interesting. The interior lights and the clock power both
come from the same fuse (fuse 23 on an '84). Should have power all
the time. Do the interior lights come on if you open the door when
the car is running? Do they come on with their built-in switches?
A common problem is just the door switch failing. Kind of hard
to guess if the wirings been buggered up though.

>>2. The second (and sometimes the first) gear 'creaks'. The first two or 
>>three times I put the car in second gear it makes a noise, like grinding 
>>teeth. What is this?? Synchronising??
>>
Early 928 synchronizers have a limited lifetime, and cold stiff gear
lube makes them worse. Make sure you have synthetic gear lube in
your transaxle (it doesn't get as thick when cold) and learn to
live with it, shifting with care when cold.
