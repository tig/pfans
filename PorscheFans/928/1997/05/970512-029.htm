I hope I'm not just repeating what other people have already said,
but I won't know until tonight (the disadvantage of being a digester).

From my experience with other cars, the problem sounds indicative of
a fault with the engine coolant temperature sensor (if there is one!).
In my Festiva (granted, an entirely different class of car, but ECM
units don't do things *that* differently) for example, if the sensor
fails, the ECM will run on the assumption of a coolant temperature of
20 C, which means it will seem normal on cold, but once the engine
heats up, you get poor performance.

The fact that you didn't experience the problem Saturday would seem
to indicate that you might have an intermittent fault in the wiring
to the sensor, or the sensor itself is intermittent.

Take this advice for what it is--that of a guy who's never actually
even seen a 928 in person, let alone worked on one.  ^_^
