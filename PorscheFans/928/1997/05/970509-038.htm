Looking at the picture of the fuel sending unit in the parts and
technical reference catalog, The fuel level sending unit does not appear
to be of the "float" design.  It probably just measures the resistance
of the fuel in the tank.  This is very common in aircraft.  Less fuel
less resistance, more fuel more resistance.  This would allow you to be
able to accurately measure the fuel in any shaped tank.
