>>Hello-  I have  a friend who wanted me to get info on 928's. His question
is
>>can you buy  an older model car like between 82-86

Seeing as how your friend is amenable to an '85 or '86, what's wrong with 288
HP?  How much of a difference is there between 300 and 288 anyway?  You could
also chip it and install a K&N and comfortably get over 300 on the '85 or
'86.  

Buy a lower milage '85 or '86 (somewhere between 12K and 15K for a very good
example), and install headers, chips, exhaust, air filter, and cam if you
have to.  I would guess all that would be much less than changing the engine,
and you wouldn't have anywhere near as many headaches.  Try the power first,
you might think it is enough.  Even though I couldn't resist upgrading either
of my 928's for a little more power, clearly there was plenty to begin with.
