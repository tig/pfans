Got it...  my lights throw the correct pattern - higher on rightside - for
US...

also, I put the new jpg on but it pagemill seems to adjust the pic to fill
the page anyways... I liked the 'old' hi-res pic better (but of course
overwrote it already) - DOH!

Let me know what you think...
Phil

> The German authorities require every car to be equipped with a first aid
kit.

kit

> Regarding your headlight lenses: The European H4 lenses create an
asymetric
> area of light in front of the car, that is longer and higher on the left
in
> the UK and longer on the right in the rest of Europe. When travelling
outside
> of the UK, the Brits are required to cover the area of the lens that
creates
> the long range light on the left, because it would blind oncoming
traffic. 
> 
> Why did they design the headlights that way? I know of two reasons: 
> 1. The asymetric lights generally allow for a wider range without
blinding
> oncoming traffic, and allow you to see people walking or objects on the
side
> of the road early.
> 2. Highways and Autobahns in Germany (and probably in most other European
> countries - I just don't remember...) have white plastic markers with
white
> reflectors on each side of the road. With the asymetric light you can see
way
> ahead where the street goes, allowing for safer, faster driving.
> Also: Keep in mind that these lights were introduced at times when the
> Europeans did not have that many multiple lane roads. I have heard, but
from
> my experience don't share concerns about blinding people in their rear
> mirrors when driving offset behind them. 
> 
> How can you tell, which lenses you have? The easiest way is probably to
find
> the wedge shaped area on the lens. Is it on the curb side/right of your
car,
> you have the right lense. Is it on the street side/left, you have UK
lights
> and don't get full benefit of them here in the US.

> P.S. BTW: The Swedish have developped a headlight that includes UV light.
> White objects such as the white road markers or the white hair on dears
legs
> can be seen much earlier, especially in the rain. I don't know if this
kind
> of light ever made it into a production car, though...
