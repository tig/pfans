Hi Porsche people.

I told you guys about my burning 928 s4
At last the repearshop faxed me that they found the (ever lasting)
problem. I found it hard to believe, but what the hell.
they replaced the altenator, he said that some rictifiers where damaged
(4from the 9) and that had damaged the ignition-security modul.
So I was very pleased that he found the problem. 
I started up the car and drove away. 5 minutes later on the freeway
the car started to shake again, and DIED again. Angry as i was i called
the f....ing reapare shop and told them to pick me up (again).

there are 2 sensors in the exhaust pipes (i don't mean the lambda sensor 
in front of the cat.), but the ones right in the front section of the 
exhaust.I know that they have to measure something fore the ignitionoverwach,
but what????????? Can someone tell me something about those sensors?
So guys, my problem with ''loosing power'' is'nt gone.   yet!

so, thanks anyway. 
greetings from holland     aqualux

Stephane, you are right.  the locking mechanism have to come off in 
order to access the door handle assembly.  You first need to remove a 
shield that cover the locking mechanism.  Second, remove a linkage from 
the door latch to the lock mechanism's motorized arm.  There is also a 
linkage from the door handle to the door latch mechanism.

Believe me, you'll appreciate the Porsche over-engineering once you are 
finished... I personally never seen so many moving parts used in a door 
latch before!  Have fun!  :-)
