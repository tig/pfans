Well,a few weeks ago, I discuss that my brake were dragging.  It 
stopped on its own and I still adjusted the pedal a bit looser to 
prevent this from happening again.

Well, Just to make sure, I took it to my mechanics and, of course, the
problem did not reoccur.  They suggested that I bleed my brake a bit
more in case that some debris was causing the problem but, beause the
4 wheels were locking, it was a hard one to diagnose.

When I got home, I notice that the brake were dragging again.  This
time mostly the front one.  I NEED HELP!!!

One thing that I notice is that the vaccum line to the brake booster
has a 4 way connection right next to it.  One of the 4 ways goes
nowhere (ie plugged with a screw... PO strikes again...).  I however
do not think that the vaccum as anything to do with the brake
retracting.

Any comment appreciated, even just to tell me if you feel
any drag from the brake at all when you turn the wheel when the
car is off the ground.

TIA
