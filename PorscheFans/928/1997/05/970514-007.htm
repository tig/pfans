Hi everyone-  I just checked my engine number and saw that it said M28/47. If
Susan's info is correct that means that my car is possibly a GT.  Also, it
does have club 7- spoke wheels.  If anyone can confirm this on their '89 it
would be greatly appreciated.  

          Thanks     -   matt
                               '89 928 __




>Saw your posting on the 928 list...you could indeed have an '89 S4 5 speed.
 The >GT did not come out until mid-model year, so there were some S4 sticks.
 The >definitive way to tell is check your ENGINE number, which is located on
a small >block behind the upper radiator hose.  An S4 will be "M28/41" and a
GT will be >M28/47.
