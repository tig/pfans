|Adam? Are you out there? How about running this query past Kim Crumb when
|you next hear from him? And by the way, I've seen your car on your
|web-site! That is a killer shot of you using it "In anger" so to speak!
|Awesome... totally awesome. Perhaps you should let Phil Tong use that shot
|on his web-site?

Hey, I'm always lurking out here ;-)

Well its not like I'm talking to Kim every week, but next time I give him a
call I'll ask if he has all that information. I don't know if he has put
together information for the ROW models/designations/numbers.

Thanks for the compliment, but which picture? I have some on the website but
there are others that aren't directly mapped to web pages.
If someone wants the addresses they could map the pics to their sites. It just
ins't appropriate to fill our regions web pages with my 928 pics. I will add
them to my home page when I eventually get some time to update it!
