        Hi there Richard, this is James Renfrew of Victoria BC Canada.  I'm
interested in adding just a single turbo to my car.  Did you investigate
this avenue before your desision of the twin turbo?  What type of mods were
done to the mechanics in the motor to allow it to accept the twin turbo's
without engine damage?  Is the car EFI or semi mechanical, or something
else?  Do you feel brave enough to tell me what the setup cost you?  I don't
think I'd be able to swallow both the setup for the twin turbos or the cost
of keeping it in gas after.  Have ever checked out your 0-60 on the car?


                                  I anticipate your response,  James Renfrew

Maybe try a bigger hammer?

Just about every 928 that I've came across have a cracked dash.  I just 
called Just Dashes, Inc. in Van Nuys, CA to get a price quote.  They 
quoted $450 for the dash and $280 for the pod.  This is not just a 
recover; its a total restoration.  According to the person that I've 
spoke to, the color would match but the vinyl grain will not.  Any 
comments or recommendation from other?
