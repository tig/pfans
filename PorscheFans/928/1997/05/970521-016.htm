  Unfortunately they can't do this over the phone for Euro models (WPOZZZ...). 
  Supposedly not in the computer, but I was told I could mail off for the Cardex 
  stuff ($30), and that would list option codes, etc. I doubt it would contain 
  any service history since they advertise this in Panorama as a Birth 
  Certificate for your Porsche.
  
  I would agree that the phone people are friendly and willing to help.

  ask them what the options were.  They could tell me the option numbers, 
  but because of the age of my car, they couldn't correlate those numbers 
  to the actual option.  I was able to find most of them from postings, and 
  Leonard came to the rescue on all but one other.  In fact, yesterday
  I got a letter in the mail from PCNA thanking me for my continued interest 
  in their cars and inviting me to call back with any other questions.  Neat!
  
  You'll need the VIN to get any info over the phone, of course.
