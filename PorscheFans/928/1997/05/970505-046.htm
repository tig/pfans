  Hi Alan, Porsche Fans, my name is James Renfrew, Victoria BC Canada.  By
the sounds of your problem you have a "power loop" problem. This means that
some where in the car there is a circuit that is live from a constant
voltage source and when the master switch is turned off the live circuit
feeds the rest of the electrical in the car to keep it going.  To try to
rectify this I'd first ask myself, have I made any electrical mods in the
last month or so.  I'd start by disconnecting power to these areas by means
of the fuse box.  Then (if not cured), start the car and turn off the
ignition and then turn on the rear defroster and the heater fan and the head
lights, this high current load may blow the fuse that is feeing back into
the car, which will identify the fault pathway(s).  If the car still fails
to shut off then, open your battery compartment and check for any added
wires to the battery terminal, if any found disconect.  Still not fixed,
then start the car turn ignition off, and then while reading your fuse
layout sequentialy remove all nonessential fuses and prey the car shuts off
before you pull out a fuse REQUIRED for the enginge to run.  If the fault
still continues as a last stab you could pull out ALL relays and ALL fuses.
Then check your owners manual and only reinstall nessasary fuses for running
and check vehicle again.

                                                    If all else fails e-mail me!
