Hi Folks,
I noticed in some past postings, there were compliants about the long =
shifter travel in 928's. There was talk of shortening the shift lever =
etc.
Possibly, there is another problem that has been overlooked. The linkage =
has a component called a "shift cup" which is mounted forward on the =
torque tube. This is a plastic pivot which is prone to severe wear and =
just plain degredation. This unit was diagnosed as bad and replaced on =
my 88 S4(45k miles) by "Garth" at Pioneer Porsche in San Diego. NOTE: if =
you place the lever in any gear and there is more than .250 movement of =
the lever, this shift cup is out of spec.
This shortened the throw to total shifter motion of 3 inches. It was 6 =
inches. All "slop" is gone. Recommended replacement procedure is to =
remove torgue tube to get at this unit. However, "Garth" has devised a =
method of removing and reinstalling without torque tube removal. I was =
present while it was being replaced and you must have a lift and some =
special tools not found in the Porsche manuals. (read: home made)
Hope this post is of some help.

Enjoy your ride,=20
