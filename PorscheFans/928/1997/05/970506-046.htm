        Hi there Porsche fans, James Renfrew here, I've just finished
helping out 3 Porsche fans the last day and now I need some aid.  On my 1978
Porsche 928 the car sat for some time, and subsiquently the power feed to
all the left gauges in the cluster is got no power.  I've tested all fuses,
appear OK, tested all gauges OK.  I'd like to know which fuse is responsible
for the power distrobution to the gauges and where the 4th wire from the
left side of the plug that goes into the left hand side of the instraments
goes to, if you follow me. I think the colour is black with a red stripe IF
I recal correctly.
        Another thing I REALLY want to do is install a late model fuse box
in my early car, a late box with the plastic blade style fuses.  What I want
to know is are the plugs for the wires into the box the same?

        One last thing, I have a mint car bra off of an 80's 911.  I would
like to get a desent 928 car bra to fit my 1978.  Does anyone out there have
a 928 bra and could use, or sell a 911 one?  I'm going to post this question
on the 911 page as well.  I don't know enough about 911's to tell which cars
it will fit but I can easly tell it's off of a 911 without the slant nose.
