Just got Colonel Stapp back from the good guys at Franklin Services.  The
fuel leak was, as suggested, a gasket leak between the pump and the tank.
You suspect that you MIGHT have a sharp mechanic when, after describing your
leak, he asks, "Is that at the right rear corner of the tank?  If so, it
could just be the pump gasket.  We've seen that one before."

Thanks to all on the list who suggested solutions!

Got the new (ca. 2k mi. old) timing belt retensioned.  Got the complete
windshield washer systems working (bad pumps, pinched lines).  A/C recharged
(brrrrr!)  Fixed the driver's seat rear height adjustment (oh, joy... or is
is, A} altitude sickness?, or B} concussion from my head hitting the roof?).
Replaced the rusted-out license plate light (ah-HA!  there IS something on a
928 that will rust!)  Money & time mans that the rattle behind the HVAC
panel, the bum water temp guage light & the scored brake rotors (pads still
ok) will wait.

Here's the rub:  The beast will often but not always stall when returning to
idle -- hot or cold; A/C compressor on or off; after cruising or even when
shifting under light load.  The revs will drop down to maybe 400 RPM or less
then either stall or smoothly revert to normal idle.  My mechanic (I'm so
possessive...) says that my idle stabilizer may be sticking.  No big deal,
of course, a $100-$125 Bosh part plus say an hour installation, but I'd
prefer to avoid starting the spiralling random parts replacement plunge that
has been the death of so many 928's and even more owners' spirits.

Comments, suggestions, discussion?  Danke!
