     Hey fellow PorscheFans:
     
     
     A couple of weeks ago I related my story of the flashing brake 
     pressure light and many of you were kind enough to offer advice.  
     Unfortunately, the "disconnect the battery" trick worked for a couple 
     of days the first few times and now the light comes back on as soon as 
     I apply pressure to the brakes.  It looks like it is time to try 
     something more drastic.  Someone mentioned back then that they knew of 
     a way to build a pressure bleeder from common parts for $20 or $30.  I 
     am wondering if whoever it was could either post the instructions or 
     e-mail me directly.  Also, if anyone has any ideas of where a pressure 
     bleeder can be rented that might be helpful as well.  I am in the 
     Washington DC suburbs.  I would be forever indebted as it looks like I 
     am going to have to replace the MC as well as the sensors while I'm in 
     there.  BTW, are pressure bleeders widely used by repair shops or do 
     most of them still use a the con someone into pumping method?  
     
     
        
     Thanks a bunch,
