Brian,

The procedure is very straightforward.  You will need to remove the oil
filter
to get a hold of the sensor.  It has a 20 mm or slightly larger bolt
pattern at the
top for removal.  Just make sure you have a pan under the car as ~ 1 cup
of oil is
held up above the sender.  You might want to (should) replace the
aluminum O-Ring
between the sender and the block.

Good luck,
