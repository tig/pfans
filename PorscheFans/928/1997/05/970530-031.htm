Well, the title does not reflect my situation but being a in Category
2b,
I guess I made the time.

Name: Stephane Chabot (There should be an accent on Stephane but some
unix system
	do not tolerate French characters :-P )
Gender: MALE (Stephane is often confused with Stephanie...)
Age: Will be 30 VERY soon
Status: Maried for 2 years. My wifes name is Holly (This was added to
further clarify
			    my gender ;-)
Profession: Process engineer in a zinc plant
Background: Born in Sherbrooke, Quebec.  French Canadian and proud of
it!!! (However
	    economical pressure led to exodus...)

	    University of Ottawa Graduate in 90 (this is important to qualify
me as 
	    a techno guy...)  Degrees were in Biochemistry and Chemical
Engineering
	    (this qualifies me as resonably paid but will only be able to dream
of 
	     a new WATER COOLED 911)

	    Worked in Timmins Ontario for about 3 years, then moved to the
States,
	    St-Louis area to be precise, As a TEMPORARY ALIEN (I should not get
	    started on the US immigration laws...)  Have been in the area
almost
 	    4 years.

	    Bought an 85 928 S last October and I have been working on it Ever
	    since (mixed feeling on this one) GET YOUR CAR INSPECTED BY A 928
	    PRO BEFORE BUYING!!!.  For the little milage I have put on the car,
	    I simply love it.  I selected the 928 because it is a real GT and
	    can't wait until I can drive it back home (Quebec city) (22 + hours
	    and I know I will be grinning all the way).

	     I always loved Porsches, especially the 911 Turbo (don't shoot
me).
	    Never driven one and with my 928, I don't know if I still want
one...

	    Wish in life: Get a job that allow me to drive my 928 to it
(industrial
            environment does not agree with car paint...).  Next best
thing: Get
	    a 944 S or 951 as a daily driver/junker which I would not care if
the
	    paint get recked...

	    Hopefully, I will get to try the new racetrack in St-Louis this
fall
	    with the 928 in the PCA event.  This is a long shot due to cash
flow
	    limitation and the INSPECTION THING!!  Next year, I WILL be there!!
	    	
	    Compiler of 928 FAQ.  Please help on this one.  I compile the
information,
	    and have the knoledge to write only so much.  Don't forget, I am
the
	    one that ASSUME many many things and needs to be pointed in the
right
	    direction.

Well, enough of the chit chat.  I have 4 calipers that needs rebuilding
and
brake hoses to test.  The jury is still out on taking the master
cylinder
apart...
