Thanks to all of you who responded to my plea for help.  It's nice to know
that there are so many people out there who love these cars as much as I do.
 It was James "I have way too many neat cars" Renfrew's advice that allowed
me to solve the problem.  It turns out that there was an aftermarket wire
leading from a non essential fuse to who knows where that was causing a power
loop problem.  Once disconnected, problem gone.  I still don't know what that
wire is was placed there for (aftermarket alarm?) or where it goes, but for
now, who cares!!  James saved me and my car a trip to the Porsche dealer-
Three cheers for James!
