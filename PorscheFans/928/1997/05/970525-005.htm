I'll assume you don't live in California - no way a mechanic here would =
recommend disconnect of the air pump.  Smog inspectors in this state are =
getting very serious enforcing the new, tougher regs, and will fail you =
during the initial *visual* inspection.  You'll never even get the wand =
in your tailpipe.  Instant failure, and thanks for the 50 bucks. =20

The pump provides direct injection into the converter to aid in the =
oxidation process of excess CO and HC.  It injects downstream of the =
lambda sensor, so shouldn't have any impact on the car's mixture (hence =
performance), and the pump consumes a small amount of horsepower.  The =
only change you'll see is a huge increase in emissions from your =
tailpipe.

I don't understand your mechanic's assertion of "performance gains".
