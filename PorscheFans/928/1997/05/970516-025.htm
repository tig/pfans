Hi everyone- I agian have a coolent problem.  I had a water hose replaced
last week and the hole system was pressurized and there wasen't any problems.
But this morning, most of my coolent had drained out. I refilled it up and
its been ok for now. I will have to see if it drains out agian and where. I
fear that it is the radiator... does anybody know the procedure for changing
one or hass anybody replaced one before?
I might replace all the hoses first and see what happens. How long do
radiators last?? How many miles under average use??  I have had the car since
Sept. and have replaced the water pump already and the lower radiator hose.
Thanks for any help in advance.
