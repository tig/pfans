Hello!

Today was a good day.  All of my ducks finally lined up in a row, and I
will be taking delivery of an '89 928S4 (guards red with black
leather..I know its really cliched, but it is the best one I found in
quite an exhaustive search...)

It is perfect.  And fast.  But you all knew that.  And it gets AWFUL gas
mileage.  Truly awful.  My previous porsche 944S got upwards of 30mpg on
the highway and had the best steering around, but you can't argue with
the Torque God.

I have graduated from the 924-944 list (although someday I want another
one... ) to this, the flagship list of all Porsche lists (cars should be
watercooled...) and I have all of you to thank for it.  Your advice was
invaluable in the selection of my new beast (it really is a big car,
huh?)  I hope not to have any problems to bother the list with, but I am
sure you will be hearing from me.  Thanks again.
