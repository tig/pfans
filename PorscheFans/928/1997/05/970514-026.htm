	Well, let's see, thats three convertibles, a spercharged 928, a callaway twin 
turbo, two S-4 trucks, and two six liter monsters. And thats just the people 
that found this list, I wonder what else lurks out there? Geez, I thought my 
rear wiper delete was cool. I wonder if anyone has ever
used a 928 power plant in another car? What ever happened to that kit-car 
roadster body for the 928?
Is there a website where I can see these trucks?
