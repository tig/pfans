Actually I already removed the door panel, in hopes of finding
an unplugged connector between the lock and the door hinge.
There is a connector in there, but it wasn't the problem.
Unfortunately the lock is in a position that is pretty well
blocked off by the sheet metal and the electric motor, so I
can't quite see what's hanging things up.

I suppose the plastic sheeting is there for a good purpose - it
would help keep the inner panel from wetness brought down by
the windows. Anyway mine was pretty much intact, although the
glue that holds it in place wasn't.
