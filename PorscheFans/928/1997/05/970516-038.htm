Yup. It's me.  The best method is to go to your local Porsche dealer 
and ask their mechanic about the Tech Bulletin.  What parts are needed 
and order it.  If you want the Tech Bulletin yourself, MY PORSCHE sells 
them.  They go by the year and cost about $30-50 (?) per year.  They 
have a web site.  Sorry, don't have their address.  Maybe other can 
post?  The window rattling is definitely a nuisance.  I plan to fix it, 
but its low on my priority list.
