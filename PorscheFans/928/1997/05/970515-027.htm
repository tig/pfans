Actually, just two. A vast amount of information about VIN,engine numbers,
and engine and transmission configurations and the models and model years
to which they apply can be found in the Porsche spec book, along with gobs
of stuff about fastener torques, wheel and tire specs, and repair of all
major subsystems of the car.

Since so many on the list have questions along these lines, I really don't
understand why everyone doesn't plunk $8.55 (current price from My Porsche;
http://www.my-porsche.com/link2.htm#tech) and get the one which includes
his or her car.

The other "key" I use is a copy of the PCNA "Fact Book" which I was given
by a friendly dealer. This is a cute little book with all sorts of info of
the sort needed by a salesperson to describe the current new cars and,
relevant to this discussion, to decode the M codes in order to determine
the exact state of equipment of a used car (e.g., presented as a trade-in).
This also has tables of models and basic characteristics per year, which I
take as a guide to what PCNA imported.

I think I've seen these Fact Books advertised in the back of Panorama or
Excellence, but can't locate such an ad just now.
