     Sean:
     
     You asked if anyone knew of a good place for a wheel alignment in the 
     DC area.  After making the mistake of taking my '82 to a tire chain 
     for alignment, I ended up taking it to Tischer Porsche on Rt. 29 
     (Automobile Blvd.) in Silver Spring - a bit of a haul for you.  They 
     did a very good job, but it wasn't cheap - $125 for a four wheel 
     alignment (The dealer in Rockville wanted $180!!).  While it sounds 
     like hype, my manual says that there is a special alignment tool that 
     Porsche makes and my guess is that without this tool the tire shop had 
     to eyeball the on center position for the front.  After two tries (the 
     second was free) I gave up and took it to Tischer.  By the way, while 
     I was there I took the opportunity to test drive a '92 BMW 325i.  Made 
     me realize how good my 15 year old Porsche handles.  Are you sure you 
     want to trade a Porsche for a mere Lotus?  Ah, you'll be back...
