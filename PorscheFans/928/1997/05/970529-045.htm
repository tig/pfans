   I haven't seen any aftermarket rear bars advertised, so you're probably
   stuck with a stock bar.  Used should be ok if you can find one.
   
   I'm curious about how a tow could have bent the bar in the first place
   since it is above the transaxle.  Are you sure the drop links (@ $50) 
   aren't just broken or bent?  I've had one of those break on my car before.
   As a former tow truck driver (during my college years), this just
   reinforces my opinion that tow trucks are on their way out and flatbeds
   are the wave of the future!
   
   BTW, Weltmiester and Devek sell beefier front bars for the 928.
   
   P.S. You do have the tow hook that came in the toolkit, right?

I think it might be the drop link.  Is it the straight long pole that runs
from near the right tire?  The tow was a flat bed and the hooks that secure
it on thee bed were pulled to tight and bent it.Thanks.
