To all those technically minded out there:

My 84 Euro spec has had an intermitant tach problem from the day I
bought it.  The tach only works during the winter, and it barely rises
when the car is at an idle.  I assumed that the cold ambient temperature
affects the electrical connections, so I took the pod off and cleaned
all of the contacts on the printer circut board.  It did not work. Three
times it did not work.  I was hoping that I may have been able to fix
the gas gauge (doesn't work at all) and the volt meter (swings up and
down, but the Radio Shak volt meter stays steady).  Has any had any luck
with repair places like North Hollywood Speedometer, who suggests that I
sent the whole pod and have them repair, clean, and calibrate all the
gauges. If anyone has had this done, did it work and how much did it
cost?
