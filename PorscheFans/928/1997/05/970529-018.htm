>Hmm.  On my car ('84) the air pump pipe goes to the cat.

Correct!! I should have clarified, my cars are NON CAT cars and it goes into
the head in these, in CAT cars it goes directly into the exhaust system.
Even in these I reckon there are better ways of getting more brutality out
of your car.

>Any substantiating proof?  

Well this is from the workshop manual and they say there that it is the Club
sport version engines of type M28/41 with a suffix of SP at the end, These
have the same camshafts (although with different part No.s) as the GT model
also they have modified EZK and LH control units, exhaust system, lighter
Airco. comp. etc. sounds the same as a GT to me. (A rose by any other
name...perhaps?)
