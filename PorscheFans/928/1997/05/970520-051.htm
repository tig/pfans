Hi Everyone,

Just got back from a business trip to the SF Bay area.  While there I
dropped by to see Susan and Marc at Devek Performance.  Even though they
were tired from a weekend of racing and probably need some well earned
rest they dropped everything and spent at least 2 hours with me.  I was
very impressed with their operation.  All of use that are dedicated to
the 928 should be thankful that we have folks like Marc and Susan to
help when we need a part or just information.  Let us all support Devek
by buying our much needed parts (and GREAT Devek Tee Shirts) from them.

It is my opinion that we cannot get along without the great people like
Susan and Marc so let us ALL support this dedicated team and buy our
goodies from them.  Thanks again Devek for the great hospitality.

Thanks,

Don Vellenga

ps.  Hay Phil be sure to show up next time!  I left pictures with Marc.
