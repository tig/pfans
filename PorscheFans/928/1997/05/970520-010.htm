To all dutch Pfans,

I just got pretty p'ed off by my local Porsche dealer (Hoogenboom -
Rotterdam).
Untill recently I never had any problems with 'em, but I just got my car
(911 carrera coupe 3.2 1987) back from a check-up and I'm not quite
satisfied.
I think the engine isn't running that great (it's not really bad, but it's
been better), while they keep saying there's nothing wrong. I'm sure
there's nothing really wrong, but like I said, it's been running better,
and I want 'em to fix it! Guess not, cause they say they can't get it any
better.
Untill recently I was always sure to take my car to an official
Porsche-shop, but I'm having serious doubts now. I don't mind them charging
astronomical amounts for their services (well...), just as long they
deliver a perfect job, which they now just didn't!
Anyway, to cut a long boring story short, does any of you dutchies out
there know of a decent mechanic, who's used to working on Porsches, and who
loves just as much to work on it as I love to drive it. Preferably
somewhere near Rotterdam (I'm from Hellevoetsluis my self).

Any suggestions are welcome...
TIA

Jeroen Berloth
