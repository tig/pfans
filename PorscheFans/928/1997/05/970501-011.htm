I went to Jim Ellis in Atlanta and they said a new key would be $47.00,
which I think is the most ridiculous thing I've EVER heard, so I'm curious
how much it was through 928 International.

My '83 928S has 198K on the odo and I have yet to touch the engine's 
internals.  (knock on wood...)  I religiously change oil at 3k. 

>2. Can anyone offer me a copy of the December 96 (?) Excelence article

Sure.  email me your address and I'll make you a copy of the article 
for free.  (Sorry folks, I extend this offer only to Steven...)

>3. There is tons of info on 911's, some of which I have read. Is there

There are some technical review/articles/books about the 928s. Look at 
the ads in the back of a Excellence Magazine.
