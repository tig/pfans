Speaking of Christmas tree lighting I recently had the displeasure of seeing
a 928 which had been "customized" by it's caring owner by drilling millions of 
holes in the "PORSCHE" logo on the rear end of the car into which he stuck
millions
of red L.E.D.s and connecting them up to the brakelights.

FRIGHTENING!!

Do you stateside guys have to put your cars through an anual technical control ?
