Greetings,

This weekend I experienced some new fun with my '89 928 S4. 
I was happily cruising a 50 mile jaunt on the freeway, no traffic jams,
the day was going well =) Or so I thought...


At the third red light I hit the car began to idle funny, rough,
lower than usual. I applied the throttle to reduce the vibration.

I made it through the light (barely) the car seem to have NO power, I had
to use excessive gas, and it was extremely slow. My immediate thought was
a bad plug, or wire, or the like. 

When I pulled over and shut the car down, I checked all the wire, started
it back up, and every thing seemed fine. I almost made it to my
destination 2 blocks away before it started acting funny again. That was
Saturday.... Today it acted similarly, its fine until it warms up, then
the power disappears. VERY strnage. Tonight I drove home with my fingers
crossed. No problems for 55 miles, no problems getting off the freeway.
Of course the night air is a few degrees cooler.


Anyone have any ideas where to start looking?

It seems temperature sensitive, and maybe RPM dependant, or speed
dependant, or stop/start sensitive (it didn't happen on the freeway
Saturday when it was HOT)...


Thanks,

Lance
