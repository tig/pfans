Though there's nothing wrong with using OEM especially with Porsche,
there's nothing wrong with applying aftermarket upgrades as well.  I went
with red 8.5mm Magnecor race wires for $104 ('84 928 S).  They came
pre-cut, completely assembled with boots and feature EMI supression as
well.  Beautiful wires.

This is in direct contrast to what I tried first - a generic roll your ow=

kit from Accel.  Now, I'm not knocking them but I had a hell of time with
their cheap boots, not to mention my lack of a plugwire crimptool.  I end=
ed
up frustrated and threw them into the garbage.  This product is admitedly
at the bottom of their line-up (and a landfill by now).

There are lots of other similar roll your own type of kits, in at least a=
s
many colors and types of wires.  You got a race shop closeby?

Someone was asking for a picture of how Porsche routed the stock plugwire=
s
in case there's a method to their madness (reduced chance of cross-fire /
cross-pulsing, etc.)  (also maybe for authenticity's sake as there are
numerous wire separators to put on/back).

Then again you'd have to be sure your wiring / separators are original to
begin with..

Have fun and welcome to the best list on the 'net (with the best cars on
earth)
