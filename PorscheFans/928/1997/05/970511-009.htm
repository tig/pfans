Matt, lucky isn't the word... but I am glad no hurt was done.

Does your coolant level gauge work??  there is suppose to be
a float in the expansion tank that indicate if the coolant is low.

If you did not see a light in your dash, you might want to check the
system out...  You might only be lucky once.

PS.  My PO actually just cut the wire to that float...  I would like
to meet the guy and here is philosophy about car repair...
