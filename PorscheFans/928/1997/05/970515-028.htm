Leaving aside the issue of stick v. auto (yes, I know it was the subject of
your note, but this is my reply), you're absolutely right on with this.

Even leaving aside the issue of a driver's ability to master driving at
160+ mph (which, by the way, this car makes pretty much a piece of cake, at
least relatively; hmm, what's relative cake?), the car's too competent to
scare or thrill at speeds that most would dare to apply to the Amurrican
road (100+ mph = felony in CA, for example), and those are the results that
most people appear to want from sports cars. 

Add that to an almost non-existent marketing effort from PCNA (to the point
where someone told me the other day that he'd always thought of 928s as
cars for "the doctor's wife", in the manner of M-B SLs) and you get the
other major component of car desirability, cachet with one's peer group and
family.

Oh, well, less expensive purchases for us.
