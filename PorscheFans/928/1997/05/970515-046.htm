Two questions, please. Someone (I think it was Vince) made a comment about
a possible factory tech bulletin about windows -- something about stopping
them from rattling. My driver's side window rattles (loudest upon closing
the door) when the window is partially opened (or partially closed; depends
if you're an optimist or a pessimist) but does not rattle when fully open
or fully closed. Is this the problem that the tech bulletin talks about,
and how do I find out more?

Second: Lately a problem has started up. Car starts fine cold, warm, all
conditions. Idle is smooth. However, if car is cold and I happen to let the
clutch out a little too fast pulling out of the garage (garage has a little
"lip" on it) and I kill the engine, engine does not re-start well. It will
run only as long as I keep the RPMs above 1500 but dies if I get off the
gas. Car must be egged on very tenderly for about a half-mile and then it's
fine again.

Any ideas? Could it somehow be related to the fact that my cruise just up
and quit last week?
