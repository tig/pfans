Sam,

A PO put the wrong battery in mine and got it to stay in place with a
piece of grease stained 2x4.  This past Sat I spent 45 min at the local
foreign parts store trying to find a battery that's the right size. 
They were quoting between $70 and $90.  Today, I'll pick one up at the
dealer that I know will work for ~$95 with PCA discount.  Unless someone
else knows of a way to get a Douglas battery cheaply, you might want to
save some time going to your dealer.

YMMV,
Kurt
87 S4 5sp (It's on the road now!  In the past few weeks, pilot bearing,
O2 sensor, rear wheel bearing, e-brake, steering rack, Koni Reds and
Weltmeister springs, BFG R1's, seat switches, belts and cam cover
gaskets.  Whew.)
