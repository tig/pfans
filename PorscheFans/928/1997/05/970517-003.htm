Hi 928 Fans!  I'm both new to the list as well as a new owner of a 928.
Just bought an '87 928S4 - Black/Grey leather.  The car is a real
"killer" to drive.  It's unlike any car I've driven before.  I think
Porsche broke the mold when they made this one!

In addition to the 928, I have a restored '78 Land Cruiser and have done
a fair amount of off road driving.  While doing so, i learned about a
product called Oil Energizer.  It is made by the same folks that make
Rain-X.....the window "stuff."  You add it to your oil when you do your
oil change.  It decreases the friction of the oil.  It (the oil)
becomes  slipperier.  The product works - better than Slik 50 and most
other similar products.  It virtually eliminates dry starts.  Engine
wear is decreased. You get a small HP boost as well as a slight increase
in MPG.  It will work with the Porsche engine as well as with regular
oil or synthetic oil.  You can't buy it in the store (the only
drawback).  You have to call the Rain-X  people in Tuscon.  Give it a
try - keep those 928's running forever!
