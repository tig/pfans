Several years ago the Porsche dealer swore my tube bearings were going out,
same symptoms.  When they dug into it they found it was the main input
bearing in the tranny... the tube was OK.

In anticipation I had bought a rebuilt tube from 928 International for about
half the price of a new one.  Had to return it and pay a restocking fee.

Good luck.

Sure.  Just be aware that you need to do ALOT of rewiring.  Mostly has 
to do with the engine management system given the year, etc... IMHO, 
not worth the effort.  Tell your friend to start saving and buy the 
year/model that will satisfy his power urges instead.

I'm an ex-subscriber.  That's one of my main gripe.  What good is a 
magazine to me if they cannot just at least have a blurp on a 
water-cool once a month?  Even a paragraph or two will satisfiy me!
But, Noooooooo!  Once in a blue moon, I get this postcard to entice me 
to renew.  Bunk!

Now, if we can get together and start a 928 newsletter... How 'bout it 
boys and girls?

Stephane,  I repacked my bearing once but cannot comment on the race 
removal since mine is in good shape.  I just used a brand name 
high-temp bearing grease from your local auto supply house.  All I can 
say is that you do not want to over-pack.  In hot temp, the grease will 
release gas and if over-packed, the gas will blow out seals.  Also, I 
can almost guarantee you that after the repack and adjustment, you'll 
need a wheel alignment.
