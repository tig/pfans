Hi,

I'm new to this list and I have a couple of dumb questions:

I'm in the process of importing a 928S from Japan to Canada.  According to
Canadian customs I have to prove that the vehicle is 15 years old (1982) or
older.  My Porsche has the date 20.5.82 stamped on the seat belts.  Is this
the official manufacture date of the car, or merely the manufacture date of
the seat belts?  I thought that the date would be stamped on the body of the
vehicle...

The Chassis code is WPOZZZ92ZDS841662 does this corespond with the 1982
manufacture date?

I need to know the exact month of manufacture as well, as Canadian Customs
won't allow the vehicle in if it is a few months shy of  15 years old.

I will also need offical documentation regarding manufacture date to present
Customs, so does anyone know how to go about getting it.  Do I have to write
away to Porsche?

If you can give me any information regarding this, it would be GREATLY
appreciated!

Thanks very much,

Jake Keel
