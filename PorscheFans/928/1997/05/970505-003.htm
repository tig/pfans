Hello,
	I must first say thanks again to all who provided me with info on my 
'80 928S (Euro).  I have decided that I am an air-cooled fan only.  I 
think that the 928 is an incredible car, but it is like owning a 
Lamborghini.  There is just too much there for me to handle.  I am used 
to a 1 hour engine swap. The 928 is mechanically intimidating.  So, I am 
offering mine for sale for $5750.  Obviously for the price it is not 
pristine. It could use a new interior (ugly & dated), also first and 
second sybchros are a little shady.  The car does, however, look and 
drive great!  I just paid over $7.5k for the car and have put $630 in 
it.  I just need back in an old 911.  Anyone interested can contact me, 
Cameron, at (615) 360-7626.

P.S., Sorry about the useage of the group, but the car has to go.
