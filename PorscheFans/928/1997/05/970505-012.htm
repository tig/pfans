        I was reading threw my 1980 928 manual and noticed a talk about the
cooling system, it said when draining the coolant to remove the plug at the
bottom of the rad, and THEN it also sai to take out the plugs on the side of
the engine block to drain the galleries in the block.  This reminded me to
the post that mryan019@juno.com wrote, which made me think that if it's not
any thing to do with the resivoir he might also check the rubber seal(s) on
the gallery plugs.

The hatch lock is straight forward.  The door lock, you need to remove 
all panels to access the electrical connector to the alarm system.  
Then you need to disengage a linkage that goes from the cylinder arm 
lever to the door latch.  Remove a bolt that secure the cylinder from 


the side; located a few inches directly on top of the door latch.  Pull 
the cylinder out along with the electrical wiring.
