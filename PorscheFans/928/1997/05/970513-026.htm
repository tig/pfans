I'd just like to add my 2 cents to the discussion about manual gearbox
versus Auto.   The Auto is of course great if you want to do long high speed
trips or if you do a lot of city driving and dont want to end up with thigh
muscles like Rambo from the heavy clutch BUT if you do a lot of open road
driving on twisty winding roads then I think the manual is unbeatable. Now
dont get me wrong folks I'm not saying that it'll go around a corner faster
or anything or get away from the lights quicker but I reckon that all round
its just a teenchy weenchy little bit more fun. I've got an '84 s2 auto and
and an 87 s4 manual, I had the auto first and bought the manual later and I
think that if your first Porsche IS to be a 928 it may be a better option to
go for an Auto as you will have more time to enjoy the pleasure of driving
the thing rather than trying to keep track of exactly what gear your in.
(picture this: Slam the lever into what you think is first let out the
clutch and to your great surprise find that you're travelling down the
street at 50mph in REVERSE AARRGGHHH/ or into the car behind maybe)
No I did'nt!! 
A clutch is a little expensive but is no bother to DIY, the torque convertor
is as expensive and is a nightmare to DIY, there's a lot fewer little fiddly
bits in a manual than in the auto to go wrong and remember autos go wrong too!!

You may take care of it but who's to say the last guy did!
