Vince: For what it's worth, both my oil pressure and fuel gauges are off 
calibration. My oil gauge jumps to 1 bar as soon as the ignition is turned 
on, and pegs when the engine starts (which I expect). Once the engine is 
warmed up, the oil pressure runs about 3.5 bar at idle (which I interpret 
as 2.5 bar, which again seems OK). Above 1500 RPM the pressure is pegged.

Fuel gauge is just the opposite... when full, the needle is still just shy 
of the top mark. The gauge drops appropriately but the needle buries itself 
before the low-fuel light comes on.

I attribute both of these to electrical gremlins which I've just not had 
the time to get to. Since I'm driving the car every day right now, I'm 
holding off on some fun repairs until I can get the quality time with the 
car. When I figger out what's happened, I'll post it to the group.

Pete
