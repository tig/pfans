Actually, quite a lot. Calm down, Brian. What I sent you was intended as a
little politically-incorrect humor. When I have used cruise control, or
just acknowledged the obvious (e.g., a patrol car every mile or so along
I-95 through northern Maryland) and put it in fifth and relaxed, I've seen
about 20 mpg myself. I just hate to drive that way.

Clearly not a good place to play!

I'll play old fart long enough to wax nostalgic for the days before point
systems and reciprocal arrangements among states. No one today has the
means you refer to; the system is just too tough.

Great!

Sad, isn't it? On the Autobahn, you'd be pushed out of the way if you were
going 100 mph in the left lane.

At any rate, I apologize for riling you. You can get something resembling
decent fuel economy from a 928, but it's more fun when you don't.
