Thanks for the kind words - I don't want to get flamed like Jay on the
other list (which I have to say wasn't entirely fair to Jay as I've enjoyed

Lucky has another commitment ahead of me that's taking longer than
expected.  We are now looking at a first-week-of-June delivery date...  I
stare at these pictures daily and once the webpage is up, we'll all be able
to stare at each others cars too :)
