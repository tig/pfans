Martin,
	Are your front side marker lights aft of the front wheels? Is your rear
bumper cover smooth (no little "bumperettes" on either side of the license
plate)? Are the idiot lights on the console in German (Bremsflusslicht,
Bremslicht, etc)? Is the speedo in kilometers? Do you have a red lens about
four inches square just left of the rear license plate which is controlled
by a second fog light switch below the usual one on the left side of the
instrument pod? You apparenly have the adjustable headlights - are they
great, huge lenses without chrome trim rings? Do all four rectangular
lights up front have halogen bulbs, and the outer ones have additional
small incandescent ones for parking lights?

These are some of the things that would differentiate a Euro from a US spec
car. Did you say it was a '78? Mine is too, and as far as I know the rear
wing was not available until <'80?> (help me out here guys...) when the
928S was introduced. (curiously, mine has had the wing added as well...)

I'm not positive what the HP difference is - I've heard conflicting figures
ranging from 240 to 260. Either way, it's something more than the US's 219
- so let's try and "stick it to them" (US spec owners) a little ;)

I have completley stripped, cleaned, repaired, and re-installed my entire
interior over the winter months. I'm no expert, but I may be able to add
some value to your experience on occasion - keep in touch.
