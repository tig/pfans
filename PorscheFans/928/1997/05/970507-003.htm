That's credentials enough - you are a 928 fan, car not required...

If you use a 'touchless' car wash you don't have to remove a thing.  The
car gets washed & dried pretty much by hand, the 'car wash' part only seems
to spray/rinse and there's nothing that touches the car ever except for the
tracks for the tires...

Now the bad part is the condition and type of rags these places use!
