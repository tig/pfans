Dear 928ers, 
 
When I purchased my 928 s4 five months ago, it had a little bit of an
oil leak from the valve cover gaskets.  I had it taken care of for
around $500.  
 
Now, 5k miles later, it appears that I have a minor leak from the same
gaskets that were replaced.  A Porsche mechanic (sounds like a pretty
competent guy too) tells me it's a design flaw and if I get it fixed
(which I plan to anyway) it'll probably start again later. 
 
This sounds really fishy to me.  Do any of you know about this?? 

Phil T - right back at you on the "thanks for the emails."  

In reply, my 88 928S4 is "silber metallic," auto, bgndy leather, 78k
miles, very stock, soon to have Blaup. CD.  I live in Indianapolis, IN
and no there really aren't too many 928s around at all.  In fact, since
I bought mine I've run into only two others on the street.  A preS4 and
an 89S4 (150k miles but really beautiful).  Also, in case you know of
anyone looking for a 928, I am thinking of selling mine if I can get
$17k for it.  (I bought it for 16k 12/96, but I've put much more than
$1k on it).  Don't get me wrong ... I LOVE THE CAR.  It's just that I've
always hoped to have a Ferrari one day ... and today kind of feels like
that day.  If I can sell the 928, I'm planning to go for a really early
model 308 (I know, very impractical).  But if I don't sell it, I'm still
an awfully happy 928 owner.
 
Thanks and sorry about the wordiness.. 
Sohail (or Cy, which most people find easier)
