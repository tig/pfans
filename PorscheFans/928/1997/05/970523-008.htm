Hey everyone.  I have a couple of quick questions.  I have a black 1987 928S4
that I have done a few mods to, and I wanted to ask a couple of questions
before I do any more.  my car has 17" Speedline C2 Turbo rims and I was
curious if there was enough clearance left in the rear to lower the car 1 to
1.5 inches.  Also, I'm wanting to upgrade the brakes, but don't just want to
put the GTS kit on the car- I'd prefer to have the brakes from the 1996/7 911
Bi-Turbo, or at least vented rotors of the approximate same size.  Anyone
have any ideas or places to call?  Devek hasn't been much help, and I don't
want to just put vented rotors on the front of the car.  Any ideas?  Thanks
in advance!

P.S. I have scans of the 928 and Lotus if ayone os interested.
