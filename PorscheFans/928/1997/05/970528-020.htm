Hey guys, I don't think I've posted in about 6 months- it was a rough last
semester.  But, I've graduated and am *only* working full time instead of
30 hours a week plus classes!  Anyway, as much as I love my 928, it's time
to move on to something a little more everyday-driveable.  What could that
be?  Well, after weighing all of my wants and needs I've decided on a 1991
Lotus Elan.  What?!!?!!!  A Lotus for everyday driving!?  Yes, I know it
sounds crazy, but remember that its engine is by Isuzu (tweeked by Lotus)
and I'm tired of trying to navigate the city streets in my big ol' 928.
Don't get me wrong, I *love* my 928.  I will buy another one when I can
afford a place with more than one parking space...  But, for now I am going
to fix all of the little things before I put it up for sale-

So, here's my question:

Does anyone know where I can get a *good* four wheel alignment done in the
Washington, DC metro area?  I've called around and none of my usual mechanics
have the right equipment.  Remember that tech column I posted for you guys
about the correct alignment numbers for 928's (especially euro 928's)?
Here's the address, in case you wanted to see it again:

Well, when I ask the shops if they can get my car to these specs, they've all
said no!  I guess a special machine is needed?...

Hope you all can help!

Sean '80 Euro 928
