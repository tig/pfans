I was reading through some old posts and saw the following:

>>By the way, does anybody have any suggestions for getting the >>windshield washers to work.  My headlight washer works but, the front >>and rear windshield washers do not spray.  I have not investigated >>this problem very far yet so any and all suggestions are sought.

Chris, if you are still around and wondering, I recently had fixed a
similar problem.  My washer reservoir wouldn't hold fluid.  Problem was
worn/rotted hose.  However, after hose replacement, washer still
wouldn't wash.  Ther are several check valves in the washer system that
get stuck/clogged and two of mine had to be replaced before I could get
clean winshield.  BTW, washer, pump and hose is under the plastic splash
shield, in the rear of the front right fender behind the wheel.  WHEW!
