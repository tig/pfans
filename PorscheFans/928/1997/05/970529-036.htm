I was just reading some old unread mail and I noted that
back on May 1, Phil asked:

>>Hey NorCal 928'rs and 'team microbrew':
>>How about some SHOW to balance all that GO  :)  
>>Anyone up for the Wash 'n Shine Sunday May 25th in Danville, CA?  

Well, its past now, but I can report that I entered the Wash 'n Shine
held on May 25 in Danville.  Mine was the only 928 entered. 
Unfortunately, 928's were put in the 'Water-pumper' class along with
924, 944 and yes... Boxster.  Place winners included two Boxsters less
than 2 months old and one VERY nice 944 cab.  I earned 101 out of a
possible 109 points.  I lost points for dirt under door jamb, a rock
chip in the windshield, small stone pits on mirror backs, bumper and
hood and the airline ticket stub my wife left in the hidden door
pocket.  

However, Jim Pascha (Excellence columnist) was one of my judges and I
learned a lot about concours preperation from his interesting running
commentary as he went over my car.

I do plan to attend the Swap meet hosted by PCA-GGR at Automotion in
Sunnyvale on June 8, but I am not brave enough to enter my car in the
Concours.  There will be a similar swap event at Partsheaven in Hayward
on June 29 and again at Carsen Porsche in Palo Alto on August 3.
