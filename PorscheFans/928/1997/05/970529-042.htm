The Club Sport was rated by Porsche as having the same output of the S4
although at a different rpm....  It was breathed on for more sporting
driving, and the press did doubt the quoted figures as being
conservative...  The problem is that there are probably Zero 928 CS's in
the US...  BUT there are many true GT's!

Great post though - you are truly a 928 fan!
