The auto trans in the 928S-4 is a 4speed Mecedes Benz transmission. It has
been the workhorse of the MB family, being used in the V-8 560SEL, and later
version 500SEL's and S500's. It very stout, and very durable. It is not
uncommon for these transmissions to go 200,000 miles before any work needs to
be done, providing they are serviced every 30Kmiles.

I personally (don't throw eggs guys) wouldn't have a 5-speed, as I've driven
both and for me, I'm a Haul-A_S, grand touring kind of guy, and the auto does
everything great. Mercedes was smart in that there is a modulator control on
the side of the trans.(most people don't know about this) where you can
quicken or slow down the shifting speed between gears. I also don't care for
the idea of a clutch, pressure plate, throwout bearing, etc.and LABOR to do a
clutch job on a 928 (oh, I'm going to catch hell on this from the 5spd'ers).
But YES, absolutely the automatic. Road and Track talked about the Mercedes
autobox in a issue yearsago - they too said "get the automatic, it's
virtually bulletproof".\\Hope this helps.
