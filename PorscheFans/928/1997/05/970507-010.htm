Hi Debra:

This is a good argument for not letting anyone hack into the stock wiring
harness, save for the most basic triggers ie. dome light.  We have a hard
enough time just imagine a non 928-savvy installer, I don't care where
he/she got certified!

Hows the car running otherwise haven't heard from you for awhile!
Phil
