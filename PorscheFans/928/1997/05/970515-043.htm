Hi 928 fanatics!

I am new to this list and have a couple of questions that have some degree of
urgency.  (Very cool list, by the way!)

I bought this awesome machine a couple of years ago (17,000 mi) and was
cautioned by a friend that the timing belt was nearly 10 years old and should
be replaced.  O.K. The mechanic that was recommended to me looked things over
and basically said (with his convincing German accent) "Naw, we do not need
to worry about that right now."    Kinda made me nervous, but I was certainly
no expert.  With every subsequent service I asked about having the
timing-belt/water pump replacement done and got a similar response.   (More
nervous)
I found another shop ad had it done with my 30,000 mi service.  Great!  Now I
can drive with no worries.  
Problem:  timing belt tension light started coming on periodically during
high revs.  I called the shop and they said "Don't worry - these have
auto-tensioning and the sensor must be erratic: a common problem."  

Q1:  Should my timing belt light ever come on?  Does the belt require
re-tensioning after installation?

Q2:  I apparently am having problems finding a reputable/reliable 928 shop.
Does anybody have any shop recommendations for the San Jose CA area?

Please help.  I'm getting very nervous again.   :-|
Thanks
