>>Well, David. Now that you mention it, the $47 was for a key with a

Yeah, the $25 seemed to be the standard price, a few years ago at least.

They can be mechanically cut - I watched the guy make mine - but it
takes a special cutter that operates at an angle. Looks like there
must be two sets of pins in the tumbler, mounted at 90 degrees to
each other. Must make it harder to pick the lock and/or duplicate
the key. It _is_ excessive, but then so are a lot of things about
the 928, right?
