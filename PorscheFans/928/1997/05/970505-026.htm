The guy who rebuilt my transmission, and who does 928 technical
sessions for the NER of the PCA, puts synthetic lube in there.
My memory is that it was Valvoline, but I could easily be
convinced otherwise. I had previously changed from dinosaur
oil to Redline, which greatly improved the shifting in cold
weather. The thing that precipitated the rebuild was a failed
input bearing, which I don't think had anything to do with
the choice of lubricant. It sounded like a rock crusher by
the time I had it repaired. As long as it's 75W-90, GL5 spec.,
or whatever it is Porsche calls for, it should be OK to use
synthetic.
