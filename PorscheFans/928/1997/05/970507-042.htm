        To repair your dash there are kits out there for reapiring vinal on
seats and ect.  This kit can be used on the dash as well.  It mends up to a
3/4" hole and is transparent, and DOES match the grains on the dash board.
The only thing that would cause dificulty is that it is transparent, so
you'd have to paint the dash top.

        I have been watching the comments about the oil pressure gauges, and
have been wondering if any of you have considered this.  The 5 bars of
preasure is only around 70 PSI.  And almost any good engined german car
SHOULD read 5 bars when the car is moving and should NOT read less that 1.8
bars to be healthy.  To all out there I would not be concerned it the car
read bar 5 all the time when your driving, I've NEVER heard any failiures
due to over pressure in the 928's or any other car that the oil gauge
responds in this method, being read in Bars and is pinned upon reving over idle.

so I hear I've been dubbed by fellow Porsche Fans!!
