Not laser cut, just not normally cut like any other key.  It uses a three
dimensional cutting platform.  Look at your key and you will see that it is
cut in three dimensions, not just cross cut along the front and rear edges.

It is a high security key, not easily duplicated.  And if you had purchased
your car new, you would be far more concerned with theft.

It also activates the factory alarm system, which probably wasn't on any
other car you had.  If you have a factory alarm.  The key for the alarm
switch is longer than any valet key you may have.

Bite the bullet, get the key cut.  You will be much happier spending $25.00
now, that multiples of $25.00 later when you are locked out of your car.
