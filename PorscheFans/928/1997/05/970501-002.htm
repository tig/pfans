You do not need to remove the cam pulley and should not do so unless
it is required.

My car is a 32 valves 85 model so messing up is somewhat more
dangerous then with your car.  But, while you are in there, you
might want to change the water pump and its gasket.  They are priced
at <$100 and failiure can be costly.

Before installing the pump back on, you need to put some blue RTV
sealant
on BOTH side of the pump gasket.  I am not sure why but that was the
instruction
given to me.  Because of the "double coverage" from the sealant, you do
not
nead to put too much on.

I changed the rubber cover and clamp on my tensioner as it was totaly
dried up and craked.  While the tensioner is off, make sure that the
disk inside stay in their original position.  I did not see any marking
on them and could only have guest how to put them back in in the right
order.  Has you have red in your manual, the order of the disk is very
important for the tensioner to work properly.

If you take your tensionner apart, you want to make sure that the piston
move smoothly.  Mine was not very smooth probably due to the rubber
boot having desintegrated.  My mechanic used a "ball" hone in the
cylinder and I used a 1000 grit paper to make the cylinder smooth again.

Of course, if you take the tensioner off, you will need to replace the
gasket
behind it.  Make sure that the old gasket is totally removed before
reinstalling the new one.  You do not want to leak the oil out of the
tensioner.

The tensioner's adjusting screw has a blue sealant ring somewhere in the
middle of the thread.  DO NOT CLEAN THIS OFF.  This was part of the
original bolt and is essential to preventing leak on the tensionner. 
That
bolt is worth ~$10 if I remember well.

Once the tensioner is back on the engine, do not put the oil in it just
yet.
This will make installing the belt a little easier.  On the subject of
oil
in the tensioner, you need to put TRANSMITION GEAR OIL.  Not engine oil
in 
there.  As I understand, the oil is present to ensure proper heat
conduction 
to the tensioner so that the little ring can do their job.  The oil is
added
from the lower of the two plug until no air bubble come out of the top
plug.

To put the belt back on, you will most probably need a strong friend as
it 
seems like the belt needs to be streched in place.  A set of 2 30 mm (?)
wrench
will also come in handy to old the cam pulley at their #1 TDC position. 
I am
not certain of the exact size of the wrench to be used but you need to
hold the 
cam gears by the hexagonal "washer" held in place by the 17 mm bolt.

Once the belt is on, and tensionned, rotate the engine a few time by
hand.  Check
that the belt is still in the right position (sometime you end up a
tooth off
due to some slack in the belt.  Then do a final tension test and start
assembling
everything back together.

I was told to put antiseize on all the bolts and make sure that you use
a torque
wrench (I know this is obvious).  The problem is that the aluminum is
probably
a little softer then original and stripping is VERY easy.  If it is
available,
someone recommended using a tap in all the bolt hole to ensure they are
clean
before putting the bolts in.

Before you put the alternator back on its bracket, make sure that you
put
the rear cover back on.  It will be impossible to put one of the bolt
holding it up once it is installed.

I am planning to write the procedure to change the belt and providing it
for the FAQ.  In the mean time, if you have any other questions,  Please
let 
me know.

PS.  I posted this to the list in case someone would disagree with the
	procedure.  They might be able to provide with other pertinent 
	information that I either do not know or forgot...
