     Hey gang:
     
     I just wanted to give an update re: my "Brake Pressure" warning light 
     in case anyone was curious.  If you recall, it came on one day and 
     upon further inspection I was unable to find anything wrong with the 
     brake system.  I forgot who recommended disconnecting the battery and 
     waiting a minute but I tried that and it worked.  For two days.  After 
     the light came on a second time, I figured that I could be just as 
     obstinate as any old Porsche and I disconnected the battery a second 
     time.  So far it has been a week so I am asking all of you to cross 
     your fingers once for me.  Also, thanks again for all the useful 
     advice.
     
     My next problem is with the door locks.  The tumbler (or whatever we 
     want to call the actual hole where you stick the key) on the driver's 
     side is stripped.  It will revolve 360 degrees without doing anything. 
      I haven't taken the door apart yet, but I did stop by the local 
     Porsche dealer to see how much replacement tumblers cost.  They wanted 
     $250 for a pair - they  don't sell them separately.  I wouldn't mind 
     carrying around an extra key and would rather just have to replace one 
     (I've already experienced the pleasures of trying to get doors back 
     together).  I suppose it is possible that when I get in there I'll 
     find that the link between the tumbler and the rest of the system is 
     not even broken, just disconnected.  Anyway, if anyone has already 
     invented this wheel and/or knows of a place to get individual tumblers 
     for a reasonable price, I would appreciate the info. 
     
     Also:  
     To Vince and Aqualux re: leaking fuel pressure regulators:
     
     Thought you might be interested to know that I managed to replace my 
     leaking fuel pressure regulators last week in about 45 minutes.  Piece 
     of cake.  I figure I saved $300 over taking it to the dealer and 
     bending over.  Other than breathing 93 octane fumes the entire time, 
     the operation was a breeze.  (Oddly enough, I felt quite happy 
     afterwards - not sure why...)  Anyway, the fuel smell is gone and that 
     baby starts up instantly.  Every time I fix something on this car it 
     drives like new again.  
     
     Long live the world's finest GT.
