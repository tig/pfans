You can check the fuel pressure at a fitting on the front of one
of the fuel rails. Do that before you spring for a new pump or
check valve. Somebody had the cute idea of connecting an oil
pressure sensor there, and wiring it to the oil pressure gauge
via a switch, so that you could have an instant check on the
pressure. Cute, though a leak would be kind of nasty.
