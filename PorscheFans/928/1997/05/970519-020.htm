Hi everyone- On my '89 GT, the trunk won't let go after I pull the lever to
release it. What I have to do is first pull on the button next to the front
seat, then use my key to open the trunk. The motor works because I hear it
move but it dosen't 'pop' off.  I don't know what to do to fix it.  I had a
problem with my 86 I had but that was because the electronics were shot when
it was struck by lightning. 

   Also, does anybody know where to get the rear air ducts besides the
dealers. I tried 928 INT. for used ones but they didn't have any.

 Thanks
    matt,  928 GT
