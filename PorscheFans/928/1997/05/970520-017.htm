Hi Folks,=20
I have a 88 S4.  The numbers under the carpet are as follows:
128-1823   USS
WPOJBO 92xJ8860934
M2841-813-62813
L700-PB
C03 158 418 481 494
570 650
I understand that the engine type is M2841 and I think that 62813 is =
gearbox.
If anyone can decifer the above or point me to a source it would be of =
great interest.  I am trying to see if the car came with Sport Dampers =
and springs.  The ride certainly feels quite stiff relative to a friends =
87.
Also, James Morrison posted:
<Just put in my new "Stargate Superion" headlight bulbs today!! WOW are =
these things bright, and very white too! I have not driven with them =
yet, I just sat in the car with them on and switched from hi to low beam =
and they seem very good. No undo load on the alternator that I can tell =
either.
Stock lights are 45watt low/65 watt high and these are 80 watt low/ 100 =
watt high (I think Phil is running even higher power lights than this), =
so these are much brighter than normal.>
Where did you get these bulbs?  I would like to replace my stock ones as =
well, but I do not know of a source. =20
Could you please forward the vendor. =20
Thanks in advance.
