Patrick,

Thanks for the info on the secondary kickdown switch.  It makes a lot of sense,
to be able to downshift in a curve before a full throttle exit as you
described. The location sounds also good - it gives the "clutch foot" something
to do...

Seems like putting the second switch in parallel with the original offers some
nice flexibility.

I have to admit that the auto is taking some getting used to, but overall I am
growing very fond of my car over the first few weeks of ownership.  I have
drained the ATF twice since I bought it, and have ensured that the level is
correct.  I suspect that even though the car had only 30K on it the fluid
degraded over the decade.

Thanks for your help!
