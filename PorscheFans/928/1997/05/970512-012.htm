Mike,

I know exactly what you are talking about.  I bought my car last Nov and the
PO said that she thought her husband had put chips in it and I was thinking
NO-WAY...my V8 T-bird could have ripped the 928 up!  I bought some
Autothority chips took out the brain opened the box and quite to my
surprise...Autothority chips right there plugged in!  I could not believe it
and was a bit pissed.

Well, I had it opened so I decided to go ahead and put the new ones in
anyway.  I finally got the car all back together and went out on the highway
and was amazed...the car was transformed, and it was FAST!!  I have lately
been getting after the 928 5sd guys pretty good w/ my auto...I think that is
a reasonable improvement in performance.

I would say that you got a bad set of chips...either something bad inside the
chip or bad/old and wrong programing of the chip.  Incidentally my old chips
had been programed in about '90 and the new ones had been programed in '95 or
'96.  I would send them back to Autothority and tell them your experience.
 They will certainly give you your money back.
