Hey Zekkus,
My Euro spec has the Daimler Benz automatic transaxle.  In fast, open
autocrosses, the auto can be an advantage.  My car will reach 78 mph in
second gear, which is perfect for a fast autox.  It is reluctant to down
shift to first gear, but unless its a straight acceleration shot, the
tires spin in first anyways.  Now at Lime Rock Park, it leaves something
to be desired.  Second is too short, third is too tall.  The four speed
auto just isn't geared well for the track.  If there was some way to
change rear end ratios easily, you could gear an auto for max of 130 or
140 mph and have killer acceleration!!!

Does anyone know if a person has changed the rear end ratio in a 928 std
or auto transaxle?  It would be interesting to hear about.

Everyone keep track of paulh@fluidesign.com's standard euro spec
transaxle.  I'd love to convert to a '87 and on clutch and a euro spec
tranny(if it's even possible)!
