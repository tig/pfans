I am new to the list having recently purchased  a 85 928S, black/black 
w/80K. Typically, I have been busy fixing things, but basically its in
pretty good shape. First some answers:
	Bruce Gilman- seat switch.  I would blow on that sucker with everything
available and hope its dirt. The switch can't be repaired and cost me
$104+ at Automotion.
	Matt and Stephane- Hatch latch. My opener does what Matt's does.
I worked on it for an hour last night - no joy. The motor works, the
plunger goes up, but it doesn't open. I adjusted the latch itself and
the opener mechanism up and down- no luck.If anybody gets it- let me
know.
	Re: Hutchisons 79 928- He's the original owner alright, but I could
swear it was Yellow when I last saw it many years ago.
	Everybodys talking about the Devek catalogue, where exactly does one
obtain a copy?
	Brakes and more brakes. I listen to your sad tales about your brakes
and I will add to your woes. I believe that you all have a caliper
rebuild in your future - not a fun job!
	Where is this pony express do someone was talking about last week? 
	The cover for my spare tire compartment is missing. What is it made of
and look like? Can you make one or are they cheap and obtainable? I'd
appreciate anybody chiming in.
	Climate Control- If anbody has it totally figured out< I'd pay
handsomely for a 30 miniute video on the subject. After many years of
no-brain Japanese climate,the German approach is a rude awakening.
	I guess I've worn out my welcome by now, so I'll catch my breath while
you all ponder my problems.
