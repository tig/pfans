Hello Everyone,
While in Ocean City, MD this past weekend cruising  back from Springfest, I 
had an encounter with a 540i.  I was creeping up to a red light in 
anticipation of it turning green.  I was in 2nd and only turning 600 rpm.  The 
light turns green and the 540i bolts.  So I'm in the wrong gear, but I manage 
to keep up with him.  Well, forewarned is forearmed.  At the next light we 
both come to a dead stop.  I'm now in first with the revs up.  The light turns 
green and I say SEEYA!  That's the last I saw of the 540i.  Either he's at the 
nearest Porsche dealership or welding his doors back on.
