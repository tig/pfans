  This is interesting.  I called to order the book and had
  given them all my info EXCEPT the credit card number when 
  I asked to confirm the price.  The guy told me $99.95.  I
  said I heard they were selling it for $59.95 and he said
  no - it was $99.95.  I politely declined to place the order.
  
  A few minutes later, I got a call back from them saying the
  manager is offering a special price of $59.95.
  
  Don't pay too much.
