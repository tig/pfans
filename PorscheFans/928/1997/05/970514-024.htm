My $0.02 on the topic:  We all know the 928's myriad strengths, and both
automatics & 5 speeds share them: power, torque, speed, grip, unbreakable
strength, monster brakes, multi-dimensional capabilities, etc.  The Porker's
weaknesses are less often discussed by we converts, and as a recent buyer
(Jan. 97) I am still very aware of the big fella's shortcomings, which,
IMHO, the transmission decision affects.

The principal problems of the 928 for an enthusiastic driver are 1) weight
(or, more precisely, the sensation of great mass in all axes of motion) and,
2) -- how to say this? -- "too much too good."

1) Porsche did a remarkable job of retaining both agility and stability in
such a massive device, but you can feel its mass in every motion:
accelleration & braking, yaw & pitch changes, ride motion & compliance,
reaction to & resistance to cornering forces, control weight, travel &
response.  The automatic transmission increases this sensation SLIGHTLY by
decoupling the car from engine braking, the softening effect of the torque
converter to subtle throttle changes, and the decoupling of the driver's
innate control of & reaction to the "throtle position/gear ratio/car
attitude" relationship.  The 5 speed returns all of this to the driver's
control at the expense of more work.  The key word, in either case, is
SLIGHT.  But I get the impression that our correspondent speed-freaks on
this list (Hi, Phil!) are looking for more power to address a rather
different problem.

2) I attribute the press criticism of the 928, and the non-response of the
many who chose NOT to buy a 928 when new, to the simple fact that the car is
just too damn good at damn near everything... to the point of monstrously
nerve-deadening absolute competence.  Even if you ignore the fact that the
special sporting qualities of the 928 aren't approached in 90+% of driving
situations, few roads or driving circumstances allow us -- those with any
common sense responsibility for our own actions -- to event approach the
delicious moment of balance, responsiveness & power of which the car is
capable.  Even fewer of us are drivers able to master a car travelling at
the speeds required to make a 928 truly come alive.  Honest magazine road
tests all noted their inability to trigger the ABS or to force the car into
the photo editor's favorite opposite lock slide.

I thought long and hard before deciding to go 928 (vs. more nimble machines
like 914's, Alfas, various Lotus models, etc.), but I must say that, apart
from my very occasional trips to the mountains, my daily drives consist
mostly of continuing delayed gratification (too much delay, not enough
gratification).  It's been a month since I crossed 5,000 rpm...

Such a thrilling machine, but so few thrills (apart from being a bright red
cop magnet!).  I'm having serious second thoughts, serious enough to
consider selling & moving on.  Is there a doctor on the list?  Is my hour up
yet?  I think I need counseling.
