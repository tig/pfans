I am in the market for a set of 4 five spoke Porsche 930 wheels or
knock-off/after market wheels that would fit my '87 928s4.  I currently
have 16in wheels but want to move up to 17in wheels.  If anyone has
wheels for sale or can recommend a source other then Tire Rack or
Discount Tires I would appreciate a reply.

If the puff of smoke is white, then you have a blown gasket.  If blue, 
then you're burning oil, if black then you're running rich.

Can you elaborate on this?  I've been using 10W40 for the past 8 years 
and my 928S is not complaining.
