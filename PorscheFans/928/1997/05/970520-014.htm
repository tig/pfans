  I don't know what brand of battery AutoZone sells to fit the 928, but
  I've had bad experiences with some "cheap" batteries.  I've found that
  the cases on them tend to leak after a year or two.  The brands that
  I'm going to stay away from are Champion and Energizer (both are available
  from places like Sam's Wholesale and Walmart).  I'm currently using a
  Die Hard in the 928 and an Interstate battery in my wife's car and haven't
  had any leaks or problems.
  
  I also spent a few dollars and put a battery mat in the bottom of the battery
  compartment on the 928, just as extra insurance.  Imparts Ltd. has them
  for $4.49 (http://www.imparts.com/battery.html)
