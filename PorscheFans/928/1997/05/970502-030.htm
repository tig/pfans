>>1. What octane gasoline should i put in it? Any recommendations on brand? I
>>have always been partial to mid-grade Texaco gas for my other cars, but I
>>would gladly switch if any of you felt strongly about another brand or
>>another octane for this car.

Shop manual says RON/MON/CLC 91/84/87, which means regular gas. You
might have enough carbon in there to require higher octane, so
listen carefully for pinging if you try regular.

>>2. What weight oil should i put into it? I dont want to burst any bubbles
>>but i read in consumer reports that all synthetics are created equal -
>>brand isnt important, but I dont have any clue what viscosity to run in
>>this vehicle.

Shop manual calls for single weight for your year, but for 15W-50
as of '80. Probably the change represents improvement in oil
technology, or Porsche testing, rather than a change in the engine.

>>4. Is there any benefit (without getting carried away) to putting any
>>assorted 'performance mods' on this car - like a K&N air filter, or
>>'hot-chipping' the brain? Thus far its the fastest car I've owned but i
>>would be curious if I could make it run a bit more efficiently.

The FI controller in your car is an analog device, hence can't
be "chipped".
