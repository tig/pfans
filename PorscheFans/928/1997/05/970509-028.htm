Hi Vince,

I'm the guy Pat was talking about.  I bought a '79 928 with a great body and 
engine (65K miles verified) and a totally crappy interior.  I basically gutted 
the interior of that car and recovered, placed and/or redyed the entire thing 
and added a six speaker stereo system.  I was lucky enough to buy a complete 
928 black leather interior from a junk yard here in Houston for $800 including 
six way power seats in great condition.  However the dash in both cars were 
cracked.

I extricated the dash (which is easier than most people realize) from the car 
and took it down to Hicks Brothers Upholstery Shop (again here in Houston).  
Jim Hicks is the owner and a really great guy.  He's in his sixties and has 
been in the business for over 40 years.  I've done business with him before as 
he completely redid a 1963 Buick LeSabre convertible for me, including 
replacing the top, for $1200.  He uses top quality materials and can match 
virtually any color and grain; which he orders from a large warehouse locally 
before each job.  Despite his low prices, I've never seen his shop compromise 
on the quality of their work.

I showed him the dash and asked his opinion.  He quickly confirmed that this 
was previously a stock leather dash (ie. factory leather over stock vinyl) and 
could be easily recovered with high quality vinyl.  I chose the color (black) 
and grain to match the seats and his crew went to work.  They sanded down the 
raised areas around the cracks and filled in the cracks with some type of 
putty.  They then used a very large heat gun to shape and mold the vinyl sheet 
to *EVERY* contour on the dash using copious amounts of glue and elbow grease. 
 Initially they said they may have to stitch the dash together at the corners 
(like the leather dash is done) but they were able to fit the whole vinyl 
sheet to the entire dash.  they wrapped and trimmed the edges and handed it 
back to me.

The end result?  A completely *NEW* looking vinyl dash for the grand total of 
$90 (tax included)!  The whole job took them about an hour.  Needless to say 
this was the crown piece to my new interior.  I quickly Armoralled it (Jim's 
recommendation) and bought a windshield cover.

I've got a few pictures of the process I went through to reclaim this car's 
interior.  I'll scan them this weekend and post them to my personal webs site.

FYI, that 928 is now for sale as well as the 928 Euro (that still needs alot 
of work).  I'll post a more formal "For Sale" message with details in a couple 
of days.

Drive Fast But Safely,
