Brian,

You are describing what my pressure was doing before I change the
sender.
Do you have 5 bar as soon as you turn the ignition on?  (ie. engine is
not
running??)  If you take a resistance measurement of the sender (or pin
#2 and
#4 on the wiring harness next to the Positive terminal under the hood)
you should
have ~ 5.2 ohm.  My old sender had absolute resistance (ie, something
was broken
inside...).  This was a surprise to me as the sender was the newest
looking thing
on the car.

Hope this help,
