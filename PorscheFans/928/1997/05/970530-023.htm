Now couple of question for you guys:
   - do any of you work to make a living, have a job ???
   - if the answer is yes, how do you manage your time ?
   - between working on your "toys", reading and writing messages to this forum,
     time spent at work, do you have time to do anything else, not to mention
     having time left to drive your pride and joy ?

<Someone replied:>
Actually, most of us are unemployed 928 owners that hang out at busy street
corners sitting next to our cars with a laptop in one hand so that we can
answer each other's questions, and a sign in the other that reads "Will work
for parts.". :)

Very nice smart-ass reply!  As a marketer (20 years in performing arts
marketing, mostly for major symphony orchestras) I'm curious about who we
are, we brave, we few, we 928 drivers.  My guess -- and believe me, never,
ever trust a marketer who doesn't/won't admit he's guessing! -- is that
there are two distinct profiles for Porker Pilots:

1) Wealthy people who thought Mercedes SL's were too common, but still
wanted a comfortable car with sporting pretensions for lugging the clubs to
the clubs.  Almost 100% automatic buyers.  A mix of both hard workers &
trust fund babies (the former kept their cars for a long time, the latter
got bored after two years.)  Few-to-None on this list.  You know the type...
you go to talk to them in the parking lot, introduce yourself as a fellow
owner, and the only enthusiasm they show is for getting away from you.  They
do NOT wave back.

2a -- buyers of new 928's) Wealthy people who wanted a reliable
high-performance car that would last and could excel in multiple roles --
daily cruise/commute, sports car & mile eater.  The prestige & Porsche image
didn't hurt, but they were more impressed by the car's modernity, NASA-like
"systems" and balance.  Many entrepreneurs and professionals in technical
areas.  While they may have the knowledge to do so, they rarely work on
their own cars.  Time-of-ownership varies across the board, from short
leases to 10+ year owners.  May or may not be the "enthusiast/hobbyist type"
-- about their cars or anything else.
2b -- buyers of used 928's) Similar to "2a" but without the stigma of excess
money.  Highly educated, often in technical professions, working in high
stress/high hour but not necessarily high paying jobs (education,
government, research, small business owners/entrepreneurs mortgaged to the
max, non-profit guys like me, younger medicos digging out from crippling
debt, etc.)  A Porsche, or the Reubenesque-Rocket in particular, has been a
long-time dream.  How do they find time for: 1) driving, 2) maintaining, 3)
participating on the list?  These are folks who are used to making hard
choices about their time.  Their car is one of the reasons they work so hard
at their "real lives," so this is important to them.  A close look at any
one inedividual's lifestyle will clearly show what does matter (things that
get time & attention) and what does not (home repair, filing, cleaning,
vacation planning, etc. -- you know what it is in your life).  The time
spent on the list is actually very efficient, direct hobbyist-to-hobbyist
without delays, and easily fit into gaps in other areas of life.

Now, I understand that the joys of the web include the ability to remain
relatively anonymous (no one on this list is likely to ask another to borrow
a hedge trimmer) and the ability to carve this one focused slice out of the
rest of our existence (no one cares about my breath, the boss, the kid's
latest emotional trauma, etc.)  
Nonetheless, WHO ARE YOU (we)?  WHAT DO YOU DO?  HOW OLD ARE YOU?  Try
tossing a few tidbits into your next posting as a "P.S."  (Mine follows)

Rob Gold

P.S.
Age 42, married 14 years, divorced 3 years ago (amicably), no kids.  20
years in performing arts administration -- mostly marketing, mostly big
symphonies.  Yes, a "palladin" careerist, but driven by ideals.  Too damn
many 70-80 hour weeks!  Native Detroiter (middle class suburban) but always
loved sports cars.  Like a baby duckling I was "imprinted," my time being
the late 60s-early 70s, feverishly searching out obscure foreign car &
motorcycle mags & covering the walls of my bedroom with clipped photos.
Ipso facto, this is where my dream cars are from.  Prefer the intellectual
purity of motorcycles but physics & a too vivid imagination limit my ability
to enjoy actually riding them.  On the cusp between two types: "artsy
technoid" & "logical artsy."  Lived in: Detroit, Lansing, Charlottesville,
St. Louis, metro NYC, Indianapolis, now Tucson, but probably moving again
soon.  Read: SF, mysteries (best = Ross Thomas!), architecture & urbanology.
Play: Downhill skiing, table tennis & hiking, but few chances in recent
years (see "choices," above!).  Don't know what to make of "Woof!" in web
posts...
