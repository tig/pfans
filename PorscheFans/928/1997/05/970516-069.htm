St=E9phane, thanks for your reply.  I live in the LA area, and although n=
ew to
the "928 culture", I have been involved with Porsches for years.  I fact,=
 I'm
going through my car from top to bottom in order to prepare it for track =
use
with the PCA, POC and other groups I've run with over the years.  I'm pla=
nning
on exchanging my brake fluid this weekend as part of this.

I believe that the area of exchanging brake fluid is mostly overlooked - =
until
the brakes become a problem.  That's why I believe that several "flushes"=
 may
be required to make up for what is likely a decade or so of neglect.
 Excersizing the pistons may do the trick may do the trick if the fluid c=
hange
alone doesn't fix it.

Failing these approaches, I have had good results with disassembling the
calipers and putting them back together with the rebuild kits. These kits=

contain rubber "O" ring seals for the pistons and boots that snap into pl=
ace
around the piston. Compared to most things you buy for Porsches, they are=

relatively cheap.

Also, I don't know if it's approved or not, but I polished the pistons wi=
th
Crocus cloth (#600 or finer emery cloth) to remove some corrosion on them=
=2E
 With the high cost of caliper replacement, I thought it was worth a shot=
 - and
for my car it worked well.

On my previous car, a Turbo Carrera, the PO had torqued the brake fluid c=
ap
down and caused it to split.  This caused a bad situation where dirt go i=
nto
the system, along with moisture.  But rebuilding the calipers as noted ab=
ove
got them to work well again.

You may want to try the caliper work before biting the financial bullet o=
n the
master cylinder, unless it's leaking.  Since you mentioned that the front=
s
dragged differently at times, it seems to me that the dragging is probabl=
y in
the calipers.  Another note, the brake fluid is highly toxic, so I think =
it's
important to save for the hazardous waste pickup folks.

The Fred Flinstone school of braking (step #3) is sponsered by your local=
 shoe
store...  At a weight of 3500# it would take some serious Mosh Booties!
