Greetings!,

	Anyone have any experiences they could share on fitting supercharger(s)
to the 16-valve engine?. I have two KF roots blowers that are very
efficient. They each measure about 4 inches tall by about 14 inches
long. On a 2.8L V-6 single blower installation, boost values approach
7-8 lbs., and driving the two of them at a 1:77 to 1 ratio should yield
about 10 lbs. on the 928 install. 
	So, one of the items I am seeking is a complete plenum w/runners from
the early engine. I understand that the Euro plenum may have had better
flow. Can anyone confirm this?. I plan on making a jig around this
plenum, and then doing the cutting-welding-machining that is necessary
to make the install as lo-profile as possible. 
	Because I have the '79 fuel-injection type, I think I can utilize a
"draw-thru" design, add a "ninth" injector in the plenum to cool the
compressed charge and maintain a tractable torque curve with a
"speed-density" mapping. Calculations I have done show a power output
approaching 400 h.p. @ 5000 rpm. The torque increase is a concern, and I
had previously posted a message that did not make it on the list about
whether any owners had info on the torque tube reaction to power gains.
	Any comments regarding the engine/drive-train reaction to boost
pressure would be greatly appreciated. Why am I doing this?. Well, I
live in Colorado @ 5000+ ft., and while the available power is somewhat
acceptable at sea level---we lose about 15-20% here, and this fact
leaves me little choice--I love the car, but need more ponies!.

Thanks to those behind this list, and the frequent contributors---it is
the best resource, by far, I have come across for the 928.

Regards, Mike McLaughlin

You can overhaul the compressor as noted on the service manual.  But to 
answer your question, I guess the only way to test it yourself is 
either verify the temperature drop when AC is on and/or check for freon 
leakage around the compressor drive shaft and behind the clutch with a 
sniffer while in operation.  The preferred solution is to take it to an 
AC shop and have them check it.

Oh, by the way... there's a possibility that the the hi temp caused by 
the heli-arcing will damage the seals inside the compressor.   So far, 
mine's been working.
