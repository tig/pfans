Greetings to all,

I imagine most of you take on the task of changing the oil and filter on
your 928's.  My 87S4 as most others (if not all others) has an aerodynamic
pan covering the entire bottom side of the engine compartment.  I've had to
fiberglass reinforce a couple of the bolt holes in the panels from the wear
and tear it receives at each oil and filter change.

In an old corvett I had, I installed a remote oil filter which made ti a
snap to change filters without doing all the gymnastics requred.  Has
anybody used anything like this? I was also thinking about having a
hydraulic shop make me up a lne to act as a remote oil drain as well.  Using
these two components would eliminate the need to remove the bottom pan at
each oil change!

If anyone knows of any such parts commercially available or the dimensions
required for these parts, please post.

Thanks,

Alan
