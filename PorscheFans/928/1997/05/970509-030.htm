It's always been one of my secret desires to own a car with cruise
control.  When I bought my 928 the car itself hadn't run in over three
years, but I saw that it had the control stick for cruise and I was all
the more excited to get my diamond in the rough running.  When I started
to trouble shoot the cruise, I realized that the brain and the servo
were missing!  (I got all the computer control boxes in one big
cardboard box, so it wasn't obvious that it wasn't with the car).  I
bought the entire cruise unit from Gregg in Boston.  I put it in and was
extremely disappointed when it didn't work.  Following the Shop manuels,
every failed step indicated to "Replace Control Unit".  The PN on the
box I have is 928.617.127.00.  Does this match to anyone elses units? 
Does any one have an extra, known working unit, that I can try.  I'm
willing to put a security deposit down if need be.  If I knew of any
local 928 owners, I'd ask, and very few 928s show up at the PCA
autocrosses.
