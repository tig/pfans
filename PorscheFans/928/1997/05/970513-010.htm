The electric fan is controlled by two switches in parallel: the
coolant temperature switch and the refrigerant temperature switch.
If either temperature is high enough, the fan relay is picked and
the fan goes on. So you may find that the fan goes on if you're
running the A/C, even if the coolant temp isn't that high. It may
be that you have a bad coolant temp switch, if the fan doesn't
go on with the coolant temperature really high - the challenge is
to figure out which of the many temperature sensors is the one
that controls the fan.
