Hi=20

I have got a 928 S4 '88 Pickup (its true). Im writing from Denmark, a =
place where you have to be mentally disordered to pay the taxes which =
are put in cars. A well-used 928 '77 can easily cost between 40 and 50 =
000 - and yes Maggie thats in US dollars! If you had wanted to buy one =
of the last GTS's and have danish license plates on it, you would had to =
pay about 300 000 US dollars to get it - without the leather seats of =
course !

BUT if you have a pickup (very complex rules define what a pickup should =
look like) you won't be punished as much.

The car drives like an uncastrated specimen, and it can be very =
practical to have room for 400 kg's of mortar or a small goldfish pond. =
The conversion has been done very elegantly (at least I think).

It is a real pleasure to subscribe to this list. Hope you can accept a=20
928 S4/2 !
