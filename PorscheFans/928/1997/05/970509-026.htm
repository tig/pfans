     Jerold:
     
     First of all, congratulations on your purchase of the World's Finest 
     GT.  As long as you don't expect Honda reliability, you are sure to 
     enjoy it.  
     
     My only words of wisdom for you and others who do their own work is to 
     get a copy of Excellence magazine and check out the many parts ads.  
     These prices are often much lower than the identical part would be 
     from one of those companies that publish a glossy parts "magazine" 
     (i.e. Automotion).  Just make sure you get the brand name that you are 
     looking for when it matters.  I have found that I can often get the 
     very same Bosch or Porsche part for much less by calling two or three 
     of these companies and specifying exactly what I need.  Ain't 
     capitalism grand?  Also, if you have access to a microfiche machine, I 
     would highly recommend getting a microfiche copy of the service manual 
     - you will save much time and money by knowing exactly how to fix the 
     problems that are bound to surface on these very complex cars.  Or if 
     you can afford $300, get the multi-volume paper copy.  What could be 
     better to keep on the back of the toilet?
     
     As far as the heavy steering is concerned, my guess is that it is 
     normal - especially if you notice it after driving the Town Car for a 
     while.  Whenever I drive someone else's American Dream and then get 
     back in my World's Finest GT it seems like I am driving a tank.  The 
     steering effort is heavy, the brake is like a brick and I remember why 
     I love these cars so much.  Then again, your power steering pump could 
     be going... :-).
