>Being a wide-body design myself, I must say that the Lotus Elan +2 is a
better fit than the gorgeous Elite.  Who today, in their right mind, would
buy a corpulent Boxter, Z3 or SLK when such a creature as the Lotus Elise
treads the roads???

The Elise is quite fantastic, agreed, and I would happily own one.  Only trouble
is, when I look at it, my old Seven is MUCH better value for money.  Sure, the
aerodynamics make a difference in the Elise and make up for it being a little
underpowered, and the handling is crisp and beautiful.  But here in NZ a new
Elise will add $60,000 to my overdraft and I would only get about $15,000 for
the Seven.  The seven is a lightly tweaked Lotus Twin Cam with about 135bhp
in a 1300lb car made out of Lots Of Triumph's Unused Spares.  (Which of course,
us what LOTUS stands for.)  The Elise is held together with glue.  I think
I'll wait a few years and make sure it stays that way.
