Apparently not much, Andy.  I found some really wild facts about what they
asked people.  30% of people don't know the Sun is a star.  And Bill, I've
heard that West Virginia thing too.  Its really hilarious on the Tonight
Show with Jay Leno when he goes out on the street and asks questions to
serious and stupid questions and for the most part, the only answers people
know are to the stupid questions.  Crazy world we live in here isn't it?
How can you trust someone to make an informed, intelligent decision, when
they know about nothing going on in the world around them.

I guess that's why everybody's not clamoring to buy 928s ;)
