I got stopped like this in a very similar situation. Night, long windy dark
road, 30 mph limit, cruising at 50-60. I come to the top of a fill and
whamm, my detector shows the instant on warnings. I brake *very* quickly to
about 35, he pulls me over and gives me a ticket for 50 MPH, using radar
and *estimate*. I assume he couldn't get a good reading, so he had to
indicate it was estimated. Now if I wasn't driving a car that looked like
mine (fluidesign.com/928), maybe I would have been ok. But no such luck.
The appeal at court is this Monday (Wellesley, MA cop, Dedham court, anyone
know someone to fix it for me, I'll give you 928 parts in exchange!), or
else, I get my license revoked for 60 days.
