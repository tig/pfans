Hello Rob,
I see your posts every so often in Porsche fans.  I'm living in Mesa.  I
 don't often get down Tucson way often.  Do you make it up north much?
 
I haven't seen much 928 action in AZ.  Are you aware of any sports car
oriented groups that share our interest?  I haven't looked into the Porsche
Car Club, most of them are 911 or 356 fans.  Don't have anything against
them, though.
 
I have a '93 928 GTS Amazonasmetallic (Blue/Green), my second 928.  My first
was an '84 928S. Love'm.  So, drop a line if you'll be up PHX way, I'll do so
if I'm go'n down.

Yo, Rich,
I've counted about twenty 928's in Tucson alone.  I am not (yet) a member of
the Souther AZ PCA, so I don't know how active they are.  My excellent
mechanics (Dan Oebker and Waltt Harrington of Franklin Services in Tucson)
are active with the ASRA, which I understand started as a Cobra club but now
encourages all comers at their PIR and Firebird track events.

No, I don't get the PHX much.  I am planning, however, to make it up for the
very busy weekend of Sat., December 6th &/or Sun, December 7th.  Over this
weekend there will be ASRA track racing and Solo II (auto-x) events at
Firebird, and I understand that there will be some sort of event(s) at PIR as
well.  Owing to a combination of aging rotors/pads and similarly depleted
finances, I'm holding off on track events for right now...   |:^-(= ... but
perhaps we could connect at one of these events.

There is one other 928@porschefans.com list participant here in Tucson, Stan
Clayton (I'm responsible, for better or worse, for pointing him to the white
'86 928 S 5-speed that is now his wife's daily driver.  Lucky girl!).  Stan's
at: galaxy2@flash.net.
I'll cc him this to solicit a mini-frenzy (or do only three 928's constitute
something else, a school or something?).

I don't have any details about the 12/6-7 events beyond the above, but I will
investigate & report back if either you, Stan or any 928 list lurkers express
interest in  get-together.

There is, of course, the giant Barrett-Jackson classic car auction in
Scottsdale on Jan. 15-18.

P.S.
'93 GTS?  Whooomphffffff! (add doppler effects for full impact!)  Contact
