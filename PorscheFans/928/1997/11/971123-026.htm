Fellow 928'ers, may I pick your brains?

Currently, I am experiencing a few problems in which my 79 928 will NOT want
to start after sitting overnight.  I have read in a previous posting that
someone else has the same problem as I.  If possible, please answer the
following questions, either by posting to this newsletter or via email. 

1- After the car has been sitting overnight, the engine will not start.....a
bit more description: engage starter, engine bumps, rpm shows engine
igniting, and then putters/dies.  After about five minutes of bumping the
starter about 5 seconds each time, it will finally start and then "lug",
which will dissappear after the engine begins warming up to operating specs.
Oxygen sensor? Cold starting sensor? Reflector Bulbs?  : ) 

2- Then after the engine is running, and has reached operating temps, IT is
running excessively rich.  No smoke of any color is flowing from the exhaust,
but the smell reminds me of starting an old V-8 Mercruiser on a cold winter's
morning.  Is it the fuel setting?  Oxygen sensor?  Cold starting sensor?
Muffler bearings?   : )

3- When starting off in first or second, when the clutch is fully engaged, it
feels as if the shuttering is going to vibrate all of the torque specs on the
car loose.  Is there a way to "adjust" the slave cylinder, the clutch,
linkage, etc?  I hate the feeling, and I can just imagine what damage is
occurring to my drivetrain. 

4- Finally, I am in search of a few cosmetic items, like the sideview mirror
control knob, the analog clock set-screw, and a new gearshift/boot (black
rubber and leather).  If you have any of these, please send me your price or
the location as to where they can be found.

Take it easy on me gentleman/ladies, I am new to this Shark and the
technology is quite different than the Caterpillar's and the Volkswagen's I
am used to working on.  Any suggestions/references given would be of great
help....or any 928 specialists in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area would be most
appreciated.

Thanks.....and I love this car.....what STAMINA!!!!!
