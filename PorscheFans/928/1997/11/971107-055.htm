Please disregard my earlier post regarding fuel delivery troubles.

In an effort to isolate the problem, I pulled everything apart and
checked fuel pump/delivery - all okay.   Then, decided to check for
anything in the fuel/air warmup circuit by clamping the inlet hose to
the 'auxiliary air valve' and plugging the vacuum outlet on the air
distribution housing where the brake vacuum and engine air management
hose is connected...........VOILA!     In order to determine exactly
which branch was at fault, reconnected hoses and such, and the engine
ran perfectly!   So, even though I don't know exactly whether I somehow
purged trash in the fuel system, or jarred a valve loose, or solved
vacuum leak, the darned thing runs as it should.   I then attached
timing light and tach and tuned it dead-nuts according to
specifications.

For the true test, I then took it for a maiden voyage and must have
looked like Earnest Fixes His Car cuz I had that 'stoopid with ecstacy'
look the whole time.   And, have to confess (Leonard), I broke the
local speed limit.

Soooooooooo...........because I attribute this (hopefully final) fix to
either a) divine intervention; or b) effects of El Nino - I plan to
thank the Big Guy on Sunday and watch a solid hour of The Weather
Channel, just to cover the bases!

Signing off........giddy with excitement........

(PS>    thanks to all who advised and helped!)
