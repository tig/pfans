Too rich could be a leaking cold start injector or one that fails to
shut off when the engine becomes warm.

I agree.  I vote for fuel system pressure regulator, control pressure
regulator, leaking cold start injector or clogged fuel filter. You have
to run the complete fuel pressure test using a fuel pressure gauge with
hoses and valve similar to that sold by Performance Products and
others.  See Motorbooks "How to Tune & Modify Bosch Fuel Injection" ISBN
0-87938-570-7 about $20.  Essential reading for any Bosch injected car.
Covers Motronic & Jetronic D,L,LH, K, KE systems. Has extensive "how to"
guides for testing the system.

I don't believe so.  When I thought I had a failing fuel pump, I was
told that the failure mode is either reducing output volume over a
period of time (as pump gets weaker) followed by sudden total failure or
just sudden failure. My fuel pump was fine.

This is the last place to look.  The distributor is VERY expensive and
allegedly not rebuildable.  But the fuel LINES might be a good place to
look, check for kinks, tight bends etc.

None other than doing or having done a pressure test.  Should take about
an hour of labor to perform - or buy the gauge (around $130) and book
($20) and do it yourself.
