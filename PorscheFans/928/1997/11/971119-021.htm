This is key!!  I had read an article about F1 drivers.  I stated that after=
 testing many of them, they found that
"super" thinking, being able to process many things at once, being fully=
 conscience and being creative were all common traits.  They also said that=
 they were all "right brained".  When they asked a driver to describe what=
 it is like to drive under these conditions he said "it is like driving your=
 car 80 mph on ice".  I think the average driver doesn't understand the=
 force they command behind the wheel of any car.

So use The Force wisely, it once ripped the seams out of my leather jacket=
 as I avoided a collision with a drunk truck driver.
