I too have moved along on the roads above the posted limit. I agree with you
in many aspects of your response. As you said, there was no traffic, so you
were not putting others at risk. However, the "Bears" may not quite
understand your "need for speed" on their turf. Not only will the ticket be
a doozy, but it will likely result in license revocation. The risk of
loosing the privelege to drive (especially a 928) is too much for me to
take.

In any case, be careful and happy motoring. Ed
