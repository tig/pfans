In regards to your "Ooooooh...Scary!", I have to tell you about my
similar story.  I was coming home from a wedding at the tune of about 95
or so.  Up around the bend a little ways were some headlights coming
towards me.  So I naturally pull my foot.  Upon close eyeballing the
headlights were not the "Chevy Caprice" headlight configuration that cops
use around here so I didn't hit the brakes.  Well guess what?  Instant on
when I was about 100 yards from him.  The Valentine One confirms it's him
as I pass him the arrows go toward the rear.  "Sh*t!" I said.  (Well,
maybe I said a little more than that.)  I had slowed to about 75 when he
finally hit me or locked on with his radar.  He spins around & pulls me
over.  Well base on empirical data on what to do when pulled over to make
Mr. Officer feel at ease, I rolled my window down, shut the car off, put
the keys on top of the instrument pod in clear sight, & put my hands in
clear view in about the 10-2 position.


Now getting to the point of my story, as this cop & partner are walking
towards my car I heard them commenting on a radio call they were just
listening to.  It went something like this:

<paraindent><param>left</param>

"Did you hear that?!!!  He was chasing him at over 100 MPH!!!"

</paraindent>

"Great" I thought.


He finally gets to my car & ask me "do you know what I pulled you over
for?"


("Daaaaaaaaaaaa" I thought to myself, maybe it's because I shields up or
cloaking device on?)


"Of course" I respond.


"How fast do you think you were going?" (as he ask for admission of
guilt.)


"Oh about 65".  (I'm on a 55 mph road).


"65!!!!"  I clocked you at 75!!!!  (BFD I thought.)


I held back saying "If you would 've hit me about 5 seconds sooner, you
would 've clocked me at about 95".  Then you would be REALLY EXCITED! 
HA!


But I didn't say that.  He commented on the car & we talked for a bit & I
ended up with a reasonable 65 in a 55.  Not to bad I thought.


Unfortunately I'm not blessed with the gift of bullsh*t like a previous
post I read from the young kid.


***Pause (looking through archives for his name & stories  ....  didn't
find it.)***


Makes me envious on some of stories that he shared that he talked his way
out of.  *That* is what amazes me.


BTW, the cop car turned out to be a New Crown Vic.  That's why I didn't
recognize the headlights.  Hope I didn't bore anyone.
