  Lets say there is a certain person that bought a 928s and has a loan
through a credit union and because of this loan must carry full coverage.
 Now lets say this same car is out of service for a few months because of
some maintenance that needs to be done.  Would anybody at this credit union
find out if coverage was reduced to liability during this time?  This
hypothetical vehicle would be lets say.... insured in chicago and licensed in
Illinois and lets say a nice place for a credit union would be in the
Tulsa/Dallas area.  This person in this hypothetical situation is willing to
take the risk of some knuckle head crashing into him when he takes the car
out occassionally for a test drive while only covered by liability. This
person realizes they would have to pay the loan off even if the car went to
928 heaven.
Would anybody find out?
