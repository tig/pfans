Hello everyone,
All this talk about how to avoid those speeding tickets reminds me of an
encounter I had in my 928 a couple years ago. Traveling down I-64 W. at about
100 mph (I know, I shouldn't be breaking the law!) when I got radared from a
Ky. State Boy going E. After I passed him, I looked in the mirror, and sure
enough, he was cutting thru the median and turning around to come get me.
(lights not on yet) I could also see him becoming smaller in my mirror, so
I'm thinking, do I let off the gas and get a big ticket, or push harder on
the go-pedal and possibly escape. I thought about it for a heart-pounding
nanosecond and assumed that he'd be at least 15 seconds to 100 mph. Since I
was already a good stretch away from him, I had at least a 25 second
headstart. (well, maybe I didn't do the math in a nanosecond...let's just say
I figured I he couldn't catch me) I pushed it on up to 150 + mph and went in
a valley and when I was coming back to the crest, I couldn't see him in my
mirror, so I got off the highway 2 exits and 5 miles later and never saw him
again. Please don't flame me as I'm not proud of this.....well, maybe a
little. :)     It was pretty dumb thing to do.   
Luckily, he didn't have a Cobra, or I'd have just pulled over and threw my
hands up in the air.  :) 
I am the Great Cornholio! ....The streets will flow with the blood of the
non-believers!
(Phil....I loved the "I have GT for his slowbra!" post.)
