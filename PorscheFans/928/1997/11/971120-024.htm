Well, I have #60, and I dont think its worth a darn sight more than any
other car out there.
The really nice thing about it is that its really easy to memorize the VIN#
9288200060.

One thing I would look into before buying this car though, my dealer
mentioned one time, when I stopped in to pick up some fuel filters, that I
was lucky to not have one slightly earlier. He seemed to be under the
impression that some things, such as the fuel system, had been slightly
modified around car #55.  I dont know if there is any truth to this, but it
might be worth looking into. I would imagine it is possible that if they
only made 50 cars with a certain type of fuel system that parts would be
hard to come by!

Does anyone know about this?
