Hello everyone.

I'm in love with the 928.  Most people I know say "what?" when I mention
this car.  Course most of them don't know what a 911 is either....

Anyway, the cars I'm most interested in getting when the time comes (looks
like a year or less) are 85-95 928s (pricing must be right, but I'd love to
find a great GTS).  I've sat in, looked at, and driven several of these
cars (one 85 "S" up to 100 or so) and I love it.  The snarl from the engine
just gives me thrills.

What I'd like to know is your experiences with these cars as well as the
type of maintenance costs that you look at each year (as well as miles
driven) to see what to expect.

If you don't feel the need to post this to the list and use up the BW
there, please just email me directly at need4speed@prodigy.com.

My current car is an 86.5 Toyota Supra, which was apparently semi-born in
928 fashion.  It is a car with similar dimensions, weight (but not power),
and it has many amenities.  Even the wheels don't look that different from
the flat dish wheels of the 928 "S" and S4.  I would have bought myself a
944 until that time, but with my limited amount of time available to look
(its my only car), I couldn't find one that wasn't worn out and beat to
death.  I really didn't want to spend loads of extra money trying to get a
944 back up to good running condition when I could be planning and waiting
for the 928.

Anyways, thank you for any information you can provide, and I'll be lurking
here more of the time, and occasionally popping up until such time that my
ride arrives.

Andrew
