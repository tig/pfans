That sounds like a reasonable situation. I put my car in for removal
of the dash, to replace the burnt up HVAC controls, and to replace
the heater core. 5 WEEKS LATER it still is screwed up! 8 Days...HA!
$270...HA! Try $2,700! Removing the dash created a whole new set of
problems such as the controls still not working, no speakers, no
high beams, broken trim pieces, etc., etc. It was a mess. I always
avoid the dealer, because I feel the labor rate is high, and small
shops are often more reasonable and fair, but perhaps I was wrong. I
know electrical/vaccuum/mechanical controls are a bitch to
troubleshoot, but I think the dealer might have been a bit quicker
than a month+. So you got a rental car, huh? Beyond the repair
bills, I paid 1K for my rental, then had to drive a F***ed up
Mercedes loaner car for the last 2 weeks. AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!!

I still love the car, and plan on getting it up to snuff, but boy
can one bad experience be a huge bummer. See you on the road...
until Monday when I have to bring it back to the shop...
