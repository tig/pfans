<<It seems this week in the Ohio Supreme Court it has been ruled that a

cop CANNOT examine your car if you have been pulled over for a traffic

violation. If the officer says that you are "free to go" and then asked

to see inside your car, then it's your choice and anything found can be

used against you.



I find it hard to believe that Ohio is the only state with a law like

this. I suppose if you are going to risk being pulled over, knowing the

law would be beneficial.>>

Every state does have this law:  It is the 4th ammendment right against
unreasonable searches and seizures, as applied to the states through the 14th
ammendment.  Beware the word unreasonable.

Clearly, without anything else, it is unreasonable to search someones
vehicle.  Therefore they don't have the RIGHT to do it, but surely have the
right to ask to do it.  Just say no.

And when you get the line, "if you don't have anything to hide, why can't I
look?", the (in my opinion) best answer is, "It is embarrasing enough to be
pulled over, I don't want you searching in my car, and I am now leaving if I
am not under arrest."  

If an officer has a reasonable suspicion, still not rising to the level of
probably cause needed for arrest, he might detain you for a reasonable period
of time in order to arrange for a non-intrusive search with a drug sniffing
dog.  The Supreme Court has held that reasonable in that context is about 30
minutes, or so.

If the officer has probable cause to make an arrest, he might arrest you and
obtain a warrant to search the entire vehicle.  Without a warrant a search of
a vehicle incident to arrest is limited in scope.

Be careful out there.  Asserting these rights in a smart-ass way will get you
no where.  There is still such a thing as unofficial enforcement.  Police,
like all human beings, will lie to assert a position favorable to their
actions.  Judges believe police more often than defendants.  Just be polite,
and if you feel like any of the actions have crossed the line you can decide
whether to pursue legal or administrative action to correct the matter.  (as
best you can, at this point)

Remember, there are some "soft" words in those definitions.  You have to ask
yourself what "reasonable" is.  Most people wont agree on a definition, and
the person that counts is the Officer making the stop.  Later, if you are
searched and drugs or whatever found, then the person that counts is the
Judge.  In other words, don't debate your position.  Establish it and
maintain it.  Just say no.

Good luck,

Brian Robinson
