Hi everyone,
I am sending this again because it did not post when I sent it twice before 
so I hope the third time is a charm.

I my 84 928S Stock motor broken timing belt (went at idle) is at European 
AutoWorks in Waterbury CT.  They have leak tested it, seems ok. so the 
runners are off.   I would like to talk with people that have Extrusion 
honed the runners and heads on their 928.  I am also looking for anyone 
that has the Devek cam upgrade in a street car.  I.e. what is your cam 
profile and have you given up any day to day driveablity.  My goal 
depending on budget is: honing, cams and Devek's exhaust headers first go 
round.  Leaving stock lower block except an oil control baffle. Second 
stage is fuel injectors and rising rate regulator.  I have done the 
suspension already, so that will leave a brake upgrade for second quarter 
next year.  Thanks in advance for any help.  By the way anyone that wants 
to send me a private e-mail with their phone number to discuss how they 
have made these mods to their 928 on my dime would be great.

Old 928's never die we just make them go faster
