Greetings:

Since I was curious about the "oil viscosity" issue, knowing that my car
will have the same oil across seasons. I wrote to Mobil about mixing
viscosities. My thought was that since the 928 hold 8+ quarts of oil and
Denver area weather will span 0 to 95 degrees for the six months between
oil changes why not put in 2 quarts of 5w30, 4 quarts of 10w40 and 2
quarts of 20w50? Mobil, after pushing the versitility benefits of their
syn oil, agree that mixing viscosity blends is okay. Mobil's response is
attached below.


Thank you for contacting Mobil. Please accept our apologies for the
delay in responding to your request. We 
have recently moved our E-mail support services department to a new
location, causing our delayed response. 
Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this delay may have caused
you.

>>Mobil 1 10W-30 will provide your engine with the same protection at engine operating temperatures as a 
nonsynthetic SAE 40 engine oil, while at the same time providing
excellent low temperature flow characteristics (-
55F) that help reduce wear at engine startup. There is no need to mix
two Mobil 1 viscosity grades when one oil 
will do; however, it can be done.

If you have any additional questions, you may contact us at our E-mail
address: lubes@ffx.mobil.com or by phone 
at 1-800-9 MOBIL 1.<<

Since they took 6 weeks to respond I would up putting 10w40 Castrol.
