Diablo Region - PCA has just instituted a Monthly Dinner Night.  It's to
be held the third Thursday of each month and will be held in Dublin at
The Dublin Corral restaurant on Dublin Blvd, just off San Ramon Blvd.
They have arranged a private room, parking is ample and free. I'm not
sure whether this is an official PCA event.  I was led to believe that,
similar to our Sat AM breakfast meetings, the format is pretty relaxed.
I don't know the time but I would guess around 7pm.

I'm not sure if I'm up for two dinners on successive evenings but, maybe
just this once....
