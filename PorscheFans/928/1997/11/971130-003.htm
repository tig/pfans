I'm not familiar with Cal's current test.  Are you saying you currently =
do
NOT run your car on a rolling dyno?  We do that in Washington State and =
it
works very easily.

>What a mess this is going to be.  WATCH your car, especially when/where
>it gets strapped down

Are you serious?  They really would strap your car down?  That sounds
ridiculous and would take much too long to perform the test.  After all,
the intent is not to measure HP, but to put a light load on the vehicle.
Here in Washington State you just drive onto a set of rollers.  When the
test starts the rollers are raised and you just put the car in the =
correct
gear to achieve approximately 2500 rpm while you keep the bar graph
indicator within the required mph band.  This is the "loaded" test.
