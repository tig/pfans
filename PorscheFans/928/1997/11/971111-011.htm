The first test you want to pass when getting pulled over, especially at
night on a lonely highway, is the *attitude test* ...

1. Do not get out of the car unless instructed to! Turn off engine.

2. Turn on your top/domelight so the officer can see inside (presumes
you are hiding nothing)(You aren't hiding anything right?)

3. Roll down all windows for same reason, even if it's raining, until
officer(s) can establish you are no threat

4.  Keep your hands on the wheel or in plain view while officer is
approaching.  I usually hang them both out the side window while making
eye contact to try to determine the disposition of the officer (my own
attitude test).

5.  Cooperate, cooperate, cooperate and you just might get off or have
the offense reduced 

6.  Put yourself in his/her shoes - be an a@@ and you'll soon be in the
squadcar instead of your Porsche.  And then he'll be thinking of being
in your shoes by buying your car at the next impound auction.

I hope I've sucked up enough here so I won't be tailed anymore (they're
out to get me you know :) - I have accumulated enough points for the
next two years and don't want anymore!  My procedures might seem
paranoid but given where I live, seems to be the safest approach for all
parties involved.

Keep der shiny side up,

Phil Tong
ps. I don't want to hear about luck o' the Irish either - you need to
slow down too!
