Are you sure? Hot-dip leaves a very uneven coating. Just like dipping 
parts in paint. For precision, electroplating is used. Flat sheets can 
be hot-dip galvanized very smoothly.

Only true if your definition of "rust" is "ferric oxide." The magic 
thing about aluminum (and less so of zinc) is that aluminum *instantly* 
oxidizes when it hits the atmosphere. And forms such an impenetrable 
thin coating of aluminum oxide that protects the rest of the aluminum.

Chemically staining this aluminum oxide coating is known as 
"anodizing".

Rusting and corrosion are electrical chemical reactions. The nice thing 
about zinc is that it will react before steel. The electrons will favor 
the zinc. And the zinc will corrode instead of the steel. A patch of 
zinc will protect steel even if its not covering the steel.

Your hot water heater has one or two magnesium rods, about 3/4" 
diameter, several feet long. They are called "sacrificial anodes". As 
long as they remain your steel tank is safe. The corroding current 
mostly flows thru the easiest path, the anode, sparing the tank.
