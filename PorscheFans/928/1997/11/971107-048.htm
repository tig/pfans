Yep. This is what motivates Kim Crumb and others to change the 928's
front-to-rear brake balancing away from its stock heavy front bias, so that
a given level of retardation can be achieved without asking so much of it
to be provided by the fronts, and a higher level of retardation can be
achieved before the fronts lock. However, even here, you stop boosting the
rear brakes at the point where they tend to lock first, because that will
cause you to spin.

I completely agree about not causing loss of steering by causing/permitting
breakaway at the front. I've used the technique you describe for the same
reason, but it can cause a problem if you lock the rears and the slide
becomes uncontrolled. Luckily, since you will not have broken the fronts
loose at that point, you still have some ability to steer out of the
incipient spin.
