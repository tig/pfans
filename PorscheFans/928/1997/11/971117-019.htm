Hi All,

I just discovered PorscheFans! Great!!

I recently bought an 86 928S/32valve/Auto/White/120K and very well
maintained.  This is my first 928, but I also have an 83 944 which I have
owned and maintained for a number of years. I am mechanically adept, and have
always done all the maintenance and rebuilding on my cars (except auto trans
work) and a couple aircraft. I purchased the factory 928 manuals, and they
have already helped me through some tough spots. I'm looking forward to
working on, and improving my 928.

My questions:
1. I have used BFG Comp T/A HR4 tires on my 944 and like them for good wet
road performance (I live in Portland, Oregon where it rains a lot),
predictable characteristics when pushed to the edge, quiet, reasonable cost,
and long tread life.

Now it is time for new tires on my 928. It now has VR rated tires (can't
determine the brand) and they have very high road noise. My wife does not
like to ride in the 928 due to the road/tire noise. I don't want to make the
mistake of getting another noisy tire. I would like to stay with the BFG Comp
T/A type as I have been pleased with them in the past. Does anyone know how
much noisier the BFG Comp T/A VR4 tires might be than the BFG Comp T/A HR4
tires? I have called the BFG company with this question and they didn't know.
I usually drive as fast as road conditions and traffic permit, and love curvy
two lane roads away from trucks, traffic, and cops.

I am aware that the 928 specifies V rated tires, but I could give up some
performance for a quieter ride. I won't spend much time at the 130 mph max
rating of the H tires anyway. My son has an 83 928 with the BFG Comp T/A HR4
tires and they seem to work fine, even during spirited twisty mountain road
driving.

2. I want to install a performance chip in my 86. There are a couple
different makers of these chips with widely different prices. Does anyone
have information on which chip brand works the best?

3. I want to eventually upgrade the motor to at least 5.0 L S4 performance,
but can't find much specific how-to information regarding those type mods for
the '86 motor. I have checked Devek, and 928 international, but the
information either wasn't there or I missed it. Maybe a book exists.

Thanks very much for any help with these questions.
