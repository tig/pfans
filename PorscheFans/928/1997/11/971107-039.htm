Tom, with regard to your post on spins, I think the physics of swapping
ends under braking goes like this: If the rear end has a lower
coefficient of friction than the front end, it will come around on you.
As we all know, except for certain particular instances involving loose
gravel or light snow, a locked and skidding tire has a lower coefficient
of friction than a non-locked tire (hence the push to ABS in recent
years to shorten stopping distances by preventing lockup). Thus, under
braking, if you lock the rears, you will tend to swap ends.
Two thoughts in support of this: Hollywood stunt men create the huge
rear-end slides going around corners in the chase scenes (even with
front-wheel drive cars!) by utilizing hand-brake turns, though I admit
they are not using the brakes at the same time, just the hand-brake, and
they are turning. Secondly, you may remember that when Detroit first
starting introducing ABS on their trucks, at first it was on the rear
only. Why? 'cause that was the most important end for accident
prevention, especially in a pick-up which can have widely varying weight
loading on the rear tires, resulting in vastly different physics.
Any other more cogent thoughts than this from anyone?
