Hi you all..

I know some of you remember my story about the power loss I had with my 
"baby". I also told you I would tell you guys if I would find the 
problem I would tell you about it. 
It was nothing else then a bad throttle valve switch.
More important is , that some people really serious have try to help me
with this problem. One guy in particular and that is Frank a. Flores
from san diego   (or something).
He had to come over to Europe for business and Frank stayed at my 
place (and my wifes, ) He brought not only one suit case clothes allong, 
but another one filled with 928 parts, workshopmanuels 9 volumes
included. We worked on the car for two days, and every thing what Frank 
saw on that trip to Holland was a 928 on wooden blocks.
I met the man over the porschefans chat box. so you can see what that 
can bring you.   Frank,   thanks.  and I hope you will drive
your white bullet again soon.
