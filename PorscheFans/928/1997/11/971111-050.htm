Hi Chuck!

Yes others have noted non-digest mode is history when re-subscribing but
the emails resume in non-digest mode anyways!?!  The last resort of
course is to manually seek out the archives for the day...

Thanks for the link to my webpage also.  Boy I need to update sometime
soon, ie. Kim's final race results (WINs everywhere!), etc. plus one
*super huge surprise* that I'm struggling just to keep my mouth shut
right now!!!

Anyhoo - hope to see you back on the list soon!
Phil
ps.  shirts sent!  Sorry for the delay, I normally turn orders around
immediately!
