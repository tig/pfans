I have just recently joined the 'list' and already have become quite
addicted to reviewing the daily exchanges. My thanks and appreciation to
those persons who had the will and devotion in establishing and maintaining
such a worthwhile and much needed forum.

After 2.5 years of 928 ('85 32-valve auto.) ownership, I would like to share
some of the experiences, observations, and reflections that this car has
generated.
I got the 928 when it had 50km and it now has 76km. The car is stock except
for K&N filter and lower temp thermostat and fan switch. I use Syntec 5W50
and also synthetic tranny fluid and differential oil. Tires are Michelin
XGTV. I can honestly say that this car has not missed a beat and hasn't
given me one moment of grief while in my possession. Everything works as it
should and the car is as solid as a vault. I have owned several Benzes and
BMW's over the years, but the 928's superb balance of performance, safety,
reliability, and just outright driving pleasure and satisfaction, is second
to none. For performance, the only car that comes close in my experience is
an Aston Martin V8 that I had some years ago. (Still miss the right-now
response of those 4 dual-throat Webers!) The only thing that I find annoying
is the lack of control over 1st gear and I hope to get that revalved this
winter.
(The sum is greater than the parts - even though the parts have greater
value than the sum!)

Although the 928 is a true Porsche, for a variety of reasons it was never
fully accepted as such by the majority of "motoring enthusiasts". Porsche
had originally intended to make the 928 their 'flagship', but in the course
of time and developments it seems that the 928 has been pushed to the
fringes of the marque. Compared with other models, especially 911, there is
generally little offered in the way of literature, development, upgrades,
hi-perf parts, etc. The exceptions being Devek, 928 Int'l, et al. Thank God
for them! (And maybe that's all we need.)
Maybe it's just me, but I had this 'fringe' feeling even when I joined the PCA
(Canada West) for a year. Yes, some of the events were fun, and there was
socializing, etc. But when it came to the tech stuff, the talk and sessions
invariably were dominated by the significanly weighted 911 group. It seemed
that we didn't have much more in common (car-wise) than the Porsche badge.
Even 'Panorama' makes seldom reference to the 928.(Nice article July/97 though).
Same goes for 'Excellence', 'Porsche World', etc.

But that's OK! If it's only us 928ers that can appreciate these magnificent
machines, then so be it! Great to find a venue to share 928 ideas, info, and 
experiences!

BTW - does anyone have experience with, or comments on, Devek's suggestion
of advancing the valve timing on the 4-valvers?

Cheers everyone,
