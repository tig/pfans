Aha! An admission that the porky, front-end-heavy (820 kg/760 kg) late-
model 928 understeers! Of course the svelte, balanced (750/750) early
models don't suffer from the same problem. I suppose there are
compensations, though. I will admit to using a bit less pressure n
the front tires (with R1's) to even things out.

I still haven't figured out where all the extra front-end weight in
the later cars comes from. The engines are quoted as having almost
the same weight (264 kg vs 261 kg), there are a few extra bits and
pieces in the newer cars, but 150 lb worth? Where is it? What am
I missing?
