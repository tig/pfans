Hi Sharkers!
Back from Czech Rep. for my vacation (Prague) and after reading the cow
post
<<<How about a black as night 1000+ lb angus cow? >>>
I will mention a very lucky friends Corvette vs. Cow story...skip over
if you are in no mood for a story.. :)
Scene:  Tremonton, Utah. Thiokol Highway.. 2 am..
Friend and friend are booking it  home after a long day of computering,
when passenger friend sees farmer on side of road waving arms.  Comments
to driver friend "Do you know that guy, or something?"
As driver friend looks over to see the farmer, they both hear a loud
"schwrump" sound and driver shouts "We hit something!" Passenger looks
out window and sees TOPS of pickup trucks parked on the side of the
road..... Passenger has time to say "No, we are in the air!" before the
car lands, exploding the front of the tupperware car (oops, sorry) and
skidding to a stop. Both guys get out and, due to a long day, and being
unhurt, break into the unstoppable laughs, whereupon they are taken to a
hospital because "They must be in shock to act like that!"  What
happened was : Cow was already dead from previous encounter with a
pickup truck, and all the locals were trying to figure out how to get it
off the road.  The only thing that saved this friends life (probably)
was the amazing luck that the cow's legs were in just the right position
to act as ramps for the wheels, and at 90mph, the vette went up, the
undercarriage scraping on the cow and got (by witnesses estimates) 10
vertical feet of air!  This impact rolled the cow over 3 or 4 times and
it ended up in the ditch!  True story!

The reason I posted it, besides entertainment value, was this:  If a
standing deer/cow/moose/whatever is 4-6 feet tall, how tall is a dead or
sleeping one in your path?  500lbs of deer at bumper height at <fast>
speeds could be painful.
Please don't out drive your lights at night!
(LL... With your enhanced lighting, have you calc'd your "hypothetical"
"safe" night max-speed?)

Later!!
