Brian: 
	My definition of danger is travelling on the same road as you at the
same time in either direction. Other drivers have the right to expect
reward for defensive driving, but how would one defend against you?  The
closure rates at the speeds you're talking about puts us in the class
with deer.  "Of course, I don't want to hit one" I think you said. Do
the track.  You'll like it!
