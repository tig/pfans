Rob, thanks for sending me your 16:08 e-mail directly.  This 'gram 
should put us all on the same sheet of music.  I couldn't find your
e-mail address, so I just posted both my previous missives knowing that
you would read them and take the appropriate action.

By now you should have my post from earlier today.  I agree that there
is no reason that the Left-Coasters and the Yankees should have all the
928 fun.  I was unaware that there were anywhere near the 2-dozen
sandsharks in Tucson you refer to!  I've only seen a few others.

No need for envy, bro'.  You may have paid more, but you have a late '86
with the big brakes.  Not that the earlier brakes aren't up to all but
the most severe abuse...

I'm still driving the Michelin Sport XGT V's that were on the car when
we bought it.  They're down to minimum tread, but still gripping like
glue. Tell me again the tire model you run on your 'shark.  (Anyone else
who'd like to chime in on tires for stock 16" wheels and mostly hwy,
some sporty driving is welcome.)

Radmacher did a 4-wheel alignment on our car when the new Bilsteins were
installed 1200 miles before we bought it.  The charge was $130.  More
than Midas, for sure, but I suspect worth it.

I don't know if we have the LSD.  How does one tell (other than the time
tested, and not always reliable (at least with American iron) technique
of jacking one rear tire in the air and spinning it)?

Great minds must run in the same gutter!  Let us indeed get together for
some sandshark mayhem.  What do you think of my idea for a double
fun-run followed by food, etc?  Suggestions?

By the way, do you all know that C.A.R.S. (of Pony Express 100 fame) is
considering a "Three Points to Why, AZ" run to be held, tentatively,
March and November, starting in 1998?  (Three Points is just west of
Ryan Field - about 20 miles west of Tucson on highway 86.)  According to
a county supervisor I was speaking with, they lack only final San Xavier
Tribal Council approval (their Casino is a major sponsor...) and ADOT's
approval of their safety plan to run this coming March.  With delays it
could push back to November.  We need to support this big-time!

Tucson - it's a dry heat!
