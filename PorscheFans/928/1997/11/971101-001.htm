To all my American 928 Friends,

I have found that it takes quite a bit of time to find the right mechanic
that has indepth knowledge of our precious cars.  This being said, I can
recommend Ron Greene of Campbell garage in Montreal who runs at $65 Cdn per
our and is very reasonable.  The reason I am suggesting a trip to Montreal
is that I have noticed that throughtout the NorthEastern US the mechanic
rates are comparable with Canadian ones in absolute terms, however once you
factor in the currency exchange, the US dollars go much further !  I know
it is a hassle to travel, but Montreal is a really nice place to see.

Another possibility is the local porsche club magazines usually have a list
of "approved" garages to prep cars for the driver ed events.  These guys
are generally good at what they do based on the simple fact that the see
alot of Porsches HOWEVER The all important question to ask is : How many
928`s do you service and can you give me references - You will quickly see
that the true 928 mechanic will gladly provide references.
