Tom,
	What I am saying is if the oil has leaked out the shock, it was no longer 
damping the springs movements and the weight of the car was riding on just the 
springs. This was the case with my car it had 71k when I made the change. The 
soft springs will make the Koni shocks work harder and i.e. wear out faster.  I 
had this problem with my Audi, plus the springs lowered the car and increased 
handling.
Old 928's never die we just make them go faster.

Scott,

On 10-24, you wrote,

My question is, I'm just curious, what do you mean exactly?  I've never heard 
this before.  Are you saying that whenever you change shocks you should change 
springs too?  Are you saying that if they leak, the shock oil will weaken the 
spring?  Are you saying?  Do you mean all of the above?  I don't quite follow 
your reasoning, please elaborate further, I'm very interested.

Anyone else?  Comments?
