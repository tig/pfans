Hi!

Does anyone have any idea where I might find the original black and white
checkerboard cloth to re-do my seat inserts?  I was told by World Upholstery
that it was available through the dealer only---that was the main reason I
called them yesterday, only to get reprimanded for owning a gray market car.
 I have made quite a few calls, but have been told that this stuff was
extinct for about 10 years now.  I have a complete mint interior out of an
86, but would rather keep the funky original stuff if there was any way to. 

Any known sources of importers of parts for the gray market cars?  Any and
all help is greatly appreciated!

Thanks!
