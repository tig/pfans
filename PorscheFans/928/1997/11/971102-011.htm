Sorry about the long delay in my response.  I absolutely *HATE* the
"daily digest" mode and it just a pain in the ass for me.


Now on the camera side of the issue, if you get a small camera head that
you can mount "just about anywhere" you'll need some kind of separate
recording device.  Some camcorders are A/V input capable but a lot are
not.  If you have one that is then you can get a camera head with just
two wires that run to the power supply and one to the camcorder.  The
camcorder is now just a slave unit or just a recording device, (ie. you
are not using the lens on the camcorder.)  This (camcorder/recording
device) can then be seat belted or mounded in where ever it's safe and
virtually vibration free.  The camera head power supply on my setup is a
stand alone video battery for Matsushita made camcorders.  They are
commonly used for all Matsushita (Panasonic, Magnavox, Quasar, GE, Curtis
Mathis, Sylvania) full size VHS camcorders and a lot of cellular bag
phones.  They can be had for cheap and supply 12v and are rated at
2000-2300mAh.  This will run the camera head easily for a full day.  The
recording device should have it's own battery supply or a 12v adaptor
made from the manufacturer.


If your camcorder doesn't have A/V input capabilities then you have to
buy a small VCR like a Sony Video Watchman that has it.  Or replace the
camcorder you have with one that has that option.  The Watchman has an
advantage of having a screen to monitor your status when you're setting
the camera up or when playing back you tapes.  Also confirmation that
everything is running when you think it is.


<paraindent><param>left</param>*Where did the "non-digest" option go
to?*

</paraindent>

Next issue is the audio.  I use a Radio Shack Stereo Amplified Listener
for $22.00.  CAT# 33-1093A  It's a stereo mic that raises it's mic level
to line level to go into a line input of a camcorder or other recording
device.  Do not attempt to plug a mic into the "mic input" jack when
using an external camera head.  It won't work.


<paraindent><param>left</param>*We want "non-digest"!*

</paraindent>

For you guys that are mounting a camcorder itself as the entire package,
I would recommend either 8mm, Hi Band 8mm, or digital video.  They're the
lightest and highest quality.  The use of a full size camcorder is
extremely dangerous due to inertia as well as a huge blind spot for the
driver.  VHS-C sucks due to the lack of recording time and lower quality.
 In a previous post by Kurt Gibble, I agree 100% as to using a car
adapter instead of a camera mounted battery.  You want to make the
camcorder as light as possible.



<paraindent><param>left</param>*I hate the daily digest mode.*

</paraindent>

Also, I personally would NEVER use a plastic tripod head to mount a
camera in a moving vehicle.  Additional tie downs or not, it's just not
worth the risk.  Get a Bogen Head made of metal.  You have a safer and a
more stable mount for your camera.  Then use the additional safety straps
or tie downs.  It's a few bucks more but just like our 928's & Valentine
1's,  "There is no Substitute" for the right stuff.


<paraindent><param>left</param>*The daily digest mode is a pain for=20
me.*

</paraindent>

An additional accessory that is a MUST is a video fisheye lens (full
frame).  Otherwise it looks like tunnel vision.


<paraindent><param>left</param>*Bring back "non-digest"!!!*

</paraindent>

If you guys/gals want more info, just let me know.


BTW, let's have the return of the list option:  "non-digest" again!

An idea I had was to use one of those remote mount "spy" lenses - low

quality image but very compact and easily taped to a seat, etc.   =20
Maybe

Vincent can post a hi-quality lens & source for us?
