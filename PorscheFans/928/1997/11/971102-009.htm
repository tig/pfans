I'd like to express much gratitude to Mike Mitchell for instructing me
at the season final GGR AX at Dublin, CA.  Though it was only my second
AX ever, Mike was extremely patient, encouraging and fearless during our
two runs.  Heck, I even got a thrill ride in his 944T to see how to do
it right!

Was his instruction of value?  Let's say this:  On my third and final
run, Mike left it to me and I chose to run solo and promised to make him
proud.  During the course I could hear his voice echo in the cockpit
"tap the brakes... throttle!... unwind, unwind.. throttle!"  I could
also feel right where I was blowing it so it was a definate surprise to
collect a timeslip that revealed my best time of the day by more than
1.50 seconds!

Ok, this is enough to turn me into a morning person just to get more
runs in!  Even during the drive home I replayed the course over and over
in my head trying to find that elusive best line.  I know I can do
better!

Thanks again Mike - you are an inspiration to all us newbies.  See you
next year at the PCA AX schools!
