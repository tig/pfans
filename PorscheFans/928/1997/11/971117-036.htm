Dear Ed,

Thanks for your comment.  It may have seemed that I was implying that
changing the proportioning valve would reduce front brake pressure, which you
pointed out is not the case.  In my original statement, I did say that the
valve would reduce pressure to the front, but in relation to the rear.

The hydraulic pressure applied to the front brakes is determined (obviously)
by how much pressure the driver applies to the brake pedal.  If a
proportioning valve with a greater rearward bias is used, the driver will
have to apply additional pressure to the brake pedal to achieve the same
pressure at the front, since a greater portion of the pressure is being
diverted to the rear.  That's what I was trying to get at when I said
pressure to the front brakes would be reduced in relation to the rear
brakes...assuming the driver didn't compensate by increasing total pedal
pressure.

Ciao!
