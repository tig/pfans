    Well, my curiosity was aroused by the "40 HP for every mile per
    hour above 180" post, so I read through todays 928 digest instead
    of just deleting it as I usually do [no offense; it's just that I
    don't own a 928, so the traffic on this list doesn't really
    interest me much].

    Anyway, I came across this:

    Absolutely untrue; the car's stable when the FRONT wheels are
    locked.

    Try this experiment:  Take a toy car (any toy car; even a
    Matchbox car will do) and lock its front wheels by taping them to
    the fenders or something.  Now put it on a flat sheet of wood and
    tilt the wood until the car starts to slide forward.  Notice that
    the car slides in a straight line.

    Now free the front wheels and lock the rear wheels, then try the
    experiment again.  Notice that the car spins.

    Yeah, but you're missing an important point:  The locked wheels
    have LESS lateral grip than the rolling ones.  Therefore, the car
    wants to pivot about the wheels that AREN'T locked.

    "Braking 101", indeed.
