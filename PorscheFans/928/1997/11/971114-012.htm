Well two things, a comment and a question/idea.

1st of all, after telling you guys about all my talking my way out of
citations message, I really have to say that when I am driving down the
freeway now I get really nervous thinking karma is gonna give me a swift
kick in the butt. (Although no cop has so much as even given my ratty old
nissan pickup a second look.. even though I drive it almost as fast as any
of my other cars)

Secondly, I have the rear seats out of my 928, and I have been slowly
looking for a decent set of replacements. (Mine have bad upholstery and it
seems more cost effective to get some from a dismantler around here instead
of getting them redone)
Well my thoughts on the subject are that although it looks really bad
without the seats back there, I really dont want rear seats. I mean I didnt
buy this car to be driving anyone but myself and a date around. If my
friends and I want to go out for a night on the town they can take their
own wheels. So My idea was, why not build two custom speaker enclosures? I
figure two 12" subs would be perfect right there, pointing straight up
(maybe tilted back about 6degrees toward the hatch) And the top of the
enclosures could be flush with the back area. I would have lots of room in
the spare tire compartment for my AMPS, and the door speakers I already
have (4 rockford fosgate punch 40s) could fill out the mids nicely. Then
its just a matter of slapping some plate tweeters on some flat surface
where they project well.

I am not interested in winning any contests. I am just serious about my
sound. (I like it clean and loud)

I imagine the box could be bolted in at the bolting point for the seatbelt
harness, and of course the center console would remain intact. (Especially
since I spent 3 days re-doing mine personally)

Has anyone ever thought of this/drawn up blueprints? There are a lot of
custom enclosure places around here in San Diego.. I am envisioning about
$700 to have some boxes built. The first one would be tricky but the second
one could just be mirrored. The boxes in my experience would probably be a
bit small if they were only as deep as from the bottom of the seat to flush
with the rear area, but who knows what some of these guys can do? Has
anyone ever had experience with mobilworks? I know they make custom boxes
and people I talk to in the store are generally pretty happy.
