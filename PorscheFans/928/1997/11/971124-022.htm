To: Leonard....

Thanks for the offer, but the car is staying with me.  It's the temperamental
child I never had.  Besides, I've got a lot of BS&T into the car after 2+
years of ownership.  And I did mean to say #9, which overshadows items 1
through 8 (for most owners anyway).  By the way, I'd venture that the 928
parts-to-car price ratio is well in excess of the Beetle's 30:1 ratio; and
I'm talking about used parts, not factory new.  So if you ever decide that
your non-running 928 isn't worth fixing, dismantle it and you'll come out way
ahead of the game instead of trying to sell it in one piece.

To Andy (need4speed)...

Not really trying to discourage any future owners, just trying to make a
point, tongue-in-cheek, about the trials and tribulations of 928 ownership.
 It would be good for everyone (dedicated 928 owners and owners-to-be alike)
to understand, going in, the real cost of ownership since it is in no one's
interest (particularly those of us with 928s) to have unhappy owners running
around.  Let's face it, the more these cars get passed from one owner to the
next the less maintenance (usually) they receive...until they fall into the
lap of one of the dedicated few for resurrection from the almost dead.
 Whenever I talk about the 928 to friends of mine who ask, I always discuss
both sides of 928 ownership...the good and the bad.

To Rob...

You are absolutely right about the "there is no substitute" bull.  A
marketing slogan is no justification for blind acceptance that whatever
Porsche does must be correct because they are "Porsche".  They are just as
susceptible to design and manufacturing process problems as the next guy,
maybe more so since they have a large "fanatical" buyer base which has a
tendency to look the other way when problems occur, which would not be
tolerated by other owner groups.

To All...

If we can't criticize our cars, then who can?  Maybe if the "original" owners
of these cars had been more critical of the factory, the cars would still be
in production today.  I can't help but think that a major reason (not the
only reason) for the car's disappearance from the market was due to a lot of
uncorrected problems that plagued the car up until its termination.  I have
talked to many 911 owners who said that they had heard from "former" 928
owners that the cars were maintenance nightmares (i.e., frequent and costly).
 It doesn't take too many of these stories going around before you kill a
potential market (especially when the car is a expensive as the 928 was when
new).  If Porsche had made a systematic effort to rid the 928 of all of its
problems, I think they might have been able to develop a decent market for
the car.

When you ask people in the know (like certain companies unaffiliated with the
factory) about problems you are having and they say "they all do that", there
is a real problem.  It's one thing if you are told that "the factory
corrected the problem after the first couple of years, and they have a better
part to replace yours...".  At least that indicates a willingness by the
manufacturer to recognize it has a problem and then take corrective action.
 If the manufacturer decides it is too expensive to come up with a new design
and the necessary tooling to produce it, then they at least have an
obligation to provide the owners of the product with replacement parts at a
low cost to offset their frequent replacement.  An example...Honda
(motorcycles) recognized that the alternator design on one of their bikes was
failure prone due to both the design and the installation environment.
 Rather than attempt a costly redesign effort of the installation, they
provided replacement alternators at dealer cost to owners with failed parts.
 If Porsche took a similar approach, it would go a long way towards
mitigating the high cost of ownership due to the abnormal failure rate of
inadequately designed (or manufactured) parts.  Think about this...we have a
digest request for help in solving the interior quarter panel problem for a
car that was in production for more than 15 years.  We should not have to
solve this problem, should we?  You should be able to call the dealer and
have him tell you that Kit P/N XYZ at a cost of $20 can be used to repair the
panels...or that you can buy replacements at dealer cost since the
replacements will eventually do the same thing.  Just my opinion of customer
satisfaction.
