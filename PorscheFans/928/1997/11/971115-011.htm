Hi all!

Since I haven't since postings about engine coolant temp issues in the past
few weeks or so, I guess it's save to add my  $.02

Car: 1990 S4, 75k miles, had about a year.

When I first bought the car, the temp gage would be parked at just under the
210 deg F tick mark, rain or shine, traffic or freeway, A/C or not. Having
talked and listened to various 928 people, I figured that was a little high.
Looking in the factory repair manual, the stock thermostat starts to open at
about 83 deg C and fully opens at about 98 deg C. I figured the car was
running with the thermostat close to or at fully opened since 98 deg C is
about 210 deg F. Talking to my mechanic (>30 years with Porsche) about
reducing the temp,he told me thermostats do regulate the coolant temperature.
I thought they were just either opened or closed. He said most modifications
to lower the coolant temp would be just nulled out by the thermostat. He
suggested getting a thermostat with a lower range. And Devek just so happened
to have a 75 deg C one, with all the orings for about $25. What a deal. The
car now does run about 10 deg cooler guesstimated at the gage.
I also took the opportunity to wire the front vents open to evaluate their
affect on the coolant temp. With the vents wired open, the temp varies from
about 180 to 200. With the vents operating, the temp varies from 190 to 200.
 I figured (maybe incorrectly) that the smaller the temperature excursions
the better and left the vents operating.

I did buy the Water Wetter, but haven't put it in yet. My thinking (again,
maybe incorrectly) is that if the WW does reduce the thermal resistance
between the block and the coolant, and assuming classical termal analysis,
the block would not have to get as hot to dump the same amount of heat into
the water (less thermal resistance equals less delta T with a given q or
heat). The water temp would not change on the gage, since the temp is
regulated by the thermostat (another assumption). But the engine block would,
theoretically, run cooler.
WHEW!

Sorry about all the rambling.

Any comments, thoughts, corrections or differing opinions welcomed. 

I hope this topic hasn't been beaten to death yet, I'm a fairly new
subscriber.

Thanks All,

John Weber
