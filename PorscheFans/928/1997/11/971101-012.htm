On 31 Oct  I wrote that my headlights were flickering and asked for a 
possible cause/solutions.  Dave Nicholson wrote and suggested that 
there could be a faulty ground connnection.  I checked all that I could 
find and everything seems fine.  While pondering the problems I was 
leaning against the open drivers door  and I noticed that when a slight 
movement of the car occured the lights would flicker.  A small 
vibration would suggest that something was loose.  I reached in  to 
turn the lights off and I came to the conclusion that the switch may be 
a fault.  Touching it slightly caused the lights to flicker.  This car  
has only 51K miles. Is it possible  to have  this switch go bad so 
soon.  Is this a common problem.  By the way, while looking under the 
instrument cluster I found a black plastic disk about the size of a 1/2 
dollar.  It rotates but what does it do.  Right under the left  corner. 
 No memtion of this item in my owners book.  The car is an 87 S4.  And 
please don't laugh at me I was a 911 owner for years and have never had 
something so sophisticated as this 928
.
