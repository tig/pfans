Apart from incidents on the track I have one really memorable "spinning down the highway" story. (Doesn't
everyone...)

We were heading down country for a car show many years ago.  I had a Lotus Esprit (which at that stage
was one of about a dozen in the country) and a friend of mine had a 308 GTB and we'd been asked to
take them down to a small provincial town to help add some exotica to the local car clubs fund raising
car show.  

It's about 5 hours drive on country roads and Ken had disappeared off in the Ferrari at far greater speeds
than the Esprit would do.  My wife, Ali, was driving and we were sitting on just over 100 mph in the Lotus
when we came over the brow of a hill just as a three Maori guys in a truck with a dead cow on the back
pulled out onto the road in front of us.  (For you Americans, Maori were the inhabitants of New Zealand
before the British arrived and built roads and bars.  They are pretty much like native Hawaiians.)

Keep in mind we weren't on a multi-lane highway, but a country road and there was a car coming down the
other side of the valley so we couldn't just pull out and go around the truck. Ali hit the brakes hard... she
must have damn near used both feet!... and the nose of the car buried itself into the road but the back of the
truck just kept getting closer.  I could read the numbers on the diff and was bracing myself for the impact
when one wheel hit a slick patch on the road and we went into a huge slide.  She caught the first swing
of the pendulum and then around we went.  My view went "fence, road, ditch, truck, fence, road, truck, ditch...."

We came to rest with the front of the car j..u..s..t.. touching the fence, facing back the way we'd come,
our view of the figure-eight black marks back up the road mysteriously cloaked by thick, black tyre smoke.
The lady in the car coming the other way stopped to see if we were alright and by this time Ali had got
out of the car (the front wheel was in a soft ditch) and said yeah, but she wasn't driving anymore.

We changed seats and as I was about to back the Lotus back out onto the road the truck arrived back and
the guys jumped out.  They were a lot bigger than me.  Agricultural types.  And they were saying things
like "What the f___ do you think you're doing?!" and "You f___ing prick, you think you own the f___ing
road."

Figuring that they were probably going to attack me with the dead cow I didn't stop to explain what the
f___ I thought I was doing, or even that it wasn't me that was driving.  I mean - I knew the Esprit would
outrun the truck, after all.
