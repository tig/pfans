Dear Marvin and fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

Earlier this year my luggage area cover gave up the ghost. It had started to
get tears that looked like a cat was clawing at it. The cost to replace with
OEM was about $900. Since this is not a performance item, I decided to find
another way and save some money in the process.

The original material is a cotton and stretch material weave. the cotton had
deteriorated and was not supporting the other material, thus the tears. I
decided to replace the material with LYCRA (a spandex fabric). It stretches
in all directions, is lighter than the OEM and is impervious to sun-light
(the apparent cause of the OEM deterioration). The cost for the material was
$35 including tax. I took it to an automotive reupholsterer. They used the
original hardware and included a vinyl material for the edge trim. Their
cost was $165. The grand total then was $200. As a PCA Concours judge, I can
tell that it's not OEM, but it is so close to original that I doubt many
others could tell.

Happy motoring. Ed
