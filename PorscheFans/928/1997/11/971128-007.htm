>>In response to what are you missing in your earlier 928 that we have in the
>>S4's.
>>
>>ABS
Say 20 lb for the hydraulic unit.
>>Big 9004 head lights
Negligible weight differnce.
>>Slats for the radiator
10 lb.
>>Maybe a trans cooler depending on what tranny you have (auto's have them)
I used numbers quoted for the manual transmission.
>>Body side moulding
Negligible weight.
>>Bigger brakes and wheels (quite heavy)
20 lb for brakes, front wheels are the same.
>>
>>I am sure there are some more that I am missing but that is a good start on
>>the way to 150 lbs.
Nope, I still seem to be missing 100 lb, even being (I think) generous
with the weights above. Understand that I wrote the original note just
to help convince myself (and others) that there are some advantages
to the older cars - "sour grapes" is the operative term here.
>>
>>And yes they do understeer at the limit.  NOT in day to day types of driving
>>in general, but 928's (and every other car on the race track for that matter)
>>understeers in those slow speed corners I was playing with the throttle on.
>>
I absolutely agree. It's all a matter of degree of understeer; a car that
oversteered with neutral throttle on slow corners would be diabolical,
at least.
