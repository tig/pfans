I have a 1988 928S4, automatic transmission, that I'm thinking about
putting he Autothority performance chips into. Do the chips really make a
significant difference? I also wanted to know where these chips are located
in the car, and how can I tell if the chips presently in the car are the
Porsche originals, or if a previous owner may have already changed them.
Thanks.

I have performance chips in my '87 S4, and I have barely noticed the
difference. I am fortunate to have a father who also owns an '87 S4, and I
drove them back to back one afternoon. You could hardly notice (if at all)
the difference between the stock and chipped S4. It is my opinion that you
should do what Leonard Laub suggested - take the car to a place where they
can tune the chips / computer for optimum horsepower. I have heard this
really works. BTW, the chips are located in the passenger footwell in boxes
attached to the wall of the car. There is a leather strap with a button on
it, when you remove it, the corner piece is exposed and the boxes are in
that area. It's a tough job to do, since you have to unscrew the boxes from
their mountings - easier said than done. The upgraded chips, if you have
them, should have "Autothority" or "Superchips" emblazoned upon them. If I
was you, I would go with headers, the performance is virtually guaranteed
(30 HP), and there is no voodoo which needs to be performed to ge them to
show results. Methinks they are $695.00 from Devek.
