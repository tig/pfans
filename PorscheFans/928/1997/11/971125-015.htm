John, hope all is well.
I thought I'd heard of it before Porsche ownership and the "Project 928"
book, but perhaps not. The "Performance Portfolio" book also mentions the
term and says that many years ago (this was a 1978' article) an editor of
"Motor" magazine coined the phrase "lift-off  tuck-in" to describe the
phenomenon where, a sudden change to oversteer, caused by a mid-corner
lifting or braking, is very dangerous. (ie...the back of the car passes the
front)
In the Project 928 book it states that Porsche engineers questioned "how the
tuck-in effect could occur when there was toe-in?"  So, to me, it sounds like
they equated "tuck-in" to tire posistion, and also to the undesirable
oversteer itself. 
My perception of it is,  that "tuck-in" is the "effect" of the load change,
and the "cause" of the oversteer. 
I'd guess the phrase "lift-off  tuck-in" was an old-fashioned way of saying
"lift throttle oversteer", or at least a predecessor of the term.
