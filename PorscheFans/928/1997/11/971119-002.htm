What about no's 1 - 11?

Seriously, this is a tough call for you to make.  Given the market it is
a tough sell to all but the most dedicated & serious of 928 collectors,
unless you can document notable previous ownership or use and/or it is
in pristine condition.  There would be nothing to prevent you from doing
some go-fast mod's on the engine which don't materially affect it's
appearance but would allow it to be more interesting to drive and
probably increase it's value in that respect.  

Go price an early Ferrari / Lambo / et al and then go figure!  

It is quite possible that someday you might get the last laugh.
