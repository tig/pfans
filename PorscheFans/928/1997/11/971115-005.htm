Hi,

Since PORSCHE is the featured mark at next August's Historic Races at
Laguna Seca Raceway near Monterey, CA I just thought I'd recommend that
anyone remotely interested in going make reservations ASAP.=20

=46or the recent FIA GT and World SportsCar racing in October we stayed =
at
the Monterey Marina Travelodge (not a fantastic place, but more than
adequate and very convenient to the rear track entrance).  I made
reservations a few months in advance through my travel agent and got a
corporate discount rate of $59 per night.  Those that paid the "normal"
weekend rate paid $109.

Well, yesterday I tried to make reservations at the same Travelodge for
next August and the best rate I could get was $139!  I feel lucky to have
gotten a room.  Everything else my agent looked at was sold out.  All I
can say is "good luck" and reserve now!
