First:

Anyone out there ever had their rear seats re-upholstered? 
Anyone out there have used rear seats for sale?

(Remember, I'm looking for solutions for my _rear_ seats, so the black leather
front sport seats won't do! ;-)


Second:

I enjoy almost all posts as well as "chewing the fat" with many of the 928'ers,
but some of us keep posting and including "-----Original Message-----" along
with all of the responses up until that time period. Wow! That's alot of
redundancy. 

Please, if you're going to post, take a little time to "[snip]" the body of
the messages that you're responding to. I mean, leave just enough to make it
clear about what your response refers to. That _should_ only take one or two
lines of that post to accomplish. Maybe less.

I'm not trying to be the "bandwidth" policeman here. I really don't care
about bandwidth. Long posts are great when they are entertaining, informational
AND ORIGINAL. I mean, wouldn't it suck if I were to take a thread, repost it
in its entirety and _only_ add the two words, "Interesting point" ?

The problem I have is that the digest gets very cluttered and harder for me to
read when I have to scan reposts just to find any additional words of wisdom.

Am I alone?
