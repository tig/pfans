     Hello, everybody.  I need some advice.  I saw an ad in the newspaper for
a 1981 Porsche 928 (at Northwest Investment Cars for those of you in the
Portland, OR area) for $5995.  When I called the dealer about it, they told
me that it is drivable, but the transmission is slipping.  Otherwise, it is
supposed to run good and is in good shape.  What I'm wondering is Should I
buy this car?  I desperately want a 928 and I can afford this one, but I
can't go over about $1000 worth of repairs until late January/Early February.
 
     Does anybody know the average cost for auto transmission repairs/rebuild
or the cost of the parts so I can do it myself?  Or, is this a semi common
problem with a relatively cheap fix (low transmission fluid I hope)?  The
dealer sells a lot of Porsches, so I imagine they have correctly identified
the problem areas.
     I haven't looked at/driven the car yet, I plan to do it later today.
 I'll post more details when I get back.  
     For the 928 owners on a budget:  Based on your experience, should I walk
away from this one and wait for another to come along in better shape, or
take the plunge now?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks In
advance.
