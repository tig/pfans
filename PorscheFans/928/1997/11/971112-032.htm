John,

Instead of little short studs it has bolts holding the spacers on - bolted in
to the threads where the studs usually go.  I haven't actually pulled them
off to look closely.  I haven't even had the wheels off.  I didn't want to get
my hands dirty...

OK! I believe! Though I will argue that spacers like mine are
probably a lot more common, hence easier/cheaper to get. Does
your hub have little short studs holding the spacer, so that
they don't interfere with the wheel? If so, either approach
means new studs, so that's kind of a wash.

As to the effect on handling, I agree that the spacers would
reduce oversteer a bit. For the same torque around the
longitudinal axis, you have less weight transfer from inner
to outer rear wheel because of the longer lever arm, therefore
better total grip on the more evenly-loaded tires. Of course
the effect is probably too small to be detectable by any of
us ham-fisted 928 drivers anyway.
