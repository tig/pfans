Thanks, Andrew - CarTest is very good and I guess it takes ALL the guesswork
out of things.  What started me going on this was that the Auckland Car Club
is running a flying kilometre event in a couple of weeks and I am trying to decide
whether to run the 928 - I wanted to simulate optimum take-offs and work out
what reasonable speed I could expect to get clocked at with 2km run up, 1km
flying.  (ie - if it's under 160mph I won't bother!)

A couple of things worry me about this program (having just spent an hour playing
on it) though.  

1) Is dropping the clutch at 2000 rpm REALLY the quickest way to get a 928 off
the line??  And is it really going to wheelspin for over a second at that rpm?? (I
guess I can answer that by going out and trying it - anyone else know?)

2) My car does an indicated 100mph in 3rd and I know my speedo is pretty close
to correct.  Yet the program says only 90mph in 3rd based on the ratios that my
car is supposed to have.  The program seems accurate - so what the hell is in
my gearbox and diff!!???

    Philip:

    Search the web for a program called "CARTEST.EXE"; it already
    does everything you want and more.

    It's an easy calculation... Here's the derivation I posted to
    the "genaral@porschefans.com" sublist a few months ago, in
    response to the query "What's a dyno?":

------- Forwarded Message Follows ------

"Dyno" is short for "dynamometer"; it's a machine that measures the
torque of an engine.

There are a couple of ways to build a dyno... Some keep the engine
running at a constant speed and put a gradually-increasing load on it;
others put a constant load on the engine and see how rapidly it can
accelerate under that load.

There are dynos that measure the torque right at the flywheel
("engine dynos") and dynos that measure the torque at the rear
wheels ("chassis dynos").  Chassis dynos are more convenient for
those of us whose engines are already in our cars, but since their
measurements are affected by losses through the drivetrain (which are
usually only estimated), their absolute accuracy is lower than that of
engine dynos.

You'll notice that I've talked about measuring TORQUE, not
horsepower... That's because dynamometers can't directly measure
horsepower; horsepower is CALCULATED from the measured torque. 

Here's how it all works:

    Torque is the product of a force and its moment arm.  That is,

        Torque = FR, where F is the force in pounds and R is the
                     length of the moment arm in feet.

    Work is, for our purposes, the product of a force and the
    magnitude of its displacement.  That is,

        Work = FS, where F is the force in pounds and S is the 
               displacement in feet.

    Power is the rate at which work is performed:

        Power = Work/Time.  We'll measure time in minutes.

As I mentioned, dynamometers only measure torque, in foot-pounds. To
calculate horsepower, we have to combine that torque measurement with
a time measurement.  Here's how:

    A long time ago, James Watt performed some experiments and
    determined that a horse could lift 550 pounds at a rate of 1 foot
    per second.  This unit of power, 550 foot-pounds per second,
    became known as the "Horsepower".

    Since I already said that we'd be dealing with time in MINUTES,
    not seconds, we can multiply by 60 seconds/minute to get:

        1 Horsepower = 33000 foot-pounds/minute,

    which implies that a horse can lift 33000 pounds a distance of one
    foot in a minute, or launch a one-pound weight to a height of
    33000 feet in the same time... No mean feat.

    But I digress.

To calculate an engine's horsepower at some given speed, you do 
the following:

    Rev the engine to the desired speed.

    Measure the torque at that speed.

    Multiply the torque by 2 * PI * the engine speed in revolutions
    per minute.  This gives you:

        X foot-pounds * 2 * PI * REVOLUTIONS
        ------------------------------------,
                     MINUTE

    where "X" is the measured torque.    

    If you look closely, you'll see that this is a FORCE (in pounds)
    times a DISTANCE ("one foot * 2 * PI * revolutions" is the
    distance the tip of our one-foot moment arm travels, in feet)
    divided by TIME (in minutes).

    From the definitions I gave earlier, FORCE times DISTANCE divided
    by TIME equals POWER, so the above equation gives us power  
    (expressed in foot-pounds per minute).

    To convert from foot-pounds per minute to horsepower (one
    horsepower = 33000 foot-pounds per minute, remember), we simply
    divide by 33000.

    So...

                 Torque * 2 * PI * RPM
    Horsepower = ---------------------
                         33000

                 Torque * RPM
               = ------------
                 33000/(2*PI)

                 Torque * RPM
               = ------------,
                     5252

    which, incidentally, implies that an engine's torque and
    horsepower curves cross at 5252 RPM.
