<<Hello everyone,

All this talk about how to avoid those speeding tickets reminds me of an

encounter I had in my 928 a couple years ago. Traveling down I-64 W. at
about

100 mph (I know, I shouldn't be breaking the law!) when I got radared from a

Ky. State Boy going E. After I passed him, I looked in the mirror, and sure

enough, he was cutting thru the median and turning around to come get me.

(lights not on yet) I could also see him becoming smaller in my mirror, so

I'm thinking, do I let off the gas and get a big ticket, or push harder on

the go-pedal and possibly escape. >>

Ditto.  Traveling down I40 outside Knoxville on the way to Asheville, N.C.,
and then home to Williamsburg.  Started out in Memphis in the morning and
wouldn't get home till 12:30 at night, so I was moving.  About 90 to 120
during the last few minutes when I see the trooper moving the other
direction. I saw him slow, and I nailed it up to 145.  Just as I get around
the next curve (and can't even see him anymore) I see a little pull off area.
 Not quite a rest area, but a wide strip of gravel with a couple of tables
and a dumpster.  I pulled in and then got out of the car and acted like I was
looking for something in the trunk.  I saw him go by with his lights on, and
then about 30 seconds later (when I was back in the car) I saw the original
trooper and an unmarked go flying by the other way.  Well, I backed out and
ran it up to the hundreds again, and never had any trouble.  It was like the
turnout was made for me.  Thank god.

P.S.  I left for Baltimore on Friday morning in pooring rain. I mean you
could barely even see the cars in front of you.  It was slow going, or so I
thought, all the way there.  I made it in exactly 3:30.  That was the best
time anybody had told me I could make it from Williamsburg to Baltimore,
depending entirely on the D.C. area traffic.  The only unusual event was when
a brand new Isuzu Trooper traveling about 100 feet in front of me spun 1 and
1/2 times and ended up facing down the road.  This was when all the  traffic
was moving about 80.  Luckily there were four lanes at this point and the
traffic wasn't bunched up.  

On the way back I made the same distance in 2:52.  This was at an average of
78 for the entire trip, including the stop and go city traffic at the
beggining and end of the trip. And it also included many miles through the
second most congested metropolitan area in the country (LA is first).  And
with 19.1 miles to the gallon, I had a great ride back.  In fact I was having
so much fun I never even pit stopped.  I had one run in baltimore on I 83
north (toward PA from I 695) up to 155.  And on the way back I had a couple
of runs to the 140's.  I am sure it will be a while before I break the 155
mark.  Oh well, something to look forward to.
