sorry but the aerodynamic HP calculator is wrong. I gave the numbers for the
959, , 951,944s,and 968turbo and all were false. For the 944 were ~right but
it seems the program calculate more hp than the car realy needs. +50 for the
959, +40 for the 968 turbo etc. One important thing miss on this program. The
gear ratio. the 993 with 320 hp has 181 mph top and the 993TT also 181 mph but
with 400+ HP.
But the accelaretion is totally different.
