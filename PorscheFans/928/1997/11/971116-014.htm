Dear Steve ('87S4/auto/white) and fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

Steve, your reply was partially correct. However, I want to correct a
possible 
misunderstanding. The brake regulator in no way reduces the amount of force 
transmitted to the front brakes. It only alows more pressure to the rears. 
Since 1986, all 928's have ABS, so the inclusion of an 18 Bar regulator may
have 
been overkill. By changing the regulator from an 18 Bar to a 33 or 55 Bar
the 
amount of braking done by the rear brakes increases. As the front brakes are
 
assisted to a greater extent, they do not wear down quite as fast given the
same 
braking conditions and use. One benefit from this is the front pads need
only be 
replaced twice as often as the rears instead of three times as often. As you
 
pointed out, under braking the weight shifts forward. Consequently, the
fronts 
will always wear faster due to the fact that they do more than 50% of the
braking.

One more thing, although the braking improvement will be noticed at an
autocross, 
it has greater benefit while on the track. Since the rears are contributing
more 
to the overall braking effort, the amount of time spent braking will be
reduced 
and the front pads will run slightly cooler than before.

Happy motoring. Ed
