Oh boy, today was one of the worst days I've had in a while.

Bad 928 related thing number 1:

I'm walking to my car from my work and I see I pickup truck sliding on the
wet pavement and SLAM into my parked yellow beauty. It took out the rear
bumper, BOTH quarter panels, bent the hatch big time (and shattered the
glass), and the force spun my car around!  I turns out it was a 17 year old
girl driving, and she wasn't even on her dad's insurance plan! So now the
$12-15k damage will be paid by them out of pocket!

Bad 928 related thing number 2:

I was driving home, pissed off, and generally in a bad mood (see above for
reason) and was going about 75 in a 50, BUT, I had the car in low gear, I
think third, and the car was really PURRING @4.5k RPM (you know, loud!!,
see fluidesign.com/928 for reason why). I get off the exit and I notice a
cop behind me, when I was at the light on a side street. He took the normal
30 or so seconds to run my plate and then pulled me over. He immediately
told me and my passenger to steop out of the car, threw me on my hood, (and
scratching my paint!!), and searched me and my passenger (a female). He
said we were estimated at 100 mph. He didn't have his radar on, and was at
a stop light at an intersection with the road I was travelling on when he
saw us going by.

 Now, the high volume of the exhaust, and the condition of my rear bumper
(destroyed) led him to pull us over. He then wanted to search the car
(meanwhile, 4!! other cruisers pulled up, Wellesley Cops figure, all a
bunch of punk motherfuckers who have nothing better to do than harass
people who work hard to own and drive nice cars), I said no he can't, you
have no right to, and you have no probable cause. He said, "ok smart-ass,
how about I tow this thing, throw you in jail, and impound the car and tear
the interior apart." I couldn't believe this guy's attitude. I then let up
and said ok, search the car, they looked through the whole car, and brought
filthy drug sniffing dogs in on my new leather to search. Eventually they
let me go and gave me a $450 citation.

I am sick and tired of being harrassed day in and day out by police
officers. A citizen should have a right to operate his cars on public
roadways without being constantly stopped and harassed, physically roughed
up, and have his property seized and searched.

I work hard to keep up that car, and I'm not a pimp, or a drug dealer, or
any other kind of criminal, though I am repeatedly treated like one.

I am getting rid of the 928, a car I love dearly, and one which I've
invested much time and money into. I hope I can afford to send it to Greece
to keep as my car there, but I may be forced to sell it if my finances
can't deal. I went to a Porsche dealership (I won't be driven away from my
favorite marque) and picked out a nice Silver/Black Boxster, with a STOCK
exhaust, that sounds nice yet is quite.

I am very sad that my days of 340+ HP acceleration, rail-like cornering,
and eye-popping braking are over, not to mention the Formula 1 sound, but
the Boxster is a nice little car, and the Silver/black configuration is
subtle, and classy. Not my style, but what can I do. I'm only going to be
in this country a few more years, so I'll make do......

This was a very bad day indeed,

(now, for the Boxster, 18" 3 piece supercup wheels {Mr. Wood, you getting
this?}, lowering springs, nice stereo, and I'm ready to roll)
