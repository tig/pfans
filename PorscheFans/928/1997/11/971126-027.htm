P-fans,

My understanding of tuck-in is the way the car turns in more sharply
with trailing throttle because of increased weight on the front tires.

This is exactly what I was doing two weekends ago out at the race track in
the slow corners.  The car does understeer pretty badly but in a slow corner
you can trail the brake and get the nose to turn in (or the back to come
around) nicely.  It makes the whole driving experience very enjoyable.  These
are great track cars (probably like a higher powered and slightly over weight
944/968) that will save you when you screw up or just let you have lots of
fun pushing your envelope but not getting close to the cars.
