Well Everyone it looks like we are going to have 10 to 15 cars at the
Frenzy!  Ali, the owner of German Precision Motors, and I are trying to put
together a cookout lunch for all 928 owners.....So a RSVP is really
important if you want to eat!  Due to the fact that I have recieved a ton of
email concerning the event, it looks like we may have some spectators.  I
have tried to keep this low profile for 928 owners and their friends.  The
lunch is not intended for the general public.  I'm paying for the food out
of pocket! If any of the 928 owners are bringing more that one passenger, I
need to know so I can have the right amount of food on hand!  remember we
have to unite to get all 928 owners excited about their cars!  See you all
on Dec 6th!
