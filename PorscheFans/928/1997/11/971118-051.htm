Ok pfans - if you've a lead on a quality 928 S4 or better in the NY area
(or beyond) let Robert know (read his post below!)

FWIW I've seen many ads for PAR in Hemmings Monthly Auto News (see your
local super bookstore) and they seem to have a decent selection.  You
might be getting a call from Brian Buxton as he is fast becoming the
nationwide 928 locating expert (a shameless plug here).  

There a alot of internet based sites that could help in your search too,
start with the links on my website too.

Good luck in your 928 hunt!
Phil Tong
