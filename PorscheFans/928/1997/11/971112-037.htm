	My definition of danger is travelling on the same road as you at the
same time in either direction. Other drivers have the right to expect
reward for defensive driving, but how would one defend against you?  The
closure rates at the speeds you're talking about puts us in the class
with deer.  "Of course, I don't want to hit one" I think you said. Do
the track.  You'll like it!

It's a good thing, then, that I don't live in Portland anymore.  I'll be sure
and let you know when I am in Oregon, and give you an itinerary.  I hope that
wasn't you the other day when I was in town. I was driving a white Sedan De
Ville (with the 32 valve, V8, Northstar-- quite an engine, but top speed
limited to 113 MPH, which is a good thing because at that speed it is about
like driving a matress) , ring any bells?

Get serious.  I have done the track, and I do like it, and so what?

Would you, please, re-read everything I posted and see if there was a
situation when I was traveling through traffic above, say, 80 or so?  You
have NO idea just what the hell you are talking about.  I'm done with this
topic.  If you, or anybody else, has anything else to say, then take it off
the list and to me directly.
