Hello all,

Michael....you write

My car is an 87'  5spd. with LSD.
A couple weeks ago I changed from Swepco to Mobil 1 Synthetic Gear Lube.
The Mobil 1 was available locally, whereas, the Redline would've had to been
ordered. Cost was about $1 cheaper per quart for the Mobil 1. I can tell the
Mobil 1 is definitely slicker shifting when cold. (I think the Swepco is good
stuff too, but a little too "industrial", leaning towards protection of gears
in high load conditions rather than shiftability when cold.)
As usual, I researched before I made a decision, and although the Redline
looks to be great stuff, I went with the Mobil 1 because it was readily
available when I was ready to change it, and it too comes highly recommended.
(also--when I re-pack wheel bearings next year, my car will be totally Mobil
1 lubricants) (one less thing to remember!)
Now I'm not saying one is better than another -- in fact the Redline may spec
out to be a better product than the Mobil 1, but thru my research, I had
decided on the Redline 75w-90 Gear Oil (if I'd have went with it), because
from what I saw on their webpage, the NS does not have friction modifiers for
LSD applications.   
See webpage excerpt below...

LIMITED-SLIP COMPATIBILITY

Red Line Gear Oils, with the exception of the 75W90NS, already contain
friction modifier required for operation in limited-slip differentials.
Additional additive is not required. 

PRODUCT APPLICATION

75W90 Gear Oil - the preferred product in nearly all car and light truck
differentials, both conventional and limited-slip. 75W90 is preferred for
most racing applications. It contains friction modifier which is recommended
for limited-slip units. 75W90 Gear Oil can be used in many transmissions and
transaxles; however, other Red Line lubricants have better frictional
properties for rapid synchronization. Exceeds API GL-5. 

75W90 NS - a GL-5 which does not contain the friction modifiers for
limited-slip hypoid differentials. This makes the transmission synchronizers
come to equal speeds more quickly, allowing faster shifting and much easier
low-temperature shifting. Can also be used in racing limited-slip
differentials where weak spring design causes too much wheel spin.

'''''''''''
Now, from my understanding, it seems that I can have friction modifiers
required for LSD, or not have the friction modifiers, and have slicker
shifting, but not both.
Since my car only gets on a track about 10-15 times per year, Id've went with
their recommendation (or at least my perception of what I read) of the
75w-90.  
Can you shed a little more light on the subject and your recommendation of
the NS? Are you sure it means "Non Slippery"?

You also write....
>BTW, Roy Howell, Red Line's chief chemist recommends the 75W90NS in the
>928.

Michael, I do not doubt that Roy and yourself know more about the subject
than I, but the website seems to contradict this somewhat. 
(I swear, I'm not trying to be a prick or beat the proverbial dead horse!)
Please don't be mad at me, I'm just the curious type.  :)   

Ok, enough on that subject,
Phil T....you write
>Thanks for the compliment - now if I could only do something about my
>actual driving!

You are welcome...without your work, we wouldn't be where we are today with
this 928 thing. We can't all be Jacques Villeneuve's, (myself included) but
at least we have better cars to practice in than 99.9% of the population! 
(speaking of driving....how about Schumacher turning in on Villeneuve and
blowing the championship? ....sorry Shumacher fans....I like him also, but it
wasn't a very smart move from one who is arguably the greatest driver today
......especially amplified by the fact that Jacques let Hakkinen and Coulthard
by on the last lap, instead of pushing the issue, being childish about it,
and blowing the championship.)  

Sorry for the long post.

Regards to all,
Greg Schickel
