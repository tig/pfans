<<When I called the dealer about it, they told me that it is drivable, but
the transmission is slipping.  Otherwise, it is supposed to run good and is
in good shape.  What I'm wondering is Should I buy this car?  I desperately
want a 928 and I can afford this one, but I can't go over about $1000 worth
of repairs until late January/Early February.>>

Keep two things in mind (in addition to all the things people are going to
tell you about buying a car that you can't afford, and the maintenance issues
on the 928's that are low priced)  1) It may be the one for you  2)
January/February is only two months away.  

I think the without any other information I could go either way.  Go look at
the car and talk to an experienced local mechanic.  My pick:  Alan Blanchard,
at A&P Specialties off 82nd.  I sent somebody else to him, have heard a good
initial report, but nothing else from that person on how the visit ended.
 But, I spent many happy hours dropping off/picking up at Alan's.  I wasn't
the only 928 there, and the guy knows what he is doing.  He also is thorough
and reasonable.  Phone number is 254-7310.

 

<<Does anybody know the average cost for auto transmission repairs/rebuild

or the cost of the parts so I can do it myself?  Or, is this a semi common

problem with a relatively cheap fix (low transmission fluid I hope)?  The

dealer sells a lot of Porsches, so I imagine they have correctly identified

the problem areas.>>

Could be low fluid.  Go look at/drive the car.  Report back with more
specific information.  Keep in mind that the 928 in Portland, especially the
older models, is not rare.  You may want to wait.  But you need much more
information to make an informed decision.  

Good luck,
