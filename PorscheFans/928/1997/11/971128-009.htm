As much as I despise insurance premiums like everyone else, it's hard for me
to get as excited about it as others who have recently posted to the list
concerning the high costs and poor return.

My 87S4 runs me about $900/year for complete coverage, with a rather steep
deductible ($500) and $100K/300K liability.  But I've got 4 vehicles insured
with Allstate.  They've always treated me fairly (I've been dealing with the
same Allstate agent for more than 20 years), and have never raised my rates
for either moving violations or accidents (have had my share of both).
 Getting repair settlements has always been painless and my repairs have been
more than satisfactory (my autobody shop of choice coincidently is one of
their authorized shops)...just drop off the car, pick it up when its done.

Admittedly, I haven't had to deal with a "total", which can certainly be
problematical.  The only thing I can say with respect to collision damage; if
you think your vehicle is worth considerably in excess of book value, you'd
better seriously consider stated value policies provided by specialty vehicle
insurance companies (look in Hemmings).  Collectible cars really have no
business being insured by conventional insurance policies if you think you
are going to get what they're worth.  Usually people (including myself)
insure using standard policies because they are less expensive for the very
reason that the book value understates the value which you perceive the car
to be worth.  So we are doing it to ourselves....when we try to collect we
get burned, but it's our own fault.

I recently sold a collectible motorcycle (79 Suzuki GS1000S) for $3500, but
the insurance carrier I was using (Progressive) had the value at around
$1200.  Sure the insurance was dirt cheap ($85/year), but I was getting the
protection I paid for.  I was betting that any accident I had would be less
than the total value, but that's a big gamble.  I would have been much wiser
to insure it for stated value (at a higher premium).

As older 928s become less mainstream cars, conventional insurance (collision)
becomes less and less sensible due to the low book value versus perceived
collectible value.

If Paul manages to get his $17K for his Euro 86, I'll be more than a little
amazed (and he'll deserve the kudos he gets).
