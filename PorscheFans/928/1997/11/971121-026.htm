Rob Gold (Rgvivace@aol.com) inquired of Andy McIntyre (andyjmc@ihug.co.nz):
Is the steel in a 928's body hot-dip galvanized before or after forming into
body panels?
 
(AM)  Don't know.  Interesting question.
 
(RG) What forces can cause failure modes in the zinc coating?
 
(AM) or bare metal sanding, it would depend wich metal you bared.  Obviously
once all the paint is off, any further, and you're into the Zinc.  I'm not
sure how the first layer of paint is applied, and whether there's any
chemical reaction between the paint and the zinc.  If so it would be
difficult to get off all the paint, and none of the zinc.

(RG) could steam cleaning -- especially after a winter on salty roads (or
peanuts)  -- dmage the zinc coating?

(AM) I should be most surprised if steam cleaning caused any problems.
 Especially since Porsche themselves recommend a thorough steam cleaning
after the winter season, followed by a rigorous inspection of the underseal
for any deterioation.  Maintenance of the underseal is most important in
ensuring the longevity of the vehicle.  The special lightweight editions with
no underseal did not carry the long-life guarantee.

(RG) are there galvanic reactions between zinc and steel, zinc and aluminium?
(AM) Where the blazes are my chemistry books?

(AM, on the subject of salty peanuts)  Buy a dog.  Pooch will gobble any
fallen peanuts before they can damage your car.  What you do about the
dog-hair is up to you.  If you have a girlfriend, pooch's breath may well
prepare her for your own, folowing the beer which caused you to spill the
peanuts in the first place.

"An informed democracy will not spill peanuts."

(RG) Andy, if your initial democracy quote was Thomas Jefferson, does that
mean this variation is from Samuel Adams.  (Hint to Kiwi's: Samuel Adams =
old Boston brewery.)

(RG) Since my late '86 is an indiskret Indischrot, does this mean I should or
should not use red skin peanuts?
