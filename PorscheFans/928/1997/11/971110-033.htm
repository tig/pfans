You're spending too much time thinking about it. And worrying.

Let me plant some more bugs in your ear to think about:

- Far more people post to this list when they have a problem than when 
  they don't have problems.

- With a 928 you have connected with a large body of owners/drivers who
  love their car(s) and will find one way or another to keep them 
  running for decades. While an NSX is a very good car, Acura doesn't
  have the heart or soul that Porsche has. One could argue if that 
  heart and soul originates with Porsche or Porsche-owners. I think
  it takes both.

- When I rebuilt my '83 928S's 5-speed I enlisted the help of one of the
  local ace amateur Corvette guys, a friend and co-worker. Going over 
  the parts list and prices I paid, he commented, "about the same as
  Chevy parts" with one exception, the $560 main pinion bearing
  assembly.

- After listing 3 "uppers", lets not forget that a 1987 car is still
  10 years old and is bound to experience some unscheduled maintenence.
