What's up with US television in New Zealand?  You guys only get "Dukes of
Hazzard" and "Starsky and Hutch" re-runs, or what?  To the best of my
knowledge (please don't add to this thread by correcting me) the party ain't
over if you cross a state line. . .only the jail changes.

[in New Zealand]. . . ."No seperate highway patrol or state troopers, and no
making it over the state border to safety."
>snip<

And two more sarcastic tongue-in-cheek quips:
1) You'd think it was fishing season with all the tall tales being told this
month - who started this?  They are fun to read, though. . .and we all have
one pre-Porsche story or another.


2) To our resident urban-traffic race drivers  --  The more traffic fines
you pay, the less my taxes go up - do the math - just don't hurt anybody.
(said by someone who has contributed to any number of state coffers in his
youth)
