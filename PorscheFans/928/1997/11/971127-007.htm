When I bought my 84 928, I could not even open the hatch with the key -
I thought the tumbler had broken.  But sometime later, the electric
release failed.  I pulled the release next to the seat, the motor
spun for a short run, then stopped.  I decided to strip-off, clean, re-
lube all latch components (wow, even the key works now).  The electric
latch release is a small DC motor with 4 plastic reduction gears.  The
final drive gear has a metal foil disk where 2 brush-like contacts
connecting the motor circuit enable the unit to sense where the end of 
the "cycle" is - one of the contact eventually hits a small spot on the
disk where there is no foil, and the circuit is broken, and rotation
stops.  When you pull the release next to the seat, it will send current
to the motor for a short duration of time, until the brush touches foil,
and rotates again until the circuit is broken by the non-conductive spot
on the foil disk.

Now the problem.  Opened the hatch, and it sounded strange but the hatch
opened as usual.  I pulled the release again to listen to the sound
again and this time it ran and ran and ran until I pulled the plug on 
the motor.  I determined after 3 hours on it, that there is no
mechanical reason for it doing this.  It seems that momentum of the now
very clean and lubricated gears don't let the motor stop in time before
the brush passes by the non-conductive area of the foil disk, and it 
continues to rotate.  I even widened the no-foil area to no avail.  I
eventually widened it to the point where it worked (cutting some foil
with an exacto knife) but when I closed my driver-side door, it engaged
again and the latch opened without anything more than the apparent
vibration of the door closing.  I don't like the idea of the hatch
opening on its own, so I have left it disconnected for now.

Any Ideas?  There is a transistor, resistor and diode soldered to the 
little motor half of the unit.  What do these components do?  Are they
some sort of DC motor brake?  There are 3 electrical connections to the
unit - (I assume) a hot, a ground, and a switched hot. Simple, right?

Der evil Dr. Porsche hund his hatchen spitzen sparken motor - Arrrrrgh!

On this day, I give thanks for my many blessings, including that this is
the only outstanding problem on my daily driver at this time (knock O W)
