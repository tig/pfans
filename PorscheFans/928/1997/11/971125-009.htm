Oh boy, I got a call today from an insurance adjuster informing me my car
was totalled. A drunk girl kissed (well, a forceful kiss, french) the rear
of my 85' and the damage is about $10k, though the insurance likes $7.4k.
Anyway, they feel it is a total loss and would like to offer me, hold on
tight... $6,000 for my pristine Euro yellow beauty
(www.fluidesign.com/928). They claim that the car only has 50% of the value
of US car counterparts. Anyway, I called the appraiser and told him I won't
accept anything less than $10k to fix the car, or less than $17,000 for the
value of the car, and to call me when he gets his head on straight.

$6,000, what are we talking about, an 85' Honda?
