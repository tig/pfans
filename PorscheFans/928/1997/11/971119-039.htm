We've been corresponding off the list about this. Have you actually 
attempted to disassemble your HVAC control yet?

I replaced the bulb in my HVAC control (1983). Never thought to ask for 
instructions before attacking it. That was about 5 years ago. Might 
have pictures of the thing. Will look.

Not only that an idiot PO or idiot mechanic had been in there before 
me and *lost* the fiber optics. Spent an evening fabricating new. Think 
I still have one laying around as a made several and used what I 
thought was the best. Know I still have some of the fiber. Was rather 
proud of my success as I have never seen the genuine Porsche fiber 
optics.

Had to fabricate new because Porsche would sell new sliding knobs and 
spring clips but as Donald has found out, doesn't list any other parts 
inside the HVAC controls.
