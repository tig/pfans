Hey everyone,
	Back from our capital city, and it looks like I get to make the first post.
We had 7 cars (4 white, 1 ea. bronze, silver & maroon).  First photo shoot saw our
gallant shutter-bugs precariously perched atop a wobbly fence at our friendly
repair-shop.  The things we do ...  The next stop was aborted because the 
later-model cars (with low fronts) couldn't make it onto the pretty patch of grass
with the lovely harbour view.  So off to the wharves in convoy.  Something of a
circus - our town's Christmas parade had just finished, so there was heaps of trafic,
and people everywhere.  And they charged us $3 each for parking!  Some people have no
taste.  Pleasant wee meal at a local seafood restaurant and then off on our separate
ways.
	Some thoughts.  
i	Check that your ideal spot for a photo-shoot is friendly to chin-spoilers
ii	Have an itinnery -- 2 of us went on an impromptu Sunday drive after a
	misunderstanding
iii	Name tags.  Look silly, but help failing memories.

	No doubt there'll be further posts on this. In closing; what a lovely bunch
of folk 928'ers are.
	Thanks to Andy & John for organization, and to Tom for the excuse.
