I know we all feel a sense of camaraderie here on the list and this is a
good thing - we are afterall 928 fans!  

But this doesn't always translate when dealing with business
transactions - I got burned buying a xeroxed update manual instead of
the genuine thing like I thought I was paying for.  And BTW just how
many of us fell for that?  Specifically the GT updates manual advertised
awhile back...

Anyways, you all know I call 'em as I see 'em, witness my post on D&D
Trucking or should I say wrecking.  Maybe the D&D stands for Dumb and
Dumber but then I feel the dumbest for using them.  ahem.  

This is a small community we have and news, both good and bad, travels
fast.  Lucky and I were talking how foolish it would be for anyone to
steal a 928 nowadays and try to part it.  Hell, the VIN's and numbers
would be posted worldwide in seconds and woe to whoever's left holding
the bag.

Marc R. I hope the issue gets resolved to your satisfaction...
Phil Tong
