<<Now, lets talk about good news.....I'm happy for you, in that you seem
to
have found a an 89' GT worthy of putting in your stable. (It must be
nice,
otherwise, I'm sure it wouldn't be considered as a replacement for your
current 928) Sorry about about the radiator woes. Does it really run
noticeably better than the 87'? Differences that you like better or
worse
than the S4? (I know the differences between them, I'd just like to hear
a
comparison from your knowledgeable self.)>>

Greg,
Well, I've sort of changed my mind, yet again.  I have talked to a
couple of people about selling my 87 S4 and now am thinking that I am
going to keep it.  It's just in too nice of shape and I have put too
much of myself into it.  So ... I called my customer on the GT and told
him he could have it.  Oh well.  As far as the S4 being faster/slower
than the GT, I'm not sure.  I drove the car very easy on the way home,
but I'd say that the torque is much more useable with the 5-spd.  And
the GT does have the cool digital readout on the dash along with the
appearance enhancing radio antennae on the roof.  But no way will it
give the 930 a run for it's money.  You'll just have to ride in my car
to understand - we'll meet up in the next couple of weeks if you want
to.  Well, off to work again.  Talk to you all later.
Brian Buxton

P.S.  Rob Galassos gave me a call and I will be locating him a 928 based
on morethan a few recommendations from you listers!  Thanks!
