Just a brief note and a question to all.

I had my 928 for two days and the knobs for the radio, a/c (front and
back) fell off in my hand. I looked at them and found that the little
springy metal clips were gone. I thought about glueing them on, but
thought better of it quickly. I was at work a few days later and
stumbled over a strip of steel banding, so I picked it up and threw it
away. Then it hit me, that's spring steel, and would make a great knob
clip. I salvaged a small piece, used a small pair of metal snips to cut
it to size and slipped it on. The whole thing worked better than the
original I suspect. At least now it takes a major pull to get the knobs
off, and it'll be a very cold day when it comes off in my hand. For what
it's worth.

Question?
In the center console, are the window, sun roof, and rear wiper switches
backlit? If they are suposed to be, they aren't in mine. I hope I only
have a fuse out, becuse it's tough on a new owner finding those switches
at night. Surely such a minor detail would not have been overlooked
given I can't have a tire pressure delta of 2 psi or more without
lighting up the world on the dash.

Oh yeah, Dallas area 928'rs, pencil in Dec. 6 for show and tell.

Any help appreciated.
