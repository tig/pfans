this my educated opinion on the braking thing ( aircraft tech, 6yrs auto
brake mech)
1 Brakers are larger on the fronts of vehicles because under normal
conditions the                   front wheels have more traction due to
weight transfer.

2 my 76 lincoln had anti lock on the rear wheels because of this weight
transfer.

3.  if your E brake is working properly and well adjusted both wheels will
brake    
equally.

4.  There are only a few styles of e brakes that are strong enough to lock
rear wheels

5 if  rear wheels lock car will track straight unless driver does something
stupid.

try this netime you drive on ice.  in a front wheel drive car, drive at
steady speed, and quickly take your foot off of gas, result is usually a
spin.  In a rear wheel drive, do the same, car will track straight.  
The engine acts as a brake when you quickly take your foot off gas.  the
drive wheels become a pivot (maybe the concept of a weather vane may clear
this up?)

If you know what you are doing, and know what you are driving, using the e
brake is not a problem.
