<<Hi guys,
I saw a post from Brian in the archives(can't seem to get back on the non
digest mode) about all of you guys gathering in Asheville on December 6th.
 What's up?>>

As we are dealing with a construction project, delays may occur.  As it
stands now, my oldest friend is opening his bar on December 6.  I am for
obvious reasons attending.  David Roberts is doing the multimedia install,
and also for obvious reasons attending.  John Ryall is coming along for the
good time, and may be driving his 928 as well depending on how many people
come with John and I.  If its just us, then we will take one car or the
other.

I will post more info as the date firms up.  If anyone has interest in
knowing the details, email me directly and I will start a distribution list
so the details get out to the interested parties.
