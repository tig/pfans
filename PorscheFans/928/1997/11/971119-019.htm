Again, no 928 content, but for those who have found this subject amusing,
or at least worth reading.

That is good policy, but occasionally, even I slip and zoom a little when I
know its not quite as safe as possible, but I'm the only car on the road.

I think this goes anytime when doing 90+ on any road.  There are people
killed around here quite frequently with the officer giving the information
that the "driver lost control of the sports car".  How?  You'd have to be
in really deep to do that if you were paying attention, but if not, then
they often don't get a second chance.

Wild cow story, too.  Guess having those super wide tires make finding the
cow legs and lining them up for the jump easier ;)
