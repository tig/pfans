"I can't help but think that a major reason (not the
only reason) for the car's disappearance from the market was due to a
lot of
uncorrected problems that plagued the car up until its termination.  I
have
talked to many 911 owners who said that they had heard from "former" 928

owners that the cars were maintenance nightmares (i.e., frequent and
costly)"

This reminds me of shopping for a Lincoln LSC back in
about.....um......'92.......Chicago (biggest LSC market I know of).
Anyhow, I was checking on one (LSC) at a dealer in the western 'burbs
and spotted a gorgeous red 79 next to an LSC.   Even then, my latent
Porsche attraction was just below the surface......so I asked the
salesperson what price on the 928?   He said $11,000 - and the brains
fell out of my forehead!    He couldn't help but notice the lust and awe
in my eyes - and the five year old daughter clutching at my hand.   He
took it upon himself to then advise, "You know, if the tranny is out of
one of those, you'll be in for another two grand......the maintenance is
a killer!"

Looking back, I wonder why a used car salesperson in metro Chicago would
say such a discouraging thing?  I expect he had it already in mind for
someone else, or he was driving it as his 'loaner' from the
dealership........whatever.   But, he certainly planted the seeds of
fear of ownership of the 928.   Obviously, it didn't matter in the end -
and I'm in here as another brain-dead-for-928 fanatic.

John,

"Tuck-In" is the equivalent term for oversteer.  That is, if your rear end
oversteers (i.e., goes out), then conversely you front end tucks in.  No more
complicated than that.  Some people like to refer to the front end when
discussing cornering effect; understeer refers to front end behavior and so
does tuck in, while oversteer really refers to what's going on at the back.
They're both "effect", not "cause".

I've seen this term used all over the place to describe cornering behavior.
