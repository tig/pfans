DEar Sharkers with kids:

Soemtime ago, about the dawn of time, my wife and  I looked for a solution
to transporting our young children in our 912.  What we found could work in
the little seats in back, was a safety harness that came (I think) from
Sears, that secured the entire torso of the child, and was secured to the
car using the lapbelt assembly.  I really wasn't too thrilled with the
concept of child safety seats, and especially those available in the late
60's/early 70's.  So we used this harness type deal, and if I had it to do
over, I think that I would try to have a harness made specifically for each
child, rather than try to jury rig something to fit the small seats in these
cars.

When my children were young, we would have had a difficult time paying $150
or more (or it equivilent) for a child seat.  The harness was a webbed torso
panel that fastened around the child at the hips and under the arms (I
think), onto a broad strap.  There was also a strap that ran under the
child, between the legs and joined the rear panel somehow....the lap belt
then ran through the rear panel, and althought he child had some movement,
the who thing was quite secure and there was no way that the child could hit
the front seat back under any circumstance. 

I am sure that if Porsche actually makes a restraint for children now, then
it will be the usual overengineered device and it might even work.  

Anyway, glad that I don't have to worry about it now....child seats that is,
or wife, either, for that matter.
