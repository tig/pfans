More seriously, though, we're pretty lucky here as it is, Andy.  Our cops are human
(mostly), they don't carry guns, and speed cameras have meant the introduction of
safe speeding for anyone who can afford it - that is - you don't get demerit points,
you just pay the money and enjoy the car.  

I mean, look at it this way:  They've picked out challenging little stretches of road
and put those little black signs on them to let you know that the challenge is there.
They simply invoice you by mail if you decide to make use of these curvey, exciting
stretches of tarmac and, if you ask nicely, they will even send you a photo which
proves to all your friends just what speed you were able to attain in your fine automobile
through that section of road.

What a neat system!

Seems to me like you need to pick somewhere else to live within the USA
that doesn't have a bunch of arseholes pretending to "serve and protect".

Now, on a similar vein, if I was to magically obtain a visa to allow myself
to work in the USA, and I wanted to live in a place where the weather was
fairly warm (rules out Montana) and I could drive a 928GT around without
fear of police harassment (rules out wherever Paul lives), and T1 Internet
connections were cheap, where would that place be?

BTW, although I'm not a drug pusher or a pimp, I do have rather long hair,
and could easily be mistaken for a rock musician. Would this need to be
taken into account in choosing a location? I assume Alabama is out?

For sale: Spare apostrophes. Plenty to go around, mostly black sports
models with better latteral support. And, oh, they've been waxed as well.
