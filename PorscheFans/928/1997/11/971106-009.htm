Recently I decided to finally tear into my instrument pod due to several
quirky electrical problems which would be fixed temporarily by raising the
pod and lowering it again.  These problems ranged from flickering headlights
to that annoying little indicator that tells you you don't have brake lamps.
I saved this until I had a complete Saturday available. (Few and far
between)  Anyway it was not as daunting as it first appeared.  there really
is not much more electronics involved that any other dash I have removed.
If you take it slow and careful, removal of the pod without removing the
steering is actually quite easy, just time consuming.  While I had it apart,
I replaced all bulbs since it was such a pain to get to. They cost about $26
(30 bulbs). My reasoning was  it is better to have new bulbs than 7 year old
bulbs that might go out soon.  Ayway there were 4 main connectors to the
instrument panel which should never come loose by design, however I think
the individual connections themselves are fault prone.  Using a small emory
board, I cleaned all the contacts and reinstalled.  No problems since. Oh,
BTW my dash lights are brighter than they were in the past.
