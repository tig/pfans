Well I finally found my problem.  After pulling the din plug apart at the
amp I found two terminals touching.  Fixed that, wired in my crossover,
alphasonic amp, CD changer, radar dectector and radar jammer.  Now I'm
ready for battle.  I found the back of the rear seats to be a sitable place
to attatch the amp and CD changer.  The black luggage cover hides most of
it.  I too am also pulling apart my HVAC conroller to fix the bulb.  It is
pretty straight forward and the bulb looks like a smaller version of an
early mustang instrument panel bulb, if any of you blokes know what that
looks like.  While I was on my fix trip I also fixed the seat (no it
doesn't have better lateral support,and they are red), replaced the heater
control valve, and threw in a K&N air filter.  I also found a ground
problem on my ABS sensor which was tripping my light.  Needlless to say I
have put a few hours in on my little shark.  Being that this is the first
Porsche that I have worked on, it is amazing how many "hidden" screws there
are. I am know replacing the tiny bulbs in the foglamp and odometer
switches.  Do these things just pll out?  Anyway Thats been my week, I look
forward to kicking some Camaro butt!!!
   
   PT  - Good initials, seen them somewhere around here!!
