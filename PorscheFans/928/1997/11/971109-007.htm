Absolutely horrible; you have my sympathy. Meanwhile, what happened with
the case in which you were looking at losing your license? That really
looked like hire-a-lawyer time to me.

And now you know, aesthetics aside, why my car is black and my exhaust
substantially stock.

Why don't you forget the Boxster and get a nice black S4? You'll get all
but the last of the above, and you may now not want the rest of the world

big time withdrawal symptoms otherwise.
