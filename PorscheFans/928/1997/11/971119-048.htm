Hey, this is a subject near and dear to my heart as it was one of my
first help messages too once I finally found a 928 to call my own way
back when (Thx again to LL & JW I believe)!

The bulb is available fairly cheaply from Automotion (under a buck as I
recall).  And yes it is serviceable.  Not easy the first go 'round but
with practice you can have the console apart in less than 5 minutes.

Doing this from memory so hope I get it in right order:
1. Pull the center vents out. Some say not really necessary but it helps
to clear the area.

2.  Surrounding the climate control is a plastic H-shaped piece.  Pry
this off protecting your leather by using a putty knife or such wrapped
in a cloth.

3.  The mounting screws for the modules should be visible now, unscrew
and remove taking care to observe how the harnesses hook up in the back.

4.  At the workbench, open up the climate control module, again taking
care to observe how the fan switch is actually comprised of little
gears, as well as grooving on the fiber optics to the slide switches.

5.  Change the bulb (obviously why we're here!)

6.  Double check the little gears line up so the fan switch numbers line
up properly.

7.  Home free.  Reassemble, reattach, etc.  you are done.  Wait for
nightfall.  Groove on new lighting!

ps.  hey welcome back Stephane and now that you're delurked a whole
bunch of new procedures went flying by to be added to your FAQ!  I had
