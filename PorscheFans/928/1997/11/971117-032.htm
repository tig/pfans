Even made the national TV news. Unfortunately I missed seeing the crash,
but by all accounts it was _very_ spectacular. Owen is a very lucky man to
have survived. I know the doctor who attended and have even more respect
for him than I used to, if that is possible!

I think you should enter. I'm sure you'll break 160km/h easily in that
distance. Make sure you have a videocamera in the car (running!) or we may
never speak to you again.
