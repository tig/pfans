I've had a few people asking about the speed runs that Auckland Car Club are doing
next weekend and the speed I expected to do.

All the indications showed that my SE would hit about 158 mph at the end of the 2 km
run-up and be doing about 166 at the end of the flying km.  This would mean just over 160
mph as a timed speed, which would make the run worth doing.

However!...  Yesterday I phoned Ray Williams, who is the guy who started the ball rolling
a few years ago with land-speed attempts here.  He still holds the NZ land-speed record
for street legal cars at 196 mph in his 1981 Porsche 930 Turbo.  (Owen Evans' 911 was
not street legal and was running for outright land-speed when he crashed at over 220 mph.)
I asked Ray about the road that the run was being done on and it turns out that he abandoned
his record attempt on this road (Canal Road West) and did it somewhere else.  The
undulations in the road were launching his 930 and at 170mph he was having so much
trouble keeping it on the road that he gave it away.

He said "I don't want to talk you out of it, but..." and suggested that anything over 150 mph
down there is pretty bad news.  There is a lot of concern around that Auckland Car Club
haven't thought through that someone WILL achieve these speeds and have a nasty off.

I'm not going to run.  I'll wait until the opportunity comes up on a safer bit of road.  Damn.
(Something about responsibility.)
