RE:     Heeeelllllppp!!!

I have a request from all the electrical geniuses on the list.  My 88s4
will not start.  It will crank but it will not start. I previously had an=

aftermartket Clifford system in it that had a remote start feature on the=

alarm module.  If you pressed the button,  the engine would crank but it
would not run.  The alarm started to give me intermittent problems so I h=
ad
a guy look at it but when we pressed the remote start feature,  the car
cranked but would never start again.  The alarm has been stripped out and=

the car is back to stock. When I crank the engine,  the fuel pump wont wo=
rk
and I get no spark.  Both computers have been checked out and are fine. =

The fuel pump relay was replaced.  The fuel pump does work when it is wir=
ed
direct.  Is there some other relay that the alarm might have fried
somewhere along the line?  Is there still a hidden switch that has not be=
en
removed?  Is there some kind of RPM sensor that might have failed so that=

the engine will not run?  We have thus far checked all the wires and the
fuse panel and have found nothing burnt out or shorting.  Prior to the la=
st
time we hit the remote engine start button,  the car was running fine wit=
h
no problems.  Please!!! Any ideas will be welcome.   Alex3@compuserve.com=
