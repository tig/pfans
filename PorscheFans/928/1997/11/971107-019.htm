I am not an expert, but think about this, new low-end cars and older high
end cars that didnt have 4 wheel ABS always put the ABS on the front wheels
didnt they? Im also under the impression that some cars have disc brakes on
front and drums on back. Wouldnt that mean the manufacturer didnt want the
front wheels to lock up and was less concerned about the rears?
