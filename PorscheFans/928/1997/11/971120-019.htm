Hi all,
I recently had my clutch hydraulics system replaced (after the slave cylander
blew out in heavy traffic) and have decided to replace the clutch sometime this
winter since the current one appears to be original and is approaching 90K
miles.

Does anyone know the best source for the parts?  Devek will probably get my
business,
but I am shopping around. I wrote Automotion, figuring I could get a good
deal during
their sale (the clutch packages for other Porsche's seemed fairly
reasonable) but this is what I got back from them:

The regular price is $969.94, and on sale is $775.95 for 3 piece factory
Sachs clutch package.

No wonder I never buy anything from them (even though their catalog is great)!

Also, I plan to do the work myself over the holidays...I DO have the manuals
and 
have replaced clutches in an old Mazda RX-7 and some other car (don't recall
what
it was)....but I would like to know about how much time I should expect the job
to take. Car will be on stands, not a lift ( I sure miss the lifts I got to use 
while in the navy!).

Thanks in advance,

David Schultz
