Reading this thread I was concerned that a failed torque tube could 
damage the transaxel's input bearing.

While I haven't attempted to replace a torque tube, I have had my 
transaxle out. I think one could replace the torque tube by unbolting 
the transaxle and pushing it back an inch or two. Much easier than 
removal because you don't have to remove that big aluminum cross member, 
or undo the half shafts, or support the weight.
