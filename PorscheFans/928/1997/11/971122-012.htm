I guess you don't read Excellence too often, Vertex advertises in there, they
do have the best prices, and they also stock original parts (not the cheapest
thing that fits).  I just purchased a clutch kit from them, and was very
pleased with both the qualities of their parts and service.  The whole point
of this digest is to help each other out, letting other 928 owners share
valuable information and experiences, that could take years to otherwise
accumulate.  So if you've had a bad encounter with someone, warn everyone to
stay away, but on the other hand if your experience has been good, share it.
 Unless you have had dealings with Vertex, or anyone else I suggest you say
what you know Nothing.
