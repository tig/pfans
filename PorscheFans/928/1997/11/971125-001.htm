It's amazing what a good professional auto detailer (or two) can do.  When
I was shopping for my present 928, I happened to be at a local dealer's lot
shortly after a black '86 928 had been traded in.  The car was a disaster -
trash and stains all over the interior and the exterior looked like it had
never been washed - it was kind of a dull gray/black hazy color.  I stopped
by there again the next afternoon and was amazed to see the same car
polished to a brilliant shine.  Two professional detailers were still
working on it - spraying some sort of paint-like stuff on the leather seats
to cover the stains and give them a like-new look.

The car may have been sound mechanically, but considering it's appearance
on arrival, I doubt it.  Anyway, the dealer slapped a $19k price on it
(this was 4 yrs ago) and sold it fairly quickly.  I'd have been interested
in it myself if I hadn't seen it earlier.
