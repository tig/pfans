About a week ago I posted to P-fans about a hot idle problem (cold idle is
fine, warming up is fine, but hot -- after 15-20 minutes of operation) is
too high.  It'll set at 1200 RPM and then maybe drift down to 1000 RPM).
Now I'm following up on all the advice/tips etc.  I just took the aux. air
valve off to check it's functioning and now I need more help.  JP Rodkey,
are you listening? :)

Well, I followed the procedure JP gave me...  I took the valve off (mine is
mounted on the rear of the engine under the air box, so you can't
experiment with it in place).  The engine had not been run for 4 days at
this point.  When I looked down the air passage, the disk which moves to
close the passage is half open (half closed?).  When I apply 12V the disk
slowly closes the air passage.  When I remove the 12 V, the disk slowly
opens, but again to the half way point.

Here's my question:  should the disk open further to leave the air passage
completely open?  

Also, when I shake the air valve I can hear some itty bitty little
something or other rattling around inside.  I'm wondering if this sounds
screwy?  Seems to me that valves and other engine parts shouldn't make
rattling noises when shaken.

Anyway, if JP or anyone else can help I'd sure appreciate it.
