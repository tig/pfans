Dear fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

I want to pass on something I learned recently about sunroofs.

Mine had started leaking near the right front corner whenever it rained for
any extended period of time. The problem was not the seals, but rather the
nearest drain hole was plugged. I had tried air pressure to blow out the
obstruction, but it would not budge. The repair was to simply "snake" the
"cable" from the rear brakes of my bicycle down the drain. The "cable" was:
thin, strong, manuverable, and long enough. It also permitted me to apply a
"roto-rooter" action that finally unblocked the drain.

On a different note, I'm down to the last batch of 928 Frenzy polo shirts. I
want to thank those of you that bought them and ask that you let others know
how you like them. The price remains the same; $30 for M & L, $32 for XL &
XXL, plus $5 for shipping and handling.
Ask your significant other to get you one for the Holidays.

All proceeds go to the Potomac Region Porsche Club of America (I don't make
a dime on the shirts). For an address, contact me at: ed928s@erols.com

Happy motoring. Ed
