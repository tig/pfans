Things are getting a bit contentious here so I won't re-quote.  You've
all heard me go on and on about going to the track (1- day, $85 & no
tickets - how do you beat that?) so I won't restate the whole bit.
However, let me point out something on the safety of 100+ at night.

If you're going over 60 mph at night and think things are perfectly safe
in the absence of traffic, I'll bet you've never hit a deer.  I got my
first deer last year - I was going the 55 mph speed limit and I never
saw it until its head was 2 feet to the left of my fender.  I know of an
M3 recently taken out by deer in the DC area so they do exist down there
too.  Unless you've got aircraft lighting on your car, you probably
don't have enough light to go over 100.  If you do catch a deer head-on
in a 928, I fear it'll go through the windsheild and the worst will
ensue (somebody please correct this if my guess is wrong).  In our 525i,
it was a 150 lb. buck and it didn't go over the hood (>$10,000 in
repairs) so we were fine.

If you do this, I hope you've accurately assessed all of the risks -
before I hit the deer, I didn't think it was such an unavoidable
incident.  It has certainly put the fear of God in me about night
driving (especially at this time of year and in the spring).  (A 70 lb.
dog would also do some serious damage.)

Best,
Kurt
