Lemme relate recent conversation - was talking with the body man at the
paint shop that worked on my car.   He used to be with local dealer
until it went out of business, and has extensive Porsche experience
until three years ago.   Anyhow, while we were discussing various body
components, etc., he asked if I had the water in the tail light
problem?   He went on to say that in the late 80's, the Porsche field
rep happened to drive a 928, and that the car routinely had enough water
in the tail lights that you could see it slosh around when the guy
cornered.  He also stated seeing "most" 928's with that problem.

Interesting that mine seems just fine - but right now, it hasn't seen
rain, let alone a long stretch of road since last February!
