The following quotation is from 'Porsche Chronicle by the
auto editors of consumer guide'.

"Reflecting Prosche's early-Seventies research into 'long life'
technology, the steel body/chassis was protected on both sides
with the new hot-dip galvanizing process then being applied to
911s.  Moreover, brake lines were sheathed in copper-nickel
iron alloy, and fuel lines were treated with chrome and then
plastic coated".

I make no claim as to the veracity of this publication.

Yes.  I was referring to galloping, perforating rust.  I have had
much experience of this in the Kingswood.

This is fine until all the Zn has been oxidised.  I once came across
an old plough in a field.  It had been galvanized.  Where the Zinc oxide
was present, no problem. On the odd part where it wasn't there was --- Rust.

I have a small patch on the cowl where the plasiic panel that covers
the wiper mechanism was wrongly fitted, and wore through the paint.  
I appear to have surface rust there. I assume that the Zinc wore away 
too, and that once the electrons couldn't 'see' any more zinc (because 
it was covered in paint) they started on the Steel.
