I have an 88s4 and was wondering about mashing the pedal from a standstil=
l
in an AT.  I remember reading a thread about the dangers of doing that on=
 a
manual.  Something about the drivetrain not being designed to handle that=

kind of stress and there was considerable debate but no one ever mentione=
d
what the effects would be on an AT.  Leonard, Phil,  I know you guys have=

sticks but do you have any insight?

Also,  I had the opportunity to meet Phil Tong at the AX in Dublin on
saturday.  I cannot get tired of looking at the 928's.  Even though there=

were countless 911's, 944's, Boxters, 914's, and an occasional 356..,  no=

car stirs the emotions like a 928.  If you haven't got your 928 owners cl=
ub
t-shirt from Phil,  order it right away!!! It is really nice. What was
really interesting about the AX was that there were a substantial amount =
of
women racing their cars and turning in some darn good times.  My wife, wh=
o
is quite fast in cars, mentioned that racing is an even playing field for=

women.  any comments Moira? I look forward to the future events and seein=
g
more shark owners showing off their wares.  Will there be another tech
session at Devek soon?  Does anyone know?
