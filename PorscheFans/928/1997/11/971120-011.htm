One thing to know is that each headlight beam has its own fuse. Four
fuses for the two headlights, each with high and low beam. So if both
beams fail in one headlight, it almost has to be the ground connection
(brown wire). If only one beam is failing, try wiggling the appropriate
fuse - might just be making an intermittent connection.
