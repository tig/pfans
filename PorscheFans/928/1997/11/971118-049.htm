John,

I was thinking of the same thing when you mentioned location of the calipers
on the rotors.

Could it be simply aesthetics?  I know that on motorcycles I like the looks
better with the front caliper at the back of the rotor, rather than at the
front.  The rear caliper position seems to be unimportant; it looks OK just
about anywhere.

The only technical reason for caliper placement that comes readily to mind
would be the car designer's attempt to reduce the car's polar moment of
inertia as much as possible by positioning components closer to the car's
CG...but this seems like a real stretch.  Loads may have something to do with
it, but that's a little too subtle for me to figure out.  If anyone has an
answer, I'd be just as interested as you in finding out why.
