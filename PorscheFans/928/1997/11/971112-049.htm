Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

As many of you know, it is safer to drive on the track at any given speed
than on the street/Hwy at that same speed. Why you ask?! First, everyone at
the track is there for the same purpose. Second, they are all instructed on
the rules and proceedures. Third, the drivers in each particular run group
are about equally experienced. Fourth, you are all going in the same
direction. Fifth, there are experienced corner workers at each major turn.
Sixth, all cars are inspected for safety and mechanical considerations.
Seventh, all drivers are wearing safety equipment. Eighth, lower run group
students have an instructor. Nineth, passing is only permitted on straights
and only with permission from the car to be passed. Tenth, safety is stress
form start to finish. A best of all, there are no "cops" to issue citations!

If you have a need for speed, you can induldge it at the track with greater
safety than on the street. Happy motoring. Ed
