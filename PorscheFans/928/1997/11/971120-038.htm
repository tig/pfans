Holy cow, Batman! Since the 60 and 80 mph tach readings are in the same
proportion as the road speeds, it's not as though your tach is conking out
at higher engine speeds (not that 2300 rpm is high). If these readings are
correct, you either have a mysterious 2.04:1 final drive (2.20:1 stock) or
an equally mysterious 0.928:1 fifth gear (1.00:1 stock)

Stock gears and tires lead to a figure of 32.3 mph per 1000 rpm.

The idle and rev limiter speeds are right, and so constitute a reasonable
test of the tach at the low and high ends of its range. Since it's also
indicating proportional to road speed, it's really not showing any bad
symptoms. If you can arrange it, I'd be interested in seeing what a clip-on
external tach shows when your built-in tach indicates 2300.

If your tach checks out, you do (although it would be too tall a gear to
permit the engine to power the car to a higher-than-stock top speed). This
confuses me, since Porsche doesn't admit to having made more than one
gearing configuration for '87-88 US-spec S4s (no apostrophe!). Maybe others
on the list with manual-shift cars of this vintage can take a moment to
check their tach readings at 80 mph in 5th (I get 2550, Greg gets 2300) and
report back.
