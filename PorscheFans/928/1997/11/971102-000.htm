No-excuses answer:  You beat him if you were in front


Now for the excuses <heh heh>:

You raced an automatic 928 that didn't kick down to 1st gear (what for,
you *only* have a slowbra :)

You raced a S4 lookalike early car that probably had 150k+ miles but it
hung right with your '97 'Stang didn't it

You pulled a holeshot, damn you're good, Cornholio!

The 928 was just letting you run close in front to block traffic for it
/ be the laser target

Why'd you lift right when it was just starting?  928 starting to pull on
you so you got to shut down to preserve your 'win'?  Wussbag!

See, those Fram oil filter stickers are worth 50 hp!

 ***

Ok, this was all in jest (figured you could take it since you walked
into the shark's nest and that takes balls to begin with) and I could go
on but why...

Flooring it to 80 isn't much of a display of driving prowess but you
know that already. You are fortunate that there's a ton of aftermarket
mod's for your car.  We have a couple tricks our sleeves too though...


Be careful out there!
