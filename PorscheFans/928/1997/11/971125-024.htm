Well....hats off to the 928 Intl. fellas.  Great prices and great service.
 Thanks, Mark and Tom. Now if only I could get a diamond studded steering
wheel emblem....he he he.  Oh well, I guess my wife (a jewler/gemologist) can
surprise me for Christmas!  Now I know how to get rich....hooking up all my
fellow 928 owners with the same.

The 80 928 here in Raleigh, NC is in good mechanical condition.  Has
approximately 66+K miles.  The owner is asking 6-7K.....which, in my opinion,
is still negotiable.  The car has new tires...the body is in fair to good
shape, and from the looks/sounds of the mechanics....he has taken care of the
car.  If you would like more info....give me a call during the day at work @
(919)836-4452 if interested.

Oh, does anyone have a spare warmup regulator or set of manuals that you
might be interested in parting with?  Have jewelry, lawn mower, &
woman......trade?  : )~

Easy does it....
