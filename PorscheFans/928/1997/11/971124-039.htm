That's wonderful. Is there anything but Sachs clutches available for 
928's?

And I am also making suggestions. Suggestions that one be an informed
buyer in addition to being a price-conscious shopper. The questor asked
for "source". The answer was "price". If you have been following this
list closely you'll recall that 928 clutches are possibly the most
heavily revised component sold. Is "OEM Sachs" good enough? What does 
that mean?

So maybe somebody has the info and would care to post "A History Of 
Porsche 928 Clutches And How To Tell The Good From The Bad", or maybe 
there is no such thing as a new substandard 928 clutch? What components 
should a good clutch kit come with? Springs? Grease? Throw-out bearing? 
Nuts? Bolts? Instructions? Service manual errata? None of this has been 
addressed in this thread no matter what the subject field has been 
changed to.

Am sorry two somebodies think there is something wrong with my tone or
attitude but there is only so much bandwidth available in email. Had we
been discussing this face to face I'm certain we would have had better
comprehension of what each was saying. It would be understood that I'm
not looking to pick a fight or denigrate a vendor.

I too love the free enterprise competition we have in the Porsche parts
channel. Competition breeds diversity. Diversity is difference. And it
is the responsibility of the consumer to make informed purchasing
decisions else those with the strongest marketing will triumph over 
those with the best product.
