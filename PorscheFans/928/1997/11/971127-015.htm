When I broght my 928 home,I was working 6 and 7 days per week and long
hours at that, So I didn't get to drive it very much, and it sat in the
garage. I found oil, motor and power steering, on the floor. I also
found that the bottom pan was loose and held on with a tye wrap. 

I finally got time to work on the car. I built a pit in my shop to work
on my vehicles and I'm glad since I got the 928. I got the bottom pan
off and spent time rebuilding it and then started chasing oil leaks. I
began by wiping down the oil pan, and found a bolt missing, and most of
them were very loose, or at most finger tight. I put a wrench on them
and snugged them up. I was suprised to find no lock washers or built in
lock/sholder bolts. I never found the power steering leak so it must
have been coming from the pan area as well. 

Last week I pulled the belly pan again to check the new tie rods I
installed a few months ago, and found a grubby oil pan again. I checked
the bolts and many of them were loose again. I thought about using
locktite "Blue" on them but thought I'd better check around to see if
any one else is having the same problem and what they are useing.

So if anyone has a good semi-perminant (extractable)solution for this
probem I would like to know, and if any one has used "Locktite blue"
with good results. If so I'm ready to pull them all and lock them in
like it should be. 

Sorry for the run-on, I'm need to be more concise and will promis to
work in it.
