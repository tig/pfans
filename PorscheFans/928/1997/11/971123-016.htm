Hmm; I see a nice, late model Toyota in your future.

Not so! Some years ago (dating myself again), when a new VW Beetle cost
about $1600, a dealer demonstrated the comprehensiveness of their parts
inventory by putting together a complete car from parts in stock; total
retail price of said parts was, if I remember correctly, about $50,000.

I had no idea we were all delusional, or at least very inventive liars, on
this list. I see an "unsubscribe" message in your future.

>9.  It's fun to drive

Oops; did you really mean to day something positive?

>87S4/auto/white
