Greetings fellow 928 admirers:

This is going to be a somewhat windy post but I have been lurking here
for about 2 or 3 weeks of 928 digest action and am amused often but
thankful to have found many who share my appreciation of the line.

So I wake up early Sunday and check the e-mail (happenstance?) and see a
post or two about, "Why the 928?" (duh) and how these cars seem to be so
much more than the sum of their parts.  I then go out to check the tire
pressures of my two 928s (some apostrophe disagreement certainly coming
and perhaps a plural comment...but who really gives a flying **** as
this may be a good story).  

The 81 I have owned for about 16 years now (Weinrotmetallic/Black Auto)
has been my daily driver whenever I wanted, which was quite often. I had
the choice of about 4 or 5 other vehicles and the 928 always went out if
it was decent weather.  There were winters (Kansas) that saw a lot of
actual snow duty without ever a scrape.  I don't put them away for the
winter here, just keep things clean, full and charged and get them out
when it's clear enough.  But I digress...

I take off in the "red" 81 when all the air is right and fill up, adding
the octane boost that doesn't seem to matter much if I forget.  Then
it's off to the circuit I suspect many shark tamers have to make a nice
"test run" occasionally.  Well I just had both 928s balanced and aligned
and was inspired (the e-mail, remember?) to let 'em run.  About 2 miles
from my house are several new roads laying like ribbons on the flat
plains here. Eight Sunday morning there was nothing out and perfect
visability so I let the revs climb.  I am always satisfied with the
strong smooth acceleration and shifts the 3 speed auto makes with the
engine sounding just right.  For 16 years this car has been great. Yes.

The speedo pegs at 85 all too soon but near 5 grand I guess we're doing
140 and it's smooth as silk, still plenty of pull left and no sweat. 
Like the stinking cars are made to do 150 mph till they run out of gas!

Feeling great I return and repeat the process with the 88 S4 I finally
found after looking for years.  About a year (and more than a few 
thousand dollars in putting the car very right) ago I paid $20,000 to a
pal without pause for this Black/Maroon beauty with 17" OEM Cup Race
Wheels and Dunlops.  Great looking vehicle.  Every cent has been worth
it and I would do it again...perhaps a GTS.  Anybody know of a Black GT
or GTS with 5 speed?  But now I'm back on the road with the 88 making
nice noises...

I marvel at the way the gears almost shift themselves now with the
manual transaxle and know again why 928 drivers utter, "Fire the
chauffer!"  How about the way the S4 stands up real tall around 4000
rpm?  And what about those brakes?!!  Did I tell you I love these cars?
I look down and see that it's turning short of 5 grand and indicating
150 mph.  Just like the older 928, the 88 is smooth as silk and rearing
for more.  I suppose, if the final ratios are both 1:1, then I must have
been doing about 150 in both of them last Sunday morning.  Life is good.

Please don't start with a safety flame.  No one really wants to rant on
about something like that, huh?  No sweat at all, nuf said.

I'll bet many of you have similar stories (weekly) of spirited runs and
great satisfaction derived from 928s.  Mick Jagger needed one in the mid
sixties but the world would now be a different place without his vocal
angst of driving MGBs and Jags. No slam intended, I love them too but
can't drive them enough...the shop always has them.

I enjoy many of the posts and great web site, Phil. Yeah, 928s (mine)
really are forever. I suppose I could entertain the notion of finding a
good home for the 81 if the 928 Spyder came rolling up the driveway but
otherwise I'm keeping them both. 

I hope to see many of you at the Steamboat deal next July...I'm bringing
both of them.  In case you were wondering about how I could drive them
both, my local mechanic has agreed to make the trip. Is that dedication
or what?  He loves me.

I'll de-lurk again with some honest to goodness questions and some info
I have gleaned that may help some but, like so much in life, the serious
stuff can wait while we, "Do the good stuff now!"
