I have seen quite a few questions/answers here in the past with respect
to the largest and widest wheels our cars will accomodate, but what about the
opposite?
What is the smallest and narrowest wheel that can be safely fitted to a
928S4? I know the spare is 15" x 5.5"(can't recall the width just now.)

Why would I wan't such small/narrow wheels? Because winter is coming and my car
DOES get driven in the snow and ice. The recommended winter tires sizes in the 
manual don't inspire confidence in the worst conditions(even using tires
designed for only snow/ice use....chains not allowed here)

So, given that under these conditions the car won't be accelerating aggressively
or going any faster than perhaps 60mph, what narrow wheels and tires would
be best?

Thanks,

David Schultz
p.s. A friend drives his FIAT 308 GTSi through any snow that isn't too deep for
     clearance problems, so I'm not the only crazy person in the area :)
