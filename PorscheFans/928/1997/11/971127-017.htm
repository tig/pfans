I have a Momo Sport steering wheel (installed by PO) that I would like
to sell. It is $288.98 on page 26 of my Automotion catalog, plus $58.98
for the 928 hub kit. In addition, I have the Porsche emblem horn button,
which is not available from them, but is probably another $25 or so.
That's a total of about $375. Mine is as new, and I'll take $200 or best
offer, including shipping.

I just replaced a rear wheel bearing on my '86S - an interesting job.
The irritating part is that I now suspect that I replaced a good
bearing! When I started the disassembly, the axle nut wasn't nearly as
tight as expected. After I finally got the (stuck) hub out of the inner
races, which destroyed the bearing, I could still see the polishing
marks on all races and the balls. I think that the low torque on the
axle nut (the result of half-shaft replacement by PO) allowed the split
inner races on the radial thrust ball bearings to move enough to make
the bearing noise that I was hearing. Oh well, there went $56 and four
hours! I would suggest that if you have slight rear wheel bearing noise,
retorque the nut before you start major surgery. You can do that (at
least on my car) by popping the center hub cover without even jacking
the car.
