If anyone else is in the area, as in Knoxville, Atlanta, Winston Salem,
Charlotte, and maybe even Columbia, let me know and we can see about planning
a drive or meet for Saturday or possible Sunday.

In response to the above statement.........
Hey, I can't believe you didn't invite us folks from Raleigh.....boy am I
crushed!
I will be taking delivery of my 79 928 the first week of December.  In fact,
Tuesday I fly to Phoenix to purchase my new love, load it onto the carrier,
fly back, and wait for my Christmas gift.  

By the way.....for those of you who are interested.  I work for a Caterpillar
dealership that has its own Oil Analysis Lab.  Samples that are pulled are
put through an exhausting test...checking oils for contaminants, moisture,
metals, and anitfreeze.  I thought it was not accurate, but I now believe
everything that these reports state.  If you are interested in having your
oils (engine, trans, differential, etc) and coolant checked on a regular
basis.....contact me at the above address.  I am sure that I can  talk ole
Mr. Poole (the owner and avid german car lover) into giving us Shark owners
(and wanna-be owners) a great price for a great product.  For more
info...check out our website....    www.gregorypoole.com.

Hope to hear from ya'll soon....until then....keep looking for the 928 tail
end tagged with the plate "PetShark".
