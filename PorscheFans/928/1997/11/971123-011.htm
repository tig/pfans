Just a quick response to the argument that people forget to turn on
their (night-time) lights when their cars are equipped with daytime
running lights:

My wife has a '97 GMC Yukon which came with DRL's as standard equipment.
When driving with only the DRL's on...those are the ONLY lights you have
on. You do not have ANY dash lighting, save the DRL indicator. If you
drive into the night without turning on your headlights your dash will
become totally dark (except for the aforementioned indicator light). 

Forgive me for being presumptious...but I had always assumed Prorsche
drivers were interested in safe driving...and I do not understand how
anyone could possibly consider it safe to drive if you are unable to
read any gauge on your dash. Ergo, you MUST turn on your headlights in
order to see your speedo, tach, oil pressure, engine temperature (to
include everybody), voltmeter....did I leave anything out?

Some of the other arguments may hold water...to some extent...but please
spare me "I may forget to turn on my headlights at night."
