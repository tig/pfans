 Don't feel bad. It is more the exception, than the rule--at least in our 
(Porsche) circles.  I have had almost 100% good/great luck dealing with 
people/companies in this niche--*with one notable exception*.  And I 
write this because if *someone else* who had a similar experience would 
have posted it, *I* would not have fallen victim.  Let's just say that 
there is one individual on 928@PorscheFans.com that scammed me and my 
company out of $1200.  I am debating how to get this information "out," 
in a respectable, honorable way.
 I was very surprised at the lengths of lying this individual was going 
to, and more surprised to learn about his "background," after we (my 
company) hired a private detective to find out the truth.
 I just hate to see this kind of behavior go unchecked.  I think, rather 
than plaster the 'net about this cretin, I'll just respond to personal 
e-mails for those who are interested in who/what/where/when.
 Just taking the high road, I guess...
