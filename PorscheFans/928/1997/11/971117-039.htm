<<  Maybe someone has already solved this little dilemma - if so, =
what is the brand (is it Blaupunkt) and is it worth using compared to =
some of today's units.  I can't really notice a quality decline since =
the amp has been bypassed, however I did go to a CD unit so that may =
account for the improvement.   Any input would be greatly appreciated.

The factory amp is to the right of the passenger seat.  Remove to thumb
screws, slide carpeted cover up, there it is.  I took mine out, and use the
head unit power  for the factory speakers.  It runs 120 watts, rated, peak.
 So I figure it puts out about 10 average watts for each channel.  It is
adequate for the speakers that are in there.  If I changed my speakers, then
the power source would change.
