I got that ticket taken care of, but now I have another one to do.

Yep, I understand.

I thought about that, but I can't do that. I've gotten my car exactly how I
want it, I own and drive what I feel is the best car out there (for me at
least). Changing the color, putting a stock S4 wing, getting rid of the
exhaust, is something I can't do.

This car belongs in Europe, and I think I'm going to send it there. If I
get a black S4, lower it, throw on some big rims, it still gets attention
from cops, 928s are mean looking cars as is. A boxster is cute, and doesn't
really look menacing. Now I am free to do whatever I want under the hood,
as long as I keep the exhaust toned down, and that cute car will really
move with its 2,700 lb weight.

 I'm not abandoning the 928, if I was I would sell it , I'm just buying a
second Porsche that's not a 928 .
