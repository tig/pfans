Brian, I'll make sure to send you a copy of the $17,000 check which I
*will* get (at a minimum). Please forward me your address. And also, my
lawyer has been successful arguing that the Euro cars are worth *more* due
to their increased HP, sportier transaxle, and upgraded lighting.

I guess "that's the way things are" for people who are too lazy to fight
for their money. Do you think I'd pay a $4,000 premium and accept $6,000 as
total payment for my vehicle? I can easily make $20,000 selling the parts.
