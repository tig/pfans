Yes, that's the way the spacers work, and they are standard on the SE, but
I have NO idea what difference they make.  I know my wife had spacers on
the rear on her 911 race car... perhaps I'll phone her and find out why.

The thing with the SE is that all the rest of the spring rates and shocks are
apparently different, too, so there is probably more to it than that.

Philip Adamson's 928 SE has the spacers on the rear wheels.  From memory
the spacers bolt to the hubs, and the rims bolt to the spacers (Philip ???).
Widening the rear track will reduce oversteer, and increase understeer.
Good luck.
