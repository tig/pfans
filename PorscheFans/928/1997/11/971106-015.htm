Philip,

I think your post was well intentioned, there is a definite need to 
understand the risks that come with high speed travel, and 
unfortunately on many roads there will be too many risks beyond your 
control to make travel at 180mph safe.

Allow me to point out a mistake in your math, though: If you travel at 
1 mile every 20 seconds, and then brake to come to a stop within 10 
seconds, you will not travel half a mile, as you indicated. (As soon 
as you start hitting the brakes, you're no longer doing a mile in 20 
seconds, after all) If you're breaking evenly (i.e. a constant, 
negative accelaration during the entire 10 seconds), you come to a 
stop in one quarter of a mile. That is of course still a significant 
distance, and also a lot longer than most headlights will shine.

We (those of us with S4 and later) drive a car that is capable of 
nearly 180mph.  Before
you try it, here is something to think about.

At 180mph you are travelling 3 miles every minute.  That's a mile 
every 20 seconds.

To stop the 3500lbs of Porsche from that speed takes over 10 seconds. 
 (Actual stopping
time has to be guestimated based on other braking tests, but by my 
calculations it should
be around 11.5 seconds.)  And that's on a good, clean road.

This means that at 180mph you need to be looking HALF A MILE in front 
of you and be
prepared to whomp the brakes if someone pulls out.

Still want to go that fast?
