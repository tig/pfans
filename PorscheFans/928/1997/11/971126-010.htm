<<$6,000, what are we talking about, an 85' Honda?>>

Paul,
Please don't take the following message the wrong way b/c I actually
side with your opinion, but I do see what your insurance co. is
thinking.  928's being involved in accidents is one of the biggest
problems of the cars - b/c the parts are so expensive while the values
of the cars are very low right now.  It's easy to "total" one.  Now of
course your ins co is trying to get off cheaply and easily, but market
wise your 85 Euro car really is NOT worth as much as a US spec car.  And
all the mods and paintwork that you had done does NOT add value to your
car in the eyes of the ins co.  It's like adding a big stereo to your
car.  It adds no resale value and means nothing to anyone except the few
people who are audiophiles.  I don't think you should let your ins co
get away with $6K for your car, but it isn't worth $17K.  I wish this
problem could be addressed in an easy manner, but I don't think it will
be.  I just hope that I never am in the position that you are in b/c my
ins co has always been very fair with me.  I can just imagine what would
happen if I was hit in my 928.                  =(
Once again, please don't take my message the wrong way.  Unfortunately
that's the way things are.
Brian Buxton
