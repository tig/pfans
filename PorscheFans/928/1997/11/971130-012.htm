In a post two days ago Alex Gomez wrote about a starting problem.  Alex was
experimenting with his Clifford alarm system and did something that caused
the engine to not start.  Then he stripped out the alarm system, hoping to
fix the problem but it still only cranks, no start.

I installed my own alarm system and learned that one way an alarm can be
installed is to disable your ability to start the car by using a normally
open relay... in other words, if the alarm doesn't close the relay, you
don't get a spark and you don't start.  In my case, I cut a wire running
from the key switch and ran it to the alarm relay and then from the relay
back to the switch.  

So, you might trace the alarm wiring and see if there are any wires that
don't seem to go anywhere.

Different alarms are wired differently, so I'm not sure this applies to
your Clifford installation.

Good luck!
