Nope, AFAIK.  Seems to be a German thing to do it this way (my BMW is too but, in
it, air gets trapped in that blue hose to the clutch MC).  I don't use 30 psi
when I pressure bleed (15 pumps on the lawn sprayer - ?? but less than 30 psi).
As long as you don't overtighten, I don't see a big problem with a hose clamp but
maybe you want to back down a bit on the pressure.

We won't go there until we have to - this isn't it!

I've felt far too many mushy pedals after bleeding to not always be suspicious!
Now you have to wonder whether you still got all the air out!  (I go on muttering
something about the demise of the British car industry to myself.)  Seeing or not
seeing bubbles is rarely a good test of success - the pads move so little and the
pressures are so high (>50 bar as you know), that all it takes is a small bubble
to soften the pedal or change the bias.  I'm guessing that such a small bubble
could easily "cling" to the inside of a bleeder nipple on its way out of the
system.

Gotta love those computas!

Congrats on finishing the job,
