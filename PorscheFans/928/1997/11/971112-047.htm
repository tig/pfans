We have the same problem over here (although the Insurance industry hasn't

Likewise our "Driver" magazine here.

Amazing! They're starting the same line of propaganda over here.

After regular arguments in the local newsgroup nz.general regarding speed
limits (do a search in dejanews for "speed" in nz.general) I've been able
to develop (with some assistance from like-minded individuals) some (IMOH)
very good arguments against speed limits and the blanket enforcement of
same.

A group of us are actively seeking to form a lobby group in the new year in
order to put our arguments out in the public arena. NZ does not currently
have a group concerned with protecting the rights of drivers.

Cheers,
