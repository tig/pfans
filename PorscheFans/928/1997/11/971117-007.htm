Apologies in advance for asking a such a "generic/broad-based" question
especially when I'm asking the "already converted"!

I am now on my third 944 Turbo (and I've loved them all!)

I have been offered a single owner March 1995 928 GTS (Euro spec, manual
shift), 12,500 miles. The car looks like new. The only obvoius downer is
the colour (White).

I will take the car to my local Porsche service centre for a look over
and evaluation before going further - they are charging GBP 80 (approx
USD 130) for a "74 point" maintainence check - do you think this
check-out is good enough to establish whether the car is good or "a dog"
?

Are there any obvious points I should be looking out for? Hopefully I
will be able to "borrow" the car for 2-3 days before I need to make a
decision.

Any advice people can give me would be very much appreciated.

TIA
