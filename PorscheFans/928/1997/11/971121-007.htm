Andy,
Had a simular problem on my '83 this summer. The car had hesitations from about 
2500 - 4000 rpms and the power was flat from 5000 on up. I suspected it was 'unmetered' air entering the engine. I replaced the o-ring (now I'm going to get
technical) which mounts on the air flow meter and fits into the throttle body (?). Not sure if an '87 has one, but it worked for me and was a cheap fix. It was about $6(US) at a dealer.

Another area of 'unmetered' air are the intake runners. That was going to be my
next place to look.

Hope this helps,

Brian Scudder
