Some of you know I'm chasing an engine/idle problem (starts okay, as
warms up, worse until it won't run.   Sooty plugs, very rich smell).

Yesterday, installed NEW Bosch (nee: Botch?) warmup fuel pressure
regulator.   Made no difference - GRRRRRRRRRR!    I then checked the
fuel return hose at the fuel tank - book wants to check it at the outlet
of the fuel distributor, but I don't have proper fittings to make the
connection - the result is that about 1/3 proper amount of fuel
measured.   So, it appears to confirm something in fuel delivery.   I
removed fuel sender unit and inspected inside of fuel take - can see the
fuel screen on the bottom at the outlet and it appears okay and
unclogged.   There is some minor debris in the bottom of the tank, but
nowhere near enough to be agitated onto the screen, and I doubt there's
enough to clog it anyway.

So.........I'm going to disconnect the pump and recheck lines and
fittings.   I know the accumulator is working okay because it passes the
fuel system pressure test outlined in the maual.  Weeks ago, I checked
the output of the fuel pump, and it passed.  It certainly produced
proper volume, and blew out rubber hose when it passed 6 bar pressure.
Car can/will start just fine and can freely rev, but as engine warms
(e.g. fuel flow over time), loses power, runs rough, then stalls.   It
can usually be fired right back up w/o trouble, but quickly revs drop
back down, tries to run for 15 seconds or so, then stalls.

Note:   I no longer think problem is heat related - I think it's fuel
volume/flow related.

My question(s):
        1.    Anyone experience a fuel pump (I have the single pump
directly under the fuel tank system) to initially pass pressure/volume
delivery test but degrade rapidly as the engine warms up?

        2.    Can faulty fuel distributor restrict bypass of fuel (re
above test for fuel bypass/return).

        3.    Any suggestions to help diagnose and isolate problem?

Thanks in advance......any suggestions welcomed!
