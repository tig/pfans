Been reading your posts and Leonards replies, etc., and thought I'd add my 2
cents worth. 
My oil pressure guage previously read 3 bar when key was switched on, with
some tapping on the unit I was able to get it down to 2 bar, but no lower.
Checked pin #'s 2 and 4 on the electrical block by the right front fender
(under plastic cover by negative battery connection) and found the resistance
to be over 1 K ohm. Should be less than 10 ohms. (previous post said it
should be 5.2 ohms) 
After I was finally convinced that the sender was the culprit, I replaced the
oil sender about a month ago and it cured the problem. (Oil gauge is at 0 bar
with key switched on now.)  The new sender reads 9.0 ohms at the block. (read
7.4 ohms uninstalled)
The original sender was part # 928 606 203 02 with markings as follows 0-5
bar, 0.25 + 0.15 bar, 30/88, 4.87.....
this superceded to a new part # 928 606 203 01 with markings as follows 0-5
bar, 0.5 + 0.15 bar, 30/64, 10.96.
To recap, my old sending unit was at 2 bar with key switched on, at start-up
it was pegged, (over 5 bar)
warm idle was 3-4 bar, and was pegged again at 2000 rpm or so.
My new unit is at 0 bar with key switched on, at start-up it's at 4.9 bar,
warm idle is 3 bar, and then 4.9 bar at 2000 rpm or so. (guage doesn't go
over 5 bar or peg as before)
I thought initially that maybe I have an oil pressure problem, since it
doesn't go quite as high as before, but I am thinking that the above 30/64
spec on the new sender may mean that it only goes to 64 psi, which is a
little less than 5 bar. ?
Anyway, my last oil analysis shows good......No water
contamination....Chromium and Aluminum in acceptable range (no abnormal
conditions in rings and pistons)......Copper and lead in acceptable ranges
(no abnormal conditions in bearings) 
This may be more information than you need, (or wanted) but I hope it helps.
