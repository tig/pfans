Anyone know what the police forces will buy when Ford drops its big
rear-drive cars?

Yep.  Chevy is now offering its Monte Carlo with a "special service"
package to police departments.  This car is not real popular with the
boys in blue.  Neither is the Taurus that Ford is offering.  Both are
front drive econo-boxes with bigger radiators and a boosted alternator. 
That's about it.  However, the bean counter love them: cheap to buy and
operate, low power discourages chasing (thereby reducing liability),
popular at resale.  I suspect this is the wave of the future.

Chevy/GMC is also offering the Tahoe/Yukon with all the goodies:
off-road package, frame bracing, tow package, big tires, mondo
alternator and radiator, lusty 5.7 liter fuel injected, roller cammed,
hairy chested V-8.  This baby is extremely popular with cops and has the
advantage of much superior visibility in traffic vs the Caprice/Crown
Vic.  Expect to see lots more of these!

Chrysler is also offering a Cherokee package - not a real big seller.

No, I'm not a cop.
