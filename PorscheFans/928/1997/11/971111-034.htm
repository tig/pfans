I posted this before but got no response from anyone, maybe it didn't go
through correctly or no 928 wiz' know the answers.... just kidding...

I am still having trouble hooking up the radio. It gets no power to it. The
fuse in the radio is alright, but is there another fuse somewhere else?(fuse
box). Also, could it be related to the starter / ignition switch? Is there a
relay for the radio or could on be installed with amps and an aftermarket
alarm? The PO had an alarm, speakers, and amps put in all at the same time. I
removed the amps and it worked fine but a few week after I removed the alarm
and now nothing. 

Also in the ignition switch, I don't know what these wires are for,
blk/yellow wire and a blk/grn wire.I don't have the 2  black/red wires that
should go into the ignition.  
If anyone knows what those wires are I would appreaciate it.
