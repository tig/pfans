In the 28-Nov-97 digest, Alex asks for HELP! on the following:


>I have a request from all the electrical geniuses on the list.  My 88s4
>will not start.  It will crank but it will not start. I previously had an
>aftermartket Clifford system in it that had a remote start feature on the
>alarm module.  If you pressed the button,  the engine would crank but it
>would not run.  The alarm started to give me intermittent problems so I had
>a guy look at it but when we pressed the remote start feature,  the car
>cranked but would never start again.  The alarm has been stripped out and
>the car is back to stock. When I crank the engine,  the fuel pump wont work
>and I get no spark.  Both computers have been checked out and are fine.

Alex:

This may be a shot in the dark,  but sometimes the simple and abvious
aren't.  Reading the owner's manual for my '89,  there's a section that
talks about the security system.  According to that,  tampering with the car
(like trying to start it with the security engaged) will cause the system to
activate, disabling the engine.  Perhaps the system thinks your clifford
starter is trying to 'hotwire' the car, and the system is activating to
"protect" the car.

So:  Try locking the car with the key, then unlocking with the key to
disable the security system.  With luck, you will be able to start the car
now with the ignition key.  Look at yopur owner's manual to see if I am
talking through my hat-- it's happened maybe twice before...
