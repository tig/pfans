<chuckling>  Very impressive maths... the real equation is more like:

- The flashing light on top of the black-and-white car rotates at about 75 revolutions per
minute.  This means that in the time it takes you to slow from 171mph to 50mph it will
have rotated 36 times.

- If, however, you yank the handbrake on a wet road in order to fool him, then in that
same period you will have rotated up to 9 times, depending on obstacles.

- If you add all the rotations we've just mentioned you get 45, which is the number of
demerit points you'll get if your wheels were rotating at 1200 revolutions per minute
when the radar locked on you.

So based on the above figures, how much will the fine be?

Over to you, Leonard...

It works like this:

- Your engine is limited to about 6500 rpm (assuming it has power to turn
that fast in top gear).

- In top gear, the total speed reduction from crankshaft to axle is your
final drive ratio (because there is no overdrive in the transmission), here
2.72:1. This means that the axle spins no faster than 6500/2.72 = 2390 rpm.

- Your rear tires turn about 840 revolutions per mile traveled (most
Porsche sizes fall within the 835-850 range; also, tires can "grow" a
little at extreme speeds). At an axle speed of 2390 revolutions per minute,
this means the tires are moving the car 2390/840 = 2.845 miles per minute.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this makes the calculated top speed
2.845 x 60 = 171 miles per hour.

I'll leave it to you to decide how limiting that is.
