We (those of us with S4 and later) drive a car that is capable of nearly 180mph.  Before
you try it, here is something to think about.

At 180mph you are travelling 3 miles every minute.  That's a mile every 20 seconds.

To stop the 3500lbs of Porsche from that speed takes over 10 seconds.  (Actual stopping
time has to be guestimated based on other braking tests, but by my calculations it should
be around 11.5 seconds.)  And that's on a good, clean road.

This means that at 180mph you need to be looking HALF A MILE in front of you and be
prepared to whomp the brakes if someone pulls out.

Still want to go that fast?
