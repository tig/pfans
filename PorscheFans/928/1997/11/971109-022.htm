    The following was forwarded to me by a list-member who asked for
    my comments.  I don't know who wrote it (I don't generally read
    the 928 list), but I hope he finds my comments helpful:

> With every mph increase the wind resistance on the front of your
> car also increases (more like doubles I think).

    Air resistance increases with the square of the velocity.  The
    horsepower required to overcome it increases with the cube of the
    velocity.

> I remember it reading that once you get to 185 or 190 to increase
> even 1 (ONE) mph takes something like 40 hp.

    This would only be true if your car needed about 2500 HP to get to
    190 MPH.

> So, if your car will do 180 stock it will take approx. 800 extra hp
> to reach 200 mph.

    Again, this would only be true if your car needed 2150 HP to get
    to 180 MPH.

    To calculate the horsepower required to reach a particular top
    speed, just divide the cube of the desired top speed by the cube
    of your car's current top speed, then multiply by the current
    horsepower.

    For example... Let's say you have a 345-HP 928 GTS, with a top
    speed of 171 MPH, and you want to go 200 MPH.

                              200 x 200 x 200            
        Horsepower required = --------------- x 345
                              171 x 171 x 171

                              8000000
                            = ------- x 345
                              5000211

                            = 552

    So you'll need to be making over 550 HP (about 200 HP more than
    stock) to get to 200 MPH.

    In pre-S4 928s, whose coefficents of drag were higher, it'd take
    over 600 HP to overcome the aerodynamic drag at 200 MPH.

    All of the above disregards frictional losses through the
    drivetrain, and it assumes that your car is geared so that the
    horsepower peak and the top speed coincide... But it's still
    pretty accurate.
