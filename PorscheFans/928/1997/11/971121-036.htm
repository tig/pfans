Have been skulking on the 928 PorscheFans and saw your inquiry about the 94
GTS @ Metro VW/Audi. I had seen the car in the Auto Trader and finally went
by today to look at it. It is as advertised   with clean body ext & interior.
Ran well in limited test drive. They are presently asking $52,000! The owner
of the dealership is presently driving itand I don't think he is in a big
hurry to sell? The salesman did make noises of considering low $40K. He
reports it was traded in on a Audi A8, I did not ask about records or
previous owner(s).
Hope that is some help.
