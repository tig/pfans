Maybe not quite true. Did you ever wonder why the calipers on the
front brakes are mounted in back of the rotor, and those on the
rear brakes in front of the rotor? Applying the front brakes tends
to lift the front end of the car, applying the rear brakes tends
to pull the rear end down; both partially counteract the dive
produced by the braking force around the car's CG, which isn't
affected by which end of the car is doing the braking. I admit
I haven't done the numbers, but I think that the forces involved
are large enough to be significant.

It's true that Kim Crumb likes the 55 bar regulator for the track.
However, I have been seen to generate an occasional puff of smoke
from the rear tires - maybe just sloppy downshifting, maybe not - 
so I've stayed with the 33 bar regulator on my car.
