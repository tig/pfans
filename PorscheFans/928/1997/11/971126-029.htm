Paul, is this your own insurance company adjuster?  If so, you may be
toast.
However, if not....

Run, don't walk to your nearest friendly attorney and instigate a
lawsuit for the full amount it will cost to fix your car properly.  In
the case of a valuable Porsche, perhaps no amount can properly repair
the car since a car that has been wrecked may have its value permanently
impaired.  You are not required to accept ANY adjuster's offer unless
your policy has such language in it and the claim is being made under
comprehensive or uninsured motorist.  Remember that the job of the
adjuster is to minimize cost to the insurance carrier.

Another suggestion.  In the event damage is severe (and $10,000 is) I
would select the shop I wanted to do the work, deliver the car to them,
authorize them to disassemble the car sufficiently so the body man can
fully assess the extent of damage.  Photos of damage before disassembly
are a good idea.  Any request for three estimates or similar nonsense
can be truthfully be met with the statement that, in your opinion, the
car is not safe to drive in its current condition.  Let the body man
negotiate with the adjuster.  Have your attorney contact the carrier if
they threaten to total.  You may even find (with the help of your legal
representative) that you have incurred other damages as the result of
the accident - lost time at work, rental car etc.

If other party's carrier is Allstate or Nationwide or your carrier is
AAA, I would not waste any time with adjusters, just hire an attorney
that will go for the throat.  You will want a real shark in this case.

Happier days...
