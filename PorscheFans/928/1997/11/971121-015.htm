I have number 637.  I know that the exhaust system routing was slightly =
modified around #1000.  The standard Brose kit does not fit without =
tweaking.  I've heard this is only the case under #1000.  I believe the =
modification was made to accommodate changes to the drive train.  There =
must be someone out there who is more familiar with this than me.  I'm =
most likely the least mechanical on the list. It might be discussed in =
one of the historical record books.  Phil has the most complete versions =
I've ever seen but I can't recall the name.  Phil, if you read this I'm =
referring to the one you have everyone sign.

Subject: Early cars #11

Well, I have #60, and I dont think its worth a darn sight more than any
other car out there.
The really nice thing about it is that its really easy to memorize the =
VIN#
9288200060.

One thing I would look into before buying this car though, my dealer
mentioned one time, when I stopped in to pick up some fuel filters, that =
I
was lucky to not have one slightly earlier. He seemed to be under the
impression that some things, such as the fuel system, had been slightly
modified around car #55.  I dont know if there is any truth to this, but =
it
might be worth looking into. I would imagine it is possible that if they
only made 50 cars with a certain type of fuel system that parts would be
hard to come by!

Does anyone know about this?
