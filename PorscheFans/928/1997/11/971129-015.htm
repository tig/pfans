Hi All,

        I am currently selling my 928 and I figured this would be the best
place to do so. 

1984 928s RED with cashmiere leather in excellent condition in and out. Has
AC, Power windows,brakes, and is an automatic with a sunroof. The car also
has new battery, and brakes. The car has Gold 3 piece BBS rims and newer
tires on them. Unfortionately I am selling my 928 because I have to many
vehicles and one has to go. I am asking 10,000 bob for this super dependable
car.

If anyone is interested or has any questions please send them to:
saphy@gte.net   any responses will be answered and I will respond as soon as
possible.

Thanks for the help in trying to sell one of my cars.
