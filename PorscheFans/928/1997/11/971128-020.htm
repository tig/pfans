I've got one somewhere. Picked it up for a couple of bucks at a flea
market. Its good for pointing out what end of the car has the engine,
how many sparkplugs it has, and it takes 8 quarts +-1 to change the oil.
Am pretty certian they have a picture of the hole you are supposed to 
pour the oil in. Also a picture of a dipstick with an oil line between 
the "full" and "low" marks.

As I remember is 95% boilerplate Chilton. Ie: pictures of dirty
sparkplugs, etc.

Saw somebody had Genuine Porsche Owner's Manuals for about $20 
recently. You'd be better off with one of those.

However the 9-volume set of manuals was $275 or less from
928-International and/or Devek. Covers all years. If you're serious
about a 928 you might as well buy the real service manuals first. Change
your mind later, then $275 is a whole lot less than you might loose if
you had bought the car and decided to sell. OTOH you could probably sell
your new unused (read only, no dirty fingers) manual set on this list
for $200 pretty quickly.

To the previous response:

If anyone has the 9-volume set, which is greasy fingered, smudged, but is
still able to be read and comprehended.....I am offering 150.00 cash.  In my
previous years, I was a technician for Caterpillar, and a dirty, filthy parts
or service manual means that the information is correct....and not just a
bunch of bullshit in bound form.

Oh, by the way fellas, I talked with my wife....and she said that if I had
enough interest in emblems, rings, etc.  that she would cast some protos and
see what we might like (hood emblem....14K with gems for the emblem, horn
insignias, mans rings, pendants.....whatever.) If ya'll would be interested,
let me know.
