You think the Porsche engineers had all the fun when they started hiding
those brains & controllers throughout the 928? heh heh!

There are plenty of ways to tackle the aftermarket amp mount... some
stealth, some reversible, some totally 'hey it's my car' approach.

1.  If your model year has the underdash trays, try the passenger side
tray!  You can cut out the rear of the tray for extra mounting room.  As
a plus, the glove box a/c hose can be re-routed (or T'd if you're so
inclined) to provide a/c to the amp as well!  Pick your amp wisely as
there's only room for one.  For the '84 I chose a Rockford Fosgate 4.6x
running all four channels, plus a sub in mixed mono/bridged off the
rear.  More than enough decibels and if I wanted more I could've wired
all mains in 2 ohm and added even more speakers.

2.  Spare tire well (w or w/o the spare).  This seems to be where most
choose to mount the amps fairly painlessly, though with the higher
current amps you might not want to mount them upside-down due to cooling
probs (check the mfr. data for proper heat sink orientation).  John
(?)  already mentioned a novel way around this by adding a cooling fan! 
If you are a total competition nut then go ahead and water-cool your
amps, this is the 928 shark tank afterall!

Watch your a@@ regarding the close proximity to the battery - any
venting of battery gases + sparks will spell trouble ie. exploding
battery syndrome.  Remove the battery during install just to be safe. 
The gas tank is sealed but do not drill *anywhere* near it!!!  Matter of
fact you better check in/around/underneath before you drill anywhere
lest you go through wiring/hoses/etc.  Big Bummer you know!?!

I'm considering this location right now for the GT, with a plywood cover
instead of the stock plastic spare cover, motorized actuator or one of
my old hood struts & hinges but the roll bar purchase takes precedence
first.  (kinda redundant like saying fast 928, heh heh).  Most times I
have the stereo way low so I can hear the engine & road noise instead
anyways!  (Weird reason to like D40's I guess)


3.  Rear passenger seatbacks!  For a truly custom look, after you mount
the amps to the seat backs, also mount a 'spacer' board with cutout for
the amp & wires to achieve that flush mount look.  Your choice whether
to cover with matching leather or carpet.  Please keep in mind future
rear passengers & crash safety by *not* using extra long screws in the
seat back!

4.  False trunk flooring - 1/2 or full.  This is very hardcore but
definately slick.  Loads of room for amps/X-overs/tools/subs/neon/etc. 
Won't make getting to your battery/spare/tools easy but still possible. 
High weight is another factor but the setup should be pulled for racing
duty anyways.

5. Rear passenger 'glove box'.  Another cool hiding place.  You can
hollow out the inside if need be for extra mounting space and still look
stock from the outside.  Cooling can be a problem with the lid closed
unless you get a rear a/c console with the vents already in place.

6.  Passenger doors!  Actually, inside the armrest storage bins.  This
one is really way out there but another custom approach, especially if
you have soo many amps you have run out of space to mount them.  You're
on your own here.  I'd rather see you use these as sealed mid-range
enclosures, that'd be pretty trick!

7.  Not afraid to surface mount on an exposed area?  Use the sides of
the trunk area! Though the next owner might bemoan this mounting
location, especially if you've drilled into leather, the site of dual
amps (PPI's?) , one on each side might actually become a selling point. 
Make sure you tint the windows first otherwise it would look like a
candy store to thieves.

8.  False rear passenger floor.  Might obstruct front seats depending on
design.  Again on your own here.

9.  Super custom approach?  Open up amp, remove components, and mount
inside center armrest!  Holy cow!  Yes you heard right but you better
know what you're doing since this voids any warranties immediately.  And
if you like to crank better add a full-time cooling fan lest you roast
your elbow!  Heck, you might re-engineer the entire center console and
have one custom built out of clear or colored plastic, with proper
cooling, lit by neon?, and still have padding on the top!

10.  Last one (and I could go on!):  Mount amp to fuse/relay panel
cover.  Hey it's wood!  Again pay attention to cooling since it will be
covered by carpet.  True, this approach will reduce foot room but better
the passenger than the driver. heh heh.

And with that I wish you good luck & a custom install.  We haven't even
talked about speaker location yet - another huge topic.  Just don't pry
those door grills off ok?  They screw onto the drivers, believe it or
not!

Make us proud!
