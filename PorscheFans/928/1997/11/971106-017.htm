ON 11/5/97: STAN CLAYTON WROTE
Subject: Kudos for Rob Gold
For the past several months my wife and I have been blasting around the
southwest in our white/tan '86 5-sp, having entirely too much fun, and I'd
like to extend heartfelt thanks to Rob Gold ('86 5-sp) here in Tucson for
steering us towards the most amazing car on the planet!  We met last summer at
a bookstore while (I was) looking at the latest Dupont Registry and got to
talking about dream cars.  I confessed that I was considering a 308 GT4, had
driven one, and really liked it.  He then told me about his adventures seeking
his dream sports car, and that after (considering) a 308, had bought a 928
instead.  I confessed that I knew little about them, but that after driving a
friend's 944, had decided to look further...  Whereupon he laughed and
explaned the differences between 4-cylinders and 8-cylinders in the most
graphic terms!

His 928 was parked out front, so I went out and looked it over.  When I came
back in, he told me about a low mileage '86 model on consignment at a lot just
a couple of miles from where we were talking.  After a brief look I took my
wife back for a test drive and we were hooked.  Following Rob's sage advice we
reviewed the car's maintenance history with the
shop that has done most of its work, Radmacher Porsche Service, here in
Tucson.

With new Bilstiens, water pump, timing belt, and a host of smaller things done
in the past year, Dave Radmacher was confident that the car was in the
ballpark at its $12,500 asking price.  Rob Gold agreed.  When I offered them
our '93 Bronco ($10,000 wholesale blue book) and a grand, they accepted!

Thus far we've been all over Arizona, and made a trip to Palm Springs with no
squawks.  The 24 MPG at 80 MPH is easy to take.  But the icing on the cake is
that the insurance is just $15 (Fifteen!) more than the Bronco every six
months.

Okay, here's the downside.  Since I was considering spending twice that for
the right 308 GT4, I figured that I would talk my sweetie into spending the
balance on upgrades to prep her Teutonic Toy for the PE 100!  Wrong-oh, moose-
breath!  Oh, well.  Gimme time, gimme time...

Anyway, hope I'm not being too long winded.  Just had to share my neophyte 928
experience.  Thanks again, Rob, for steering me to this incredible car!

AND PATRICK M. WROTE:
Subject: Stan and Rob in Tucson:
My parents just recently retired in Tucson. They live off of Reddington Rd.
about 1.5 miles before it turns into a dirt road and heads upward. Wentworth
Rd. I was out there last December doing all of the MTB trails around. For
mountainbiking, that area rocks!  Anyway, how fast can you make it up the
Catalina Hwy? That's a 928 road if there ever was such a thing.

Welcome to the list, Stan & Patrick!  The 928 folks on PorscheFans are far
more active and fun than any of the other lists.

STAN: Glad to hear things are working out with your beast ('tho I must admit
envy, as I paid a lot more and had to go to Virginia for mine, which isn't as
nice as yours.)  When I first saw your car I called the dealer for info and he
offered me a finder's fee.  Guess I should have taken him up on the offer!
What tires have you chosen and how do you like them?  Where did you go for
your alignment and what did it cost?  Does your car have the optional limited
slip differential?  And, no, you're only being long winded if you have some
sport seats to sell...

PATRICK:  Yep, Catalina Highway (for you non Sonorans, 40 miles from downtown
to 7,000+ feet, through nine different climatological zones, skiing from
December through April!) is one monster road... if you can ever get a clear
shot.  ("I love the smell of boiling brake fluid in the morning. It smells
like... Victory!")  Your "mutant" sounds, well, interesting...

BOTH:  I'm tired of the SF and East Coast landsharker's having all the fun!
Let's get together plot some mayhem!  I've counted more than two dozen 928's
in town (metro population 750k) so maybe we can get something going.  Post me
& we'll see what happens.
