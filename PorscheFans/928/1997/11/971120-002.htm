hey, again, it's not a bug it's a feature!  just another clue that yes
the doors are locked and you are tucked safely inside.  

Next fun test, tilt your head 'just so' and voila - no more beeping! 
Silence! 

The 928 has some weird acoustics.  Jim and I did some informal SPL
measurements with one of his sub-enclosures and saw a huge change in
meter readings depending upon which way the drivers were pointed, and,
where the sensor probe was pointing.

> but i usually have my stereo up anyway:-)

Cool. I admit to enjoying a good stereo 'thump' session but most times
than not I don't even need a radio.  Hmm, might be one reason for that
brief traffic ticket spell I had... Porsche V8 just sounds so damn good
going through the gears!

PT
ps. my turn signals are silent (thank god, I always felt click indicator
was kinda tacky)
