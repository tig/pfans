I always thought this kind of comment was paranoid, but I actually had a
secondhand experience that tells me its not.
 (Background on my reason for thinking it was paranoid, I was telling my
Dad one of my near-miss stories where I was doin 115-125 in my 924 and I
saw someone getting onto the lonely highway about 1/4 mile up ahead and
quickly decelerated to 75 ... of course it turned out to be a cop, who
didnt pull me over because he was apparently going over 75 and I stayed
behind him - anyway my Dad yelled at me about how stupid I was and said
'what if a deer jumps out!' of course later that month I found out that
when he was 16 his first car was a Jag Dropped head coupe and he lost his
license for doing a 100mph freeway race... couldnt get insurance until he
was 20 so i'm told.)

Anyway, I worked at a motel in East El Cajon, one of the first real
city-type areas you will hit if you are pulling a late night haul from
Arizona. So we would get a lot of truckers and people visiting SD who
thought they could make it to SD in one night and got too tired to
continue. Anyway, a cab brought three young ladies in at about 1am one
night, in talking to them i found out they were coming in from AZ. I asked
them what happened to their car and they said they hit a cow on the freeway
doing about 75. Now I couldnt imagine how that could take their car off of
the road. Sure the cow wasnt going to make it, but how could it kill the
car? Well the answer to my question came the next day when the flatbed
brought the car into the motel parking lot. It was pretty gross to say the
least, it was a honda civic SI (AKA honda CRX) and the windshield came up
to just about the front of the car. One of the wheels had been torn off the
car and the other was like a lazy eye dangling off at a cockeyed angle. If
there hadnt been quite a bit of blood on the engine/ hood i would have
thoght the CRX encountered a brick wall and not a cow.
