Glenn - At the last 928 tech session held by NER/PCA, there was some
discussion of tensioners. It is strctly a thermal expansion compensation
device, BUT the aluminum engine grows a LOT when heated, so it neeeds
to work. Oil doesn't circulate through it, but is in intimate
contact to help conduct engine heat to the thermostatic disks, which
do the work. The recommendation, as I recall, was to replace any
damaged (cracked) disks, replace the gasket and dust cover, and 
remember to bleed the thing. A whole lot cheaper than replacement.
There are 35 of those disks in there, but likely no more than a few
will be bad.
