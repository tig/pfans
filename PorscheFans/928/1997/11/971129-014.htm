In the 11/28/97 Digest, I think I correctly read where you said:


Subject: Insurance 

>  Lets say there is a certain person that bought a 928s and has a loan
>through a credit union and because of this loan must carry full coverage.
> Now lets say this same car is out of service for a few months because of
>some maintenance that needs to be done.  Would anybody at this credit union
>find out if coverage was reduced to liability during this time?  This
>hypothetical vehicle would be lets say.... insured in chicago and licensed in
>Illinois and lets say a nice place for a credit union would be in the
>Tulsa/Dallas area.  This person in this hypothetical situation is willing to
>take the risk of some knuckle head crashing into him when he takes the car
>out occassionally for a test drive while only covered by liability. This
>person realizes they would have to pay the loan off even if the car went to
>928 heaven.
>Would anybody find out?


My ex SO is a credit union president, and contributes the following--  The
loss payee on the policy is the credit union.  Whenever the coverage is
changed or cancelled such that the credit union is exposed, the insurance
carrier notifies the credit union.  The policy at this credit union is to
pick up the coverage and bill the member for it.  In addition, you may be
asked to pay off the loan in full if it's determined that you intended to
defraud the credit union.  It is certainly in the insurer's best interests
to continue to carry the coverage, so that interest is best served by
notifying the loss payee.


My opinion:  The savings realized by cancelling the comprehensive/collision
coverage is negligible.  While your risk of being hit is reduced or
eliminated while the car is being serviced,  it is still subject to theft or
vandalism.  Perhaps the exposure in the shop's lot is greater than at home
in the garage, too.  I don't know what your comprehensive portion is, but a
three month cancellation of just that part saves me less than $100.  With
luck on my side as it always is,  something would happen.  It just does...


Like all insurance,  you are gambling that you will crash the car while the
underwriter bets that you won't.  You lose your ante no matter what, and the
carrier can raise the stakes at will, especially if he sees that you are
getting bad cards dealt to you.
