I disagree with the line "Radar is Absolute" because all Radar units must
be calibrated and certified on a regular basis.  Furthermore, these units
must have a certificate demonstrating when they were last checked. You can
ask to see it, and should verify the expiration date on the certificate. 
An expired certificate usually gets you off.

With regards to the troopers estimating speeds, they sometimes try to get
you to admit to them what speed you were going (this is when they raise
their voice and ask you to come and sit in their cruiser with or without
the cuffs on).  Be very careful, as they can get very very insistent and
intimidating - a good answer is the most ambigous one you can come up with
(ie no I do not know exactly at speed I was going because I had my eyes on
the road, however I was trying to keep it below 90)
