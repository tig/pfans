 The two tickets, which I did not contest, cost $125, but the net cumulative
three-year effect on my insurance was (please sit down) $3,000!"

Yikes!  Are the insurance companies back-handing the Police over there?

     ==================================

Afraid not, Andy.  This is just another example of hungry commercial types
capitalizing on opportunities that government types are too dull to see.

We do have a relatively huge federal bureaucracy which, along with insurance
industry funded lobbyists, aggressively support the paranoids' fears to
support this situation (e.g., "speed kills," despite massive evidence that,
no matter what the posted limit, the vast majority of drivers will find and
maintain a reasonable speed on any road and in any conditions).  The American
magazine CARandDRIVER has done an excellent job over the past few years
exposing this unelected mob and their hysterical lies.  The latest
Goebbels-esque big lie is that 28,000 of our nation's annual 41,000-ish auto
fatalities are a result of "road rage."  See Andrew Tobias' book "The
Invisible Bankers" for a very readable, balanced and enjoyable expose on
insurance industry tactics.

Wow, 57 posts in one day, with no sport seats or Zymol.  Is this huge, or
what?!
