I just bought a 91 928S4 with 50,000 miles on it.  Just had the timing belt
and water pump replaced, as well as leaking power steering line.  Now it
turns out that the engine oil cooler is leaking.   Anyone have experience
with changing one of these?  Also the dealer quoted me $1000 for the "Luggage
Boot Cover."  Anyone know of used one for considerably less?
Thanks

Rebbe:
Is it the oil cooler leaking or is it one of the connections/fittings?  If
the former, contact DEVEK, since you may need a new radiator as well
(depending on the year of your 928).  Devek has a
better-than-stock/cheaper-than-replacement/probably-more-reliable-than-used
aluminum (not plastic) radiator for sale.  The unknown is whether or not you
have one of the combined rad-oil cooler-ac units.  I can't speak to the bad
connections issue.  A second opinion on possible fixes is worthwhile BEFORE
taking the expensive replacement route.
An experienced 928 (not just Porsche) mechanic is crucial to long-term
happiness!

Sorry, no one has yet found a source for new or used "luggage boot covers,"
let alone a cheaper one.  (Hey, aftermarket vendors, this is what we
capitalists call an "opportunity"!!!) The design, if you haven't seen one, is
nothing special: fabric, rods and bungee-style cords with plastic locknut
connectors.  There is no "window shade" type roller, which even cheap
hatchbacks have.

When you fixed the power steering line leak did this affect the weight/feel
of the steering?

Since your car is an S4 and not a GT, do you have the autobox?

Welcome to shark-dom and the 928 list!  Don't forget to visit Phil Tong's

P.S.
I once saw, in my native Detroit, a VW Rabbit where the owner had removed the
final letter of the "Rabbit" name badge and replaced it with the Star of
David  ~;^-}=

P.P.S.
I heard of a rabbi who did social work in a tough South Philadelphia
neighborhood.  He drove a beat up old Toyota Land Cruiser.  On the tailgate,
where "TOYOTA" is spelled out in large raised letters, he had painted over
the first "T" and the final "TA," leaving just the "OYO" in the middle.  He
also had a sliding plate over the "OYO" which let him cover any one letter at
a time.

Therefore, when on his rabinnical duties the truck said "OY"  When serving at
the community center the truck said "YO"  In the very toughest neighborhoods,
he selected "O O"
