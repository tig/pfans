My '85 window sticker had a list of items included in the car; including
"widened rear track."  This referred to the spacers I assumed.  I don't
believe it was an option but I could be wrong.  It helped to provide the
car with better lateral support!! (the car was black, a sports car, but not
covered in leather)

Also, I couldn't help but think about the latest discussions as I pulled up
next to an NSX on the Tollway this morning (in Dallas the Tollway is a
giant 50 cents/ten mile parking lot).  I know which car I would rather be
driving.  A Porsche is different than any other car and I will replace my
928 with some form of a Porsche whenever its time comes.  There is no
substitute for the driving experience.  BTW, has Acura fixed that
NSX-replace-the-tires-every-3,000-miles problem?
