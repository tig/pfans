Someone posted a message a few days ago requesting a wheel alignment shop in
the Portland, Oregon area.

A coupleweeks ago, my son had his '83 928 aligned at a shop on 7301 N.
Lombard, Ph. 286-1669. He was very pleased with the results. The mechanic
that did the alignment grumbled a little when my son handed him a copy of the
specs from the factory manual, and told him to do it right. But for he worked
at it about 1.5 hrs. until he got it correct, and the car drives nice now. I
think it was $59.95 for front & rear. I am planning to take mine there soon
as I can arrange. The last shop I took it to said it was impossible to align
as exacting as the Porsche specs require.
