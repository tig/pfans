     Phillip:
     
     excellence Magazine is neither a dedicated 928 magazine nor a local 
     Porsche club magazine.  It is a dedicated Porsche magazine and of 
     course 90% of what is written concerns that other Porsche (the fine 
     automobile with the engine in the wrong place that accelerates really 
     fast). It is glossy, contains dozens of ads for companies selling 
     after-market Porsche stuff, has excellent technical forums and 
     frequent coverage of various racing events.  It also has a good 
     measure of color pictures, usually of 911s and Boxsters.  There is 
     also a section near the end with a few dozen small black and white 
     pictures of cars for sale (most of which seem to be overpriced) that 
     is fun to study.  There are occasional articles regarding the 928 and 
     it just so happens that the December issue has 3 very interesting 
     articles that talk about the 928.  See my Oct. 28 post for more 
     details.  I would imagine that they would be happy to send it to you 
     in New Zealand, they list their foreign rates as $27 per year (8 
     issues).  Their phone number and address follows.
