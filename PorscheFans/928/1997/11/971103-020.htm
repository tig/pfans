okay... once again i put finger to key and try to dispell the mythes of the
universe.
i had several cars with brakelight cutouts. i would install a red
monitorlight that would be on when the brak lites were off. good reminder.
it saved me from a lot of cops, but its  best use was during cat and mouse
games on the backroads. i would get in front and leave the lites on till
the guy chasing would start to rely on my brake lights to judge turns...
then, once you have them hooked, on your next turn, turn em off. whalaaaa
he in into the grass. now if he is your friend,  make sure it is a field
with no fences or trees and go help him get out... laughing your ass off.
if it is some jackoff that you  dont know and that was just jerking you
around when you cut himoff and he started to chase you, well, you deciede
how much damage he will encounter. i used this little trick the most when i
was a 4 wheeler. very effective when cops are chasing you off road. also it
is nice to have a total tail light shuttoff as well as brake, and a license
cover...ahhh the days of reckless youth...

now, for radar and instant on in particular, i have a valentine it is the
best. not an updated one, but still a great unit. well the local cops are
friends of mine and there is a contest to see how fast they can peg me. the
record is 80+ in a 30. some real neat curves near my house. but i digress
as usual.  well, when they go thier new instant on we took it out for a
test run. and i did flying passes and we did tests to see how much i could
shave off before they got a lock. well the best could manage was between 20
and 30 mph, and they were able to watch the meter run down before it
locked. so for what it is worth, that usually wont get me into the posted.

you now i just have a tab on my roll bar and i just bolt my minicam to the
tab. with car electricity it works great. yes phil i still have to sent the
tapes.

as for the cobra, they are a lot of bang for the buck. i think the king of
that now is the new corvette. what a deal. the old vettes and the mustangs
though are not as solid in other catagories. for example, they lack brakes.
i used to run at blackhawk a lot, and once i got s4 brakes, and pagid pads,
 i would simlply take all mustangs and vettes as deep in as i could every
corner i could. after about 5 or 10 laps, they would be without pedal. by
the end of the day they would be without pads. this definately slows lap
times... more off course excursions too...of course thats how i was when i
just had stock 79 brakes and metalmasters. i would use up a set of pads in
one day [ about 3 hours run time] with the pagids on s4 brakes, i could go
all season.

and what is all this stuff about autocrossing... that is so hard on the
car. i liken autocross to premature ejaculation, sure it felt good, but to
wait an hour for 40 seconds of thrills..... give me a road course any
day...actually forget the road course, get me the girl that will go all
day.... what is up with these guys that say racing is better than sex...
who are they sleepin with...

gday yall
