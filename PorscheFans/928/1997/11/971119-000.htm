Little Beavis,
Hi, how ya doing?
So sorry I did not get back with you about the thing in Indy. Bummer that no
one
showed up. Nasty weather along with helping a friend on his wifes car
prevented me from attending.
Now, lets talk about good news.....I'm happy for you, in that you seem to
have found a an 89' GT worthy of putting in your stable. (It must be nice,
otherwise, I'm sure it wouldn't be considered as a replacement for your
current 928) Sorry about about the radiator woes. Does it really run
noticeably better than the 87'? Differences that you like better or worse
than the S4? (I know the differences between them, I'd just like to hear a
comparison from your knowledgeable self.)
Saw on post also that you put a clutch in the 930. I will probably do that to
my S4 this winter. BTW....You still owe me a ride in that beast! 
Oooh, I bet the GT may give it a run for it's money. 
You da' Man. 
Regards,
Greg S.  
PS.....applied for plates today........ 928 8U2
