I've just figured it out... it's Porsche executing a cunning plan to re-introduce the 928!!  It's so
simple it's brilliant!!  The 996 has a water-cooled engine and a body that's slowly but surely one
more step morphed toward the 928.  I wonder how the progression will go:

996 mk2 - move to a rear engined V6 and popup headlights
996 mk3 - move to mid engined and introduce the hatchback
996 mk4 - increased to a V8 and moved further forward... a bad model due to the engine being IN the cockpit
997 mk1 - more rounded off and the V8 is now in the front... somehow people still see it as a 911 derivative
928 S5   - gotcha

looking at the new Motor Trend mags pics of the newest version of 911, a
few things come to mind.  First, the rear end, especially the tail lights,
look amazingly like our 928's!  Also, the front headlights over the years
tend to angle back more and more- like our 928's.  In addition, look at all
those creature comforts now in the new 911- hmm, like our 928's.....  Let's
face it, they should have just kept producing the 928!

Bingo! This would help Porsche deal with the problem they face in big-time
racing, in which the Mercedes-Benz GT-1 car is much faster than the
Porsche, not least because of...that's right, its big, V-format,
water-cooled engine! Where do you think Porsche could find one of those?
