In a word, no. In more words, not even slightly, because aluminum doesn't
behave this way. Those big airplanes we fly around in are all made of
aluminum and loss of rigidity is not an issue there, even over decades. The
periodic inspections required by licensing authorities are concerned with
spotting cracks before they spread.

This got covered at length on this list a few months ago when this foolish
article first appeared.
