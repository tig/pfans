Thanks. I couldn't remember the current track number and I believe that
you're correct about the standards. I've been chasing and studying these
current tracks for a few weeks while solving the electrical needs associated
with hooking up the chevy motor to the 928 chassis. I've followed so many
tracks and "T" connectors and fuse panel points that I'm getting pretty
good at this. It took me a little while to understand how to decipher the
continuation marks because I think one of them is wrong! Probably a typo.
Anyway, I've had to trace and modify alternator, fuel pump, ignition, starter,
condensor fan, oil sending unit and water temp unit connections and some 
other connections as well. I also had to debug a lighting problem that ended 
up being a loose ground. One loose ground can cause the most bizaar behavior!
Remember the movie, "Arachnophobia"? Take a look at the backside of a 79's
fuse panel sometime.
