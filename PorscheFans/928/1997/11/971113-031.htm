I was currently checking out an 86 Porsche 928S in NJ.  I live in NYC myself.
 It is automatic with 143K miles.  However, the car seems to be in excellent
condition both mechanically and physically.  The guy just put in a new ac,
water pump and timing belt.  He kept the car well maintained and he is the
second owner.  I was going to get it mechanically checked out.  Does anyone
know anywhere around here I should take it(NYC/NJ area)?  Also, if the car
checks out ok and I keep excellent care of it, can I be pretty sure that I
won't have big repair bills?  Please post any opinions you have.  Also, what
is the book value of this car?  Thanks.
