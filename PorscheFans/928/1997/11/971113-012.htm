Steve,

In the caveat emptor vein . . . early 928s have no place to install a 
"performance chip", exept maybe with the spare tire.    Their injection
 systems are strictly mechanical.    Testimony to the contrary is utter
 crap.    I would wonder about the rest of the car . . . and what they told
you . . . 

Watch your back.   

Dave


>I am going to pick up a 1979 928 next week and am really excited!!  It has
