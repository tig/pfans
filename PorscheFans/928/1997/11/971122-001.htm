Dear Sharkers:

It is snowing here again this Saturday morning.  My 928 is sitting patiently
in the garage, having not been out in two weeks.  I am hoping that this
stuff will turn to rain, and wash away, as it should, since I can see the
ocean from where I sit.  Anyway.

I have had some thoughts on lighting and deer and such.  Quite a few years
ago, I sold driving and fog lights as a hobby business.  I was involved in
rallying and other car fun stuff at the time, and found that there was never
enough light at night.  So, Here's a question:

Has anyone replaced their S-4 or later headlights with the European version?
I find the headlights on my 87 S-4 to be ok, but only that.  They are very
large, which helps, but are hampered by having a US beam pattern, and
without the driving lights to assist them, they would be inadequate.  Bear
in mind that I live in rural Maine, where the nights are DARK,a nd street
lights somewhat sparce compared to any metropolitan area.

One night on my way back from the big city of Portland, I was traveling
along at oh-dark-thirty in the Shark's predecessor...85.5 944...at about
eighty something.
Rural road, hilly but with good lateral visibility.  The car had Hella Euro
7" headlights, and night lighting was excellent.  Came over a rise very
fast, the car light on its wheels, and RIGHT THERE, just below the crest,
was one of the biggest porcupines that I had ever seen (I think).  Poor
creature never knew what hit him.  I took him with the left corner of the
spoiler, which was merely the luck of the draw, because there was NO time to
DO anything except say, "Oh.....!"

I will bet that you didn't know that porcupines absolutely explode when hit
by a Porsche missle traveling at warp 6.5.  Oh, well, nearly a thousand
dollars worth of damage to the spoiler and the fog light.....and when they
did the next oil change they pulled quills out from above the drive shaft
and transmission.  At least I saw what I hit.

Three weeks ago, at high noon, I was driving back in the rain, when the
biggest cow moose and her yearling calf trotted across the road in front of
me. She was as big as (no lie) a full size van, and the calf was bigger than
my Audi wagon.
Thus, you see why I am very concerned about seeing at night.

Brighter bulbs are not the answer (although they help).  The problem is the
beam pattern of the lens.  The 928 headlights will provide tremendous light,
and I suspect that the Euro units will be truly wonderful.

Oh yeah, one more thought.  For any of you who are trying to add bigger
bulbs...100 watts or more, be VERY careful.  They will draw quite a bit more
amperage, and I think that to go to bulbs with higher wattage than stock
could pose a problem for the harness.  I STRONGLY suggest that anyone
wanting to use brighter bulbs, run a heavier wire to the high beam side,
through a new, separate relay, thus requiring the switches and basic wiring
to draw no more current than the elves originally intended.  (I once sold a
set of European headlights to a friend for his Subaru...he changed the
wattage of the bulbs, and melted his headlight switch, wires and
connectors....nearly cooked the whole damn car.  Thank god, I told him not
to do it.).

Guess it has to be European headlights for the Audi wagon, though.  There is
not other good solution, and the standard US versions are useless (89 200).
YOu dont want to know how much those are.....that's why I have put it off so
long.

Enough for now.  Thanks for you patience with all this guff on Saturday
SNowing MOrning!  My Shark is shivering....!

Roger
