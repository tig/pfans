Hi all!!

I'm hoping one of you has had a similar problem, successfully resolved it,
and can point me in the right direction.

My '84 928S 5-spd has just recently developed a hot idle problem that's got
me stumped.  There are basically three conditions for an idle:  cold,
warming up, and hot.  Here's what I've observed:

Cold:  Engine idles at 1,100 to 1,200 RPM, smooth, no problems.  

Warming Up:  After about 1 minute, engine goes to about 700-750 RPM.  Idles
smooth with a very slight fluctuation (always done that, no problem as far
as I'm concerned).  Seems to stay this way for about 15-20 minutes of city
driving.

Hot:  This is after the engine gets good and hot.  Idle starts to creep up
(every time I stop it sets a little higher).  Finally it caps out at about
1,200 RPM.  At first it will slowly decrease to about 800 RPM as I sit at
the stoplight, but as the commute progresses the decrease is less and less.
 Finally, after about a 30 minute drive the idle will sit at 1,200 RPM and
stay there.

Here's the problem:  this is not good for my clutch!

I've done some preliminary checking.  The throttle cable is not binding and
the throttle body micro switches are opening and closing as they should.

I'm absolutely clueless and am so frustrated I'm getting ready to shoot the
old girl (my car, not my wife).

HELP!!!!

TIA
