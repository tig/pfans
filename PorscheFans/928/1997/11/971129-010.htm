In light of recent posts of those looking for a 928
I noticed these interesting ads cruising through traderonline.com for various reasons:

First and clearly most interesting:
1987 PORSCHE 928 SE, color silver methalic, very good condition, grey leather interior, sunroof,am/fm cassette 
player, alarm system, new tires, second owner, please call 703-864-8728 or
703-534-2925 (703) 593-6679

Is this like  P. Adamson's (aposthrophe noted)? If so, it should be grabbed up by a knowing buyer.

Hmmmm... a couple of things could verify whether it is an SE, but the year seems wrong.  As far
as we have been able to establish the SE was only produced in 1988.  Also, the seats should be
leather with velour inserts, black with red pin-striping.  Other things to look for that point in the
right direction are the '90 GT-style wheels with different offsets, the spacers on the rear wheels,
and, of course, it must be a five speed.  If it is a genuine car that someone has converted to
LHD (they were only produced with the steering wheel on the right, sorry!) then it could well be
a good buy.  There's mine and about 148 others out there to choose from!  (And mine ain't for
sale!)
