I sometimes get strangely varying idle speeds, and sometimes the
car will die immediately (1-2 seconds) after starting.

I have *not* changed out my O2 sensor.

How much is a new one?  How hard is it to pull it out and
inspect it?  If I've been paying attention, it seems to me that
it looked like it was in the early stages of the exhaust, sticking
up out of the exhaust towards the belly pan, relatively accessible.
