S'funny, as I was typing that I thought... hmmm... I wonder when the
SP250 hit production.  I've always thought it was the first serious
British plastic production car, but Colin was certainly making things
that way in the late '50s.

The Elite, of course, was VERY special - the entire thing, chassis and
all, was tupperware.  Most aspects of it are just right, resulting in a 
car that, to me, is perfect.  Perfect, but, like the Dino 246, perfect for
other people to own.  I'll drool over them both but have no desire to
see one in my garage.
