I ignored your intentional flame-bait about "Prorsche <sic>
drivers" not being interested in safe driving or that we are so stupid
as to think that we should drive at night without gauges.

I also ignored your incorrect deduction - "Ergo, you MUST turn on your
headlights in order to see your speedo, tach... " - which was based
upon limited data.

Therefore, I will NOT spare you "I may forget to turn on my headlights
at night" since there is no indication to the contrary in numerous
cars.

DRL's DO cause people to forget to turn on their headlights, but in
many cases not because they are stupid, insane, criminal, or in any
other state of mind indicating malicious intent - contrary to what
your post seems to indicate.

And that's the end of this thread since it is not 928 related. If you
must continue then please do so via direct email.
