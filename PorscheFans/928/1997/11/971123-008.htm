Hello Ed,
Hope all is well with you.
Yes, I believe I've got the SCCA classifications cleared up now, thank you.

FYI......Just something I thought you may want to know, although you may
already. 
I went out today and checked the brakes with the 55 bar brake force regulator
again today, but this time I removed the ABS relay for some tests.
Here are the results I got:  
Level ground + straight line stopping = front brakes lock up only
Downhill + straight line stopping = front brakes lock up only
Level ground + turning fast corner = inside front brake brake locked up only 

To have gotten the rears to lock in any of these scenerios would have
required more serious front tire smoke and I did not want to flat spot the
tires. 
Just thought it was interesting to note that even with the 55 bar unit, the
fronts still do considerably more work than the rears, (which we already
knew) but doesn't seem to be a safety issue, even without ABS. 
Next step........ 65 bar.......... then....... jerk it out.   :)
Seriously though, I'm happy with it as it is and am not going any further.
Best Regards,
Greg Schickel
