Sad to say, my 928 has had an extended stay at the Dealer.
Thanks for your insight into my reported fluttering noise in the 
central vent. It was not the fan motor bearings. The bad news is 
that the problem turned out to be a vent bellows and various 
diaphragms and required many calls to the tech hotline in 
Reno and necessitated the dash to be removed. The good news is 
that the dealer quoted me $270 (for the vent(??) according to 
his troubling shooting algorithim) and will honor this amount ( 
instead of 9+ hours labor and additional parts). Fortunately, 
this stay is nearing an end.

Going through  this withdrawal period has given me insight into 
why I drive a 928. In the interim, I have been driving an 
American car ( rental, dealer courtesy), that while "fast," 
clearly is not my 928. 

The bottom line:

The 928's mystique is not about how fast a car can go, but about 
how a car can go fast.
