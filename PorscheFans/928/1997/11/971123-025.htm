(I hope I got the question marks right)
My story is a serendipitous one. Our 83 928 belonged to my wife's boss.
She loved it from the moment she saw it. I was indifferent towards it
til we got it for her and I drove it. What a car! We have now replaced 
the 83 with an 89 and it is even better.

I've been fortunate to have owned 3 cars that I totally loved.
1. A 72 BMW 2002 that used to be my dad's and was given to me 
   when I finished college.
2. a 90 Miata which we still have and is a ton of fun.
3. The 89 928. (The 83 was the appetizer and wallet shredder).

These are cars that, for me, go well beyond the sum of their design,
engineering and implementation to become magical things. When
I get in the 928 I think of taking really long drives and then 
it astounds me when we get on some real narrow twisty bits. 
Plus, the 928 is the only car I've driven that has an actual warp drive! 
cheers,
Jim
