Must be an ockker - not sure if his car is a 928 or not. :^)

Big Ears used to do Noddy's oil changes. Something about having the right
sized dipstick. :^)

Also the '83 Euro engine has a single distributor. The '85 Euro has twin
dizzies.

There's a model chronology at http://addicted.to/928 which may have more
info for you.

Don't even _think_ about it. Too much hassle.

Auto 928's are like bums - everyone's got one. If you don't like the manual
shift, sell the car to someone who does, and pick up an auto version
elsewhere.

Enjoy!
