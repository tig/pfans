Hello


I just returned with my 86 928s from Asheville, NC -- Home of
the Blue Ridge Parkway.  If they ever was a reason to drive a
928, that, my friends is it. Beautiful vistas, exhilarating
switchbacks and little traffic. I cannot recommend the
experience enough. This car and that road were meant to be
together. In this setting, my 5 spd really excels. I cannot
imagine the auto transmission for this kind of driving ( despite
what Bruce Anderson says in his article). No need for pure
speed, just incredible views, interesting terrain and
challenging curves. I whole-heartedly recommend it *<;)

Yet no good thing is unblemished. While in the mountains, my
driver's side power window became erratic and now defunct. The
local dealer changed the window switch and nothing. Now am I
faced with replacing the motor ( or is there another
possibility?). Anyone have experience doing this change? Any
instructions would be appreciated.


Secondly,  I have noticed a fluttering noise from the central
ventilation console at idle and slow speeds. It goes away
( or decreases) when I increase speed ( but not revving in
neutral). This noise is intermittent but is particularly
annoying and I am at my wits end.

In addition, does anyone know the size ( or part no.) for the
retaining washer in the on/off switch for rear air? My switch
keeps receding into the console despite my repeated repairs. I
guess I should try something that works this time.

Lastly, the light in my clock ( digital 24 hr) has gone out.
Does anyone know how to change it as opposed to replacing the
clock itself.



Once again, thanks for any help.
