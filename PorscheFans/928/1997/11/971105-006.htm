please let me pause on this occasion to express how freaking great the
aforementioned story is (in my opinion).  These are exactly the kind I
love! My rooomate is an aggressive driver and as always had big 6 BMW's.
 In college he was smart enough to be raising hell in the rain and slide
into a police van that "came out of nowhere" and was even smarter to be
driving without insurace (very broke in those days but damn if he didn't
have a BMW).  Miracle upon miracle, the police didn't show up for court
and all the tickets were dropped, didn't pay for damages, NOTHING. 
Driving without insurance is about as serious as a DUI in Georgia...

Please list your crazy driving stories...
