Stick or auto? What options?

Don't be.

My S4 is the preferred touring car in this household (taking over from a
very competent big sedan), partly because it's fun under almost any
circumstances, partly because it's really comfortable over many hours, and
partly because it doesn't break.

Before I bought mine, I canvassed all the repair shops, the owners, the
factory reps, and PCA people I could find and heard unanimously that these
are exceptionally reliable cars and have no real weak spots. Experience has
borne this out. I use this car all year and always get where I'm going.

Don't take things out of context. A lot of the traffic on this list
concerns repair or maintenance questions. 928s, like NSXs, Cadillac
Sevilles, or most other modern cars, are complex machines and need either
the full shop manual or direct prior experience for many procedures.

A lot of people who do their own work use this list as a "soft
encyclopedia", something which would probably better be served by a
fleshed-out FAQ of the sort the NSX people have put together
(http://www.public.usit.net/leng/nsxfaq00.htm) to deal with the problems of
and issues with that car.

Meanwhile, how about all the 928 list traffic exulting in tremendous,
exciting performance or long, enjoyable road trips at high average speed
and zero incidents?

>Can i feel comfortable with the 928s' reliability?

Yes. As with any other car, regular preventive maintenance is needed to get
best results.

>How much can i expect to spend on Maintenance annually?

Depends on the car's mileage and condition, on how much work you do
yourself, and how much you use the car.

>I have saved for three years to purchase an S4, and would hate to diviate
>from my plan.  Can someone convince me to buy the porsche

I'm trying, but I won't attempt to compel. If your concern about
reliability is set aside, what else influences your decision? If the issue
is having just enough to buy a car with nothing left to maintain or repair
it, no car without a comprehensive warranty is safe.
