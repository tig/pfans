Wow! Making a reasonable guess at the cow's drag coefficient and frontal
area, I estimate that this feat would require about 35 bhp, far outside
bovine norms.

Depends. Upgrade them to racing udders, strap rollerblades to their hooves,
feed 'em loads of biomass, and light the ensuing farts. They obtain quite a
high velocity.

I'm heading over to the neighbour's cattle paddock with a stopwatch.  PS. Did
I get the apostrophe right this time?

Seems the apostrophes are not nearly as important as the alignment of the
colons.  A minor detail...  would also improve the situation.    ==:-)     dr

Gentlemen, please!  It seems that we are all ignoring several key
calculational variables here.  First, has the cow been "chipped"?  Second,
how much does the cow's rolling radius change at speed?  Third, how does one
calculate the venturi effects of the infinitely variable (rpm dependent, I
think) bovine sphincter on afterburner?  Fourth, does ethanol change the
fuel-air ratio?  Fifth, will a sufficiently powerful radar detector emit
enough microwave energy to affect the pre-cooked weight?   Sixth, if, when
travelling over the car's roof, a cow spins clockwise north of the equator,
does it spin counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere?  Finally, seventh,
if a cow has four stomachs, shouldn't this discussion be on the 356, 924/944
or 914 lists?

Application of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principal would lead us to question
direct audio observation of the cow's trajectory, as Doppler effects would
change the expected "Moooo?" to "Moo-waah-Moo-ooo-wah..."  (Best observed
with sunroof open.)

Caveats:  Undercooking -- sometimes known as "ever so slightly enhanced"  --
could lead to e coli poisioning, a common ailment in Bosch injection that
leads to unintended accelleration.   Don't use your regular supply of
tire-changing rubber gloves for these tests.  You'll want the special
elbow-length versions.  Watch where you step.   ~~:^-o>
