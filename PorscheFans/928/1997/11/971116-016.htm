Yup, one bulb does the whole thing. What you DO NOT do is start by 
pulling the sliding knobs off. You have to yank the entire control unit 
(not that hard). Its been a number of years since I had mine off so I 
don't remember if you can replace the bulb from the side with only a 
center console cover removed.

To remove the control unit, start by taking the trim off which 
surrounds it and the radio. There are 4 screws hidden under that trim. 
There are one or two wire harnesses to unplug from the back, and 
another near the front for the fan switch.

Fiber optic cables conduct light from this one bulb to the centers of 
the sliding knobs. You can buy new sliding knobs if yours have been 
mangled by somebody pulling them off, but you can not buy the fiber 
optic cable if some idiot PO lost it or threw it away (as in my case). 
I was able to fabricate a satisfactory solution but I'm afraid I used 
too large of fiber optic cable and my knobs are too bright.

In short, you replace the bulb from the rear. You can not get to it by 
attempting to follow the light to its source. The bulb illuminates the 
HVAC panel from about 3" away.

Anyway, once you get that little light bulb out you can buy new at any 
good auto parts store. I think its the same bulb used for idiot lights 
and night lighting on the dash.
