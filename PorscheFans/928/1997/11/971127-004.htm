Dealer servicing makes a lot of sense for certain items.  If the independent
shop you go to isn't thoroughly familiar with 928s (they'd better have the
shop manuals!), better try the dealer.

Even the dealers don't necessarily know what they are doing since they seldom
see 928s.  They can screw things up also, but you still have a better chance
of them geeting it right.  Case in point, one local dealer tried (in vain) to
fix my inoperative cruise control.  They replaced the electronic controller 3
times (with used ones), and said that they were all bad (can't get a new one
from the factory, they are out of production, they said).  Not believing that
it is possible to have 3 defective parts in a row, I brought my car to
another dealer....they fixed the problem in 45 minutes.  It was a defective
vacuum hose, but hard to find the leak.

Best advice?  If you (or your service shop) don't have shop manuals, get them
and bring them to your service guy when you need work done.  They are worth
every penny....you'll save way more in time and fewer damaged/broken parts
(like interior trim items).
