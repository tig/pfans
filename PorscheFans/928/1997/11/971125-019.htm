Custom dyno chasis programming does make the most sense,
but there are no facilities up here.
The local shop says that the supplier will bring in the generic chips,
and if I'm not happy with them, I can send them back no charge.
I've been told they will perk up the low-mid rpm response.
I plan on trying them out next spring.  It's just too dangerous right
now. With all the extra hp, what if the ice studs come flying out
of the snow tires? I don't even want to consider what could
happen when the chains are on.
