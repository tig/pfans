The Steel panels are Hot-dip galvanized.  This deposites a layer of Zinc over
the top of the steel.  Zinc, like aluminium, doesn't rust.  The coating can
be worn away by scratching, sanding, etc.  Thus we may also be concerned over
the reactions between zinc and Al.  The term Galvanizing comes from L.
Galvani, an Italian Physiologist who died in 1798.  He used DC electricity
for medical purposes.

Thank you, Andy.  I assumed there was a "Galvan" or somebody in there
someplace.  You may be able to offer more answers about:

1) Is the steel, as used by Porsche, hot-dipped galvanized before (as flat
sheet steel) or after forming?  If before, what degradation of the zinc layer
occurs in the forming process?

2) What forced are necessary to cause sufficient degradation of the zinc
layer to constitute a failure mode (allowing the steel under the zinc layer
to rust)?  Will "bare metal sanding" for concours-quality paint prep do this?
 Will steam-cleaning do this (a serious consideration for any cars driven on
salted winter roads... or salted peanuts :^-\-})?

3) Is there a galvanic reaction between, A} Zinc and Steel, and B} Zinc and
Aluminium?

Any other metallurgists out there care to chime in?  This method of
rustproofing constitutes, to my mind, one of the greatest reasons for
avoiding earlier classics as regular drivers.  The manufacturers' long
warranties (seven-ten years against rust-through in many cases) displays
their confidence, but... (see below).
