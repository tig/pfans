Tilt! The 928 engine is not ready for such speeds, even if you fix the
crank oiling problem, because the cams don't work to provide torque much
above 6000 rpm. I'm very interested in getting the engine to spin much
faster than that (alhtough I don't know that sideloads on crank bearings,
which go up with the square of speed, will be tolerable much above 7000-7500.

Autosport has some tricks in mind, mostly having to do with radical cam
profiles (NOT high lift or high overlap, but long duration with some other
wrinkles), to permit making real torque up to such speeds. If mid-range
torque levels can be maintained up to such speeds, peak horsepower will go
up in proportion to the highest high-torque speed.

This approach will also provide higher speeds in each gear, or permit
further gearing down while maintaining top speeds in gear.

Fine. Where do you intend to do this?

Yep (see above).

A lot. Most of the power requirement comes from aerodynamic drag, which is
why Porsche worked so hard to clean up the S4. A rough calculation
(http://devserve.cebaf.gov/~bowling/aero.html) indicates that around 700
bhp will be needed to make that speed. I think this will need pulling all
the stops (enlarge the engine, get it turning faster with high torque, and
force the induction).

>I assume braking must be augmented, along with traction.

Good idea.

>So larger tires in front, and rear, meaning wider fenders to accept them.

That's what I'd do, even though wider tires increase aero drag (more
frontal area) and rolling resistance, which is why German muscle cars tend
to come with relatively narrow tires, so they'll make max speed on the
Autobahn. If you're willing to do serious bodywork, I'd go to the Viper GTS
setup of 275/40x17f, 335/35x17r, or to a similar 18" arrangement (though
the latter would probably make the ride too damn harsh).

>Are the GTS brakes sufficient, or should aftermarket Brembo systems

GTS brakes are VERY strong, but kinetic energy goes up with the square of
the speed, so the brakes in the 223 mph car would have to dissipate
(223/171)^2 = 1.7 times the energy of a stock GTS coming down from top
speed. 993 TT "Big Red" calipers and rotors from any of several
racing-oriented sources.

Right on! I admit to some interest in that direction, although I incline to
visual understatement, so my car will probably stay black, just with wider
fenders.

Yes. Marc Thomas of Devek has pushed his stock-exterior S4 into the high
190s without difficulty.

Not so. The earlier 928s had relatively high drag, but the S4's drag
coefficient is 0.34, quite low.
