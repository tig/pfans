Stephane,

No complaints about Vertex here.  In the 20,000 dollars plus worth of
restoration on my 1982 928S, Vertex supplied parts accounted for about 80-90%
of the total amount.  Also had air conditioning work done by Vertex at the
shop in Miami, service was excellent, they found the problem in about 6
hours, when no one else could for months.  Both Gilbert in Service and Oscar
in parts are extremely knowledgable about Porsche cars.  Also had parts in
which there was a core charge and didn't have any problems.  Glad to hear
that you are still a loyal customer, I think that they are great guys!  Just
my .928 Cents.
