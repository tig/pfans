Leonard, you write.....

>It works like this:

>- Your engine is limited to about 6500 rpm (assuming it has power to turn
>that fast in top gear).

>- In top gear, the total speed reduction from crankshaft to axle is your
>final drive ratio (because there is no overdrive in the transmission), here
>2.72:1. This means that the axle spins no faster than 6500/2.72 = 2390 rpm.

>- Your rear tires turn about 840 revolutions per mile traveled (most
>Porsche sizes fall within the 835-850 range; also, tires can "grow" a
>little at extreme speeds). At an axle speed of 2390 revolutions per minute,
>this means the tires are moving the car 2390/840 = 2.845 miles per minute.
>Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this makes the calculated top speed
>2.845 x 60 = 171 miles per hour.

>I'll leave it to you to decide how limiting that is.


I saw 160 mph in mine last year in the desert near Seligman, Arizona on Route
66.
Clicked picture of Speedo and Tach. Tach reads 4550 rpm at 160 mph.
Speedo seems accurate according to police radar. :)   (At least at 82 mph)
I have a 2.20 Final Drive Ratio, so plugging my numbers (rpm) in,  I
get........... 

4550 / 2.20 = 2068 rpm (axle)
2068 / 840 = 2.462 miles per minute 
2.462 x 60 = 148 mph ..................................?  

Leonard,  where you think the 12 mph discrepancy might be?
Where does the speedometer get it's reading? (can't find in manuals)
Tire size variations?  (The tires on the rear then were noticeably taller)  
Speedo error?....  Tach error?....  Leonard error?  :) ....  Punctuation
error? :)  
Incidentally, I don't believe my car could pull much, if any, over 5000 rpm
in 5th gear. Or at least it'd take a helluva long straight stretch to see it.
Down on power?

Oh, also, on 11-6-97, I posted a few questions regarding SCCA
classifications, and never got any response. It seems like I saw Kim Crumbs
car in an ad with a BSP classification on it, but I'm still not exactly clear
on the classifications with certain modifications. 
Kurt Gibble....Ed Ruiz.... perhaps you have some answers?   
Thanks,
Regards to all,
