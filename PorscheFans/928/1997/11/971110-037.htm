<<As someone that cares, I think you need to get your "need for speed" at a
track. I certainly get a thrill when traveling at the speeds a 928 was
designed to do. However, the Interstate is also used by lesser cars and
drivers. High speed travel on public roads creates a potential hazard for
you all those in your way. As much of a thrill that speeding may be, as a
driver you must also consider the potential risk you are to the public.

However, on the track you can indulge your "need for speed" in relative
saftey without placing unsuspecting commuters at risk. Since you live in
Williamsburg VA, you are only a few hours from several good tracks. I'm sure
your PCA region utilizes one or more of them for driver's ed throughout the
year. Also, my region "Potomac" uses Summit Point, WV five times a year. You
and all other PCA members are invited to participate in our well run,
educational, safe, and loads of fun events.

I would rather have you in attendance at the next "Frenzy" than read about
or see some "hot shot" in a 928 in amazing car chases on "Cops".>>

Those statements assume a lot of things that weren't present in those
situations.  I have consistently driven everything I have ever owned, at one
time or another, at the limits.  Not always.  But at least some times.  I
have done it on the track infrequently, and don't intend to do it on the
track more frequently at this time. 

I will continue to take advantage of those opportunities that present
themselves when I am driving the public highways:  when much of the traffic
around you is moving faster than you are in general and you can sustain high
average speeds on a long trip and cut many minutes from the trip (as it was
on the way back from Baltimore this Sunday, as anybody who lives in the area,
like you Ed, would know) (remember when you were in williamsburg and you told
us you made it in something like 2 hours, or the equivalent of about 80
average speed?), when the highway opens up in a long downhill straight with
no traffic in front of you at all, and you have just been through that
portion of the highway minutes before when lost and heading in the wrong
direction (as it was when I hit 155 in the Baltimore suburbs), when you are
cruising along on the highway and a "knot" of traffic has a wide open road in
front of it before the next "knot" (as it did on the ride down I-95 on
several occasions this weekend that allowed brief flirtations with the 130's
and 140's).  

By telling me the obvious, that other cars and drivers may not be able to
cope with those speeds and situations, you are telling me that I must be
stupid (since I would never have considered that it wasn't "safe" for the
other drivers and cars) to do what I describe.  But instead, it is quite the
opposite.  The only thing stupid about it is the risk of getting a speeding
ticket.  (which is stupid enough to obviate the need for this long message
alone) As I pointed out above there are many times and places that are
available to speed relatively safely if you want to risk the fines.  I could
set the cruise on 120 for the entire trip from Baltimore to Williamsburg and
never have to slow down once if there wasn't any traffic.  The road is not a
limiting factor, my skill is not a limiting factor, the performance
capability of the car is not a limiting factor.  

There was never any mention of any car chase, or weaving in and out of
traffic, or nearly missing a curve, or etc.  I have beaten police before.
 Exactly three times.  In a BMW 635, 533, and on the motorcycle.  All were
well after midnight, and there were virtually no other cars on the road.  I
wouldn't have chanced it if there was any other traffic to consider.  I
wouldn't even count the thing in Tennessee as beating a cop.  He merely did
an obvious u turn, and I had the good fortune of an open road and a
convenient turn out.  He never had a chance, unless he had merely glanced to
the side either of the times he drove past.  And if the road hadn't been open
in front of me I never would have accelerated away from a u turning trooper
in the first place.  

I appreciate the concern.  I honestly do.  But safety advice when you are
uninhibited by the facts can be misplaced.  Instead you might assume that the
situation allowed me to safely do what I wanted to do.  On the other hand you
may believe that it is never safe to break the speed limit on a public
highway.  

It is a simple fact of life that when I am on the road in my car, or on my
bike, or in some other car, I occasionally speed.  Sometimes the road allows
a lot more speed than other times.

Let's be carefull out there.  But let's not sit in the left lane at 55 all
the time either.
