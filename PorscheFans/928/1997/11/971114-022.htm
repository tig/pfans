You've quoted me out of context. Greg Schickel has not changed his final
drive ratio, but has changed his rear tire size.

Also, you're also departing from my original context by talking about the
ACTUAL road speed. My comment, as you quoted it, refers explicitly to the
INDICATED road speed, which has a fixed relation to the indicated engine
speed for a given gear ratio and final drive ratio, since both instruments
are driven from parts of the drivetrain (flywheel for the tach, final drive
for the speedo). Greg's question had to do with observing a relation
between the two indications which was not consistent with those ratios.
