Just to make sure that there is no misunderstanding...

The rear wheels do NOT perform the major portion of slowing down a car during
stops.  As the stop increases in severity, weight transfer from rear to front
increases as well, which means that the maximum force to which the front
tires can be subjected prior to lockup also increases.  Conversely, since
weight is transferred rear to front, the amount of stopping force that can be
applied to the pavement using the rear tires decreases.  In theory, it is
possible to have 100% of the vehicle's braking force applied through the
front tires while the rear tires provide none (given sufficient weight
transfer due to rapid deceleration).  In this case, you'd like to apply
virtually NO braking to the rears, with most of the braking force applied to
the fronts.  This is why car manufacturers for a long time used discs in the
front and drums in the rear...because the work in stopping a car is mostly
carried out by the front brakes and therefore brake fade at the rear was not
a problem needing to be solved by the use of disc brakes.

While not so obvious with cars, check out high performance motorcycles.
 Bikes carry TWO large diameter discs and 4 (or even 6) piston calipers up
front, while the rear is equipped with a single disc of considerably smaller
diameter with sometimes only a 2-piston caliper.  Even though the rear tire
may have twice the foot print of the front tire, it provides virtually no
braking when decelerating hard coming into a slow corner.  This extreme
weight transfer is due to the short wheelbase of the bike and its very high
(compared to a car) center of gravity.  Just before coming to a complete
stop, a good rider on a good bike can perform a so called "stopie" where the
rear wheel lifts off the ground completely.  One of the ongoing problems in
teaching new riders (and a lot of older ones), is convincing them that in an
emergency situation, the FRONT brake may save you from hitting some
unpleasant object, whle relying on the rear brake will either put you on the
ground due to lockup or put you into the unpleasant object at a
none-too-pleasant speed.

The use of front/rear braking pressure proportioning valves to reduce the
amount of hydraulic pressure applied to the rear with respect to the front as
total braking pressure increase is a crude form of ABS...trying to prevent
the operator from locking the rears and spinning the car in emergency stops
by reducing the rear braking force.
Obviously ABS does a perfect job of proportioning total braking pressure so
that the clod at the wheel doesn't lock up his rears.

Remember....the FRONT brakes do the work, ABS allows the rears help out as
much as they can without locking up.  I hope no one perpetuates this
dangerous myth of the rear brakes doing the work during hard stops.  It just
isn't true.
