Clearly, yes.

Yep.

Maybe, but proceed with care (see below).

Probably not; see below.

OK; how can this happen? Either you're trying to brake at all four wheels,
but the rears have locked up and thus broken loose, or braking has failed
(or been switched off) at the rear.

Until you ask for more than rear wheel traction can provide, at which point
the rear wheels break loose, producing the metastable
spin-waiting-to-happen condition. Car makers went from rear-wheel brakes
(often effectuated by a single brake assembly working on the driveshaft) to
four wheel brakes about 70 years ago, when it became clear that you could
get more powerful braking by exploiting the traction of all four tires.

As long as you don't break the rear tires loose.

Again, as long as you don't break the rear tires loose. If you do, you'll
have a whole new problem to control.

>Try it some time this winter and you'll gain some new repect for that lever.

I advise maintaining suitable respect all year.
