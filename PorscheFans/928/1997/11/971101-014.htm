Tee hee...judging by his reaction (an extension of his middle finger, an
insult here in the States), he was chagrin'd.

My appreciation of the 928 is there.  I wouldn't belong to the list

new Cobra will beat a 928 anytime.

Now, if we were talking about high speeds for extended periods of time, I'd
be wishing I had a 928 right now.
