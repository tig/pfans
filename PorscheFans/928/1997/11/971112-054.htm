I would ask PCNA about that.  However, regardless of the answer, if it
were MY car, I would do the replacement as just cheap insurance - well,
not cheap ... just insurance.  You know that the pump or belt will
choose to let go on you at the most inconvenient time.  And, oh,
consider the indignity of being seen in public with your glorious 928
being loaded on a flatbed whilst leaking its vital bodily fluids...<G>.

I don't think you really need the 9-vol set.  I wouldn't have purchased
mine except I couldn't find a 4-vol set.  The only advantage would be if
you felt you really needed the updates - not really very many or planned
on getting another, later 928 and keeping both.  As far as I know, the
1981 is identical to the 1982 in every respect.  1983, introduced the
4.7L engine.  BTW, the additional 5 vols. in the 9 vol set cover such
esoteric items as ABS, airbags, dual A/C, 32-valve engine, the newer
5-speed trans, the newer 4-speed automatic etc.  All this is stuff you
don't have on your car.
