Hi 928 Fans:

I have really enjoyed reading all your comments and suggestions over the
past couple of months and now I am going to ask for some of the expert
advise out there myself.  

When I bought my car, my idle control valve was seized.  Upon removal, I
noticed it was rusted shut and was allowing the electrical contact to
burn indents into the contacts.  I have rotated the valve to a stuck
position that allows it to idle great when warmed up, although it needs
a little "feathering" when first starting up at below 40 degrees.  I
guess my question is: Does having this valve set in one position effect
anything else in the performance?  I am currently looking for a
replacement part.  (Idle Stabilizer Valve P/N 928-606-161-00 (this P/N
for 85/86 only)).  Does anybody out there have a spare or know where I
can get one at a reasonable price?

A couple of other items.  My "!" light comes on when the
marker/headlights are turned on.  Warning light in "Tach" lights up with
taillight.  When I hit the "!" button it clears off , but the taillight
warning light stays on.  I have replaced all the bulbs and cleaned all
contacts on rear, license, side and front but no change.  Any ideas?
("!" comes on with lights being turned on from stand still or moving
position)

I was told that in Ohio, collector license plates exempt you from
emission testing.  Fact or Fiction, does anyone know?

Thanks in advance for all your help.
