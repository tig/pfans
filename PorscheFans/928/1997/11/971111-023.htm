I know how you feel, Paul!  When I was moving from India-no-place to
Tucson-- a clear, dry  Sunday morning (10am) in January 1995, westbound
on I-70 in Kansas, driving alone in a plain Mercury Tracer with Indiana
plates, I was stopped using instant-on radar (clocked at 73 in a 65
zone).  OK, so I get a ticket after six years with clean record, no big
deal.  The cop then announced that "Sir, this is a major drug trafficing
corridor, so I would like to search your car." 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unfortunately, the police tactic described by Rob is still alive and
well.  In Kansas, fitting the drug-courier profile (solo male driving a
nondescript (especially rented!) out-of-state car), along with probable
cause (going one MPH over the posted speed limit), is sufficient grounds
for a drug search.  I read about this in the press a year or so ago.

This is a win-win situation for them.  If they find a "recordable"
amount of illegal drug(s), they confiscate your car for resale at
auction and slap you with a huge fine.  They don't want you sucking up
money in the local jail for "minor" amounts of drugs - they just want
the money.  If they find more than whatever the trigger amount is, they
turn you over to the feds as a courier and still don't have to pay for
your incarceration. Even if they don't find any drugs, they issue the
speeding citation, thus stuffing the local coffers.  (Since you are
out-of-state, you are almost always going to mail in the amount demanded
rather than fight the charge in court.)

At least a couple of counties and several municipalities are in on the
shake-down.  Even the state highway patrol gets in on the act by
dispatching roving "wolf packs" armed with "no tolerance" orders. This
blatant trampling of your rights is being tolerated by the judiciary as
long as you fit the profile and the cop has probable cause (i.e., you
were speeding).

I think it is safe to say that more states/counties/municipalities will
adopt similar tactics in the face of a declining local tax base coupled
with shrinking federal largess.  While the amount of the fine may appear
not worth going back to fight the charge, the odds are probably on your
side. (1) The officer may not even show up, having assumed you will mail
in the fine. (2) The judge may reduce/throw out the charge if you show
up in a suit, act respectful, and plead that you were just driving with
the traffic while enjoying the magnificent wheat fields... (3) While the
$125 fine is no big thing, the collateral damage to your insurability
warrants putting out any effort required to lessen the effect!
