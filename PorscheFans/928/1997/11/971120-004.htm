Trust me you are doing the right thing.  All races involve a tremendous
amount of risk without the added element(s) of poor road condition or
insuitability (a real word?) to task.  This reminds me of previous
Silver State road race where the roads were so bad, Devek bent rims and
vowed not to return unless the course moved locations or was improved. 
I guess in one respect we are lucky here in the states to have a
'cazillion' miles of high speed interstates / freeways & highways.
