> I'm curious what the consensus on radar detectors is:

I'm sure you will get responses which recommend a particular brand.  I
received one as a gift last summer (Escort, I believe) and it drove me
crazy with false alarms.  I gave it back to my wife and told her to save
her money.

However, you should be aware that detectors can be a mixed blessing in
California.  Be careful not to abandon your paranoid attitude when you
have the detector on.

For years the California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers were forbidden to
use radar.  It still is used only in limitted areas and appilicatons.
The result is that CHP officers are very skilled at (and really enjoy)
catching you "the old fashioned way".  They wait on on-ramps or in
rest-stops, draft trucks, track from frontage roads, hide in your blind
spot, etc.

In addition, several major rural highways (such as I-5 in particular)
are patrolled by aircraft.  The airplane tracks/paces you,  then radios
ahead to a patrol car (maybe one of the fast 5.0L Mustangs or Z-28
Cameros) which performs the actual stop and issues you a citation.

I was also surprised to learn that the patrol density (CHP per mile) can
be very intense on sections with high offense/accident rates.  A friend
(soon to be retired CHP) told me his AM "beat" was a section of HW24
only about four miles long.  All he does for three hours every morning
is drive up and down that short section.  It'd be pretty hard for him to
miss you if you were misbehaving.
