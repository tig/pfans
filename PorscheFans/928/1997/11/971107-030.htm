Good, you're getting closer. As John White just pointed out, once the rears
lock, particularly if the fronts are still braking, the rear will come
around. Even if the fronts are not braking, but have traction (the case in
all the slow-down-with-the-handbrake stories), breaking loose the rears
makes a metastable situation, in which any twitch at the front will let the
rear, which is feeling free to continue straight ahead at full speed,
"pass" the front.

The maneuver often called a "bootlegger's turn", which has its roots in
evading the revenooers, consists of yanking the handbrake to break loose
the rear tires while flicking the steering wheel a little in the direction
of the desired turn. As the rear comes around, you come off the gas to
re-establish traction when the car has spun 180 degrees, then get back on
and go.

It's very easy to screw this up, resulting in uncontrolled rotation per
some of the stories we've gotten recently. I expressly disclaim any
responsibility for the results of anyone's experiments with "handbrake
turns".
