Thanks (for the ever-so-sincere compliment and the hearty laugh).

I hope not. Even pre-S4 brakes should stop you a lot faster than that,
unless the road is wet, or you rely solely on the handbrake.

The stories we've been treated to suggest that an enterprising fellow with
a well-equipped car (both apply to Paul H.) should be able to beat that
number. Shall we have a "Spin of the Week" feature on this list?

45 sounds like a lot, but 1200 rpm at the axle is only about 85 mph.

>So based on the above figures, how much will the fine be?

I'd prefer to measure that by a nice dimensionless ratio P (for "pain"),
defined as follows:
		P = amount of fine/replacement cost of car

One must try to avoid values of P greater than unity.
