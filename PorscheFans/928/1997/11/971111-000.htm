Great story, I know it's not a real smart to evade the law, but it does give
me a chuckle to know luck is not always on the side of the law. It's funny
thinking about how pissed off they must have been! I love it!

>On the way back I made the same distance in 2:52. 

Man, you've been setting some blistering paces Brian! 
I wish I had an 89' as there are a few things improved on them from my model
year.
 
>I was scanning some pics from the frenzy and thought you might want to see a
pic >of your car.  Hope everything is going well with you and the car.

Brian, that's awful nice of you to do that!  Thanks.....that's a good picture
too.  
I may send it to Phil Tong to post, if that's ok?
Yes, all is well. Changed oil yesterday. Installed 55 bar brake force
regulator and bled brakes / clutch today. Test drive tommorrow!
I hope all is well with you also, and look forward to getting together again.
Regards,
Greg Schickel
