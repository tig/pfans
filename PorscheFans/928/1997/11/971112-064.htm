Hi Leonard,
I am posting this to the group so as to restore your exalted status, which
was so foolishly questioned, (but I hope not tarnished) by my "Leonard
error?" remark.  :)  

I was thinking I had a 245 x 45 tires on at the time, but I forgot that my
prevous tire choice was only available in a 245 x 50 for the rear. (Your
reply made me think to dig out my old tire receipt for an answer)   

So here goes.....new calculations.......

The diameter of a 245 x 50 tire is 25.65"
So, the circumference is 80.58"
Which makes these tires turn at 786 revolutions per mile.
Therefore........

4550 / 2.20 = 2068 rpm (axle)
2068 / 786 = 2.63 miles per minute
2.63 x 60 = 158 mph 

That's a little closer! 
(just got your second reply, Leonard) 
Thank you for checking and comparing in your car for me. 
Yes, I'll have to see what my calibration is currently, with correct tires.
I'd imagine it's ok now. Nasty weather currently prevents me as it's clean
and waxed and I'd rather wait for nice day. (Also waiting to check new 55 bar
brake force regulator and ATE Blue brake and clutch bleed job)
Still leaves question of where speedo gets it's info. I'd suspect you are
correct in the assumption that it's off the transaxle. (or maybe a pickup on
the torque tube?)
Next question.....Would the larger tire diameter's be harder for the engine
to pull rpm's on?   (Perhaps greater top end potential, but nullified by the
fact that the motor can only pull so hard) 

Ok, enough babbling......(wait....let me babble some more)  :)
Again, my apologies to Leonard and also Phillip. 
(I should know better than to get into this current punctuation war)     :)

Regards to all,
Greg Schickel
