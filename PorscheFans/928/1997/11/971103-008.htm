Well I HATE tickets. And I have a low opinion of (MOST) police officers. =
I would have to say that _MOST_ of the state troopers I have met are so =
excited about 'the quarry' that they are likely not to notice you coming =
the other way especially if you dont make eye contact/drive normally. =
You can always say 'I didnt realize I was being pursued and i forgot =
something at my last stop' etc... Of course if your car looks like Paul =
H.s yellow thing I think they'd REALLY have to be engaged in the =
pursuit...

I am a pretty smooth talker, and have talked my way out of quite a few =
tickets using these guidlines:

1. Most cops are normal people. Use respect, dont get angry, they are =
doing their job, talk to them as such.
2. If they show even SLIGHT interest in your car, tell them about it! =
Engage them in a conversation, likely they are car buffs and you can =
impress them, they wont be so interested in writing you up at that =
point.
3. Dont talk down to them! Sure you are _PROBABLY_ smarter than they are =
but you dont have to ACT like it. They will feel alot more justified in =
writing you a ticket if you are a jerk or act angry/indignant.
4. Get out of your car, shake their hand, make eye contact, introduce =
yourself to them. Dont do anything stupid like you are going to attack =
them, some state troopers dont like you getting out of your car, but if =
its a local officer or CHP/some friendlier states they will think of you =
more as a professional than a 'guy sitting behind the wheel of a smoking =
gun'

As a 16 year old kid driving a 924 I was pulled over for
1. 50 in a 35, talked my way out of it 'so I have to keep the revs up =
otherwise it starts missing etc, I really didnt think I was being =
dangerous, I guess I should pay more attention in the future' - Walked =
away w/written warning
2. 78 in a 55, 'wow officer, have you ever driven one of these? I just =
got it back from the shop and its so much smoother than my moms tercel =
that I didnt even realize! So I guess you're used to that, those Crown =
Vics ride pretty smooth dont they?'

As a 19 year old kid in a lowered Toyota Supra w/ground effects, NO CAT, =
loud exhaust, wide wheels/centerline rims, "HEY COP" red paint
1. Illegal U-Turn/Exhibition of speed (I did a high speed u-turn and =
slid my rear end out) (I got out of that one by having the officer 'help =
me' figure out my fog-light switch position. He mentioned that I =
shouldnt have them on under city driving conditions so i asked him to =
tell me when they were on so i could note which position the switch was =
in)
2. Illegal lane change/70 in a 55, (To tell you the truth i must have =
talked to that CHP officer for 15 minutes, I dont really remember about =
what, but he ended up writing me up for an equipment violation 'tint' =
etc and no mention of the speed)


Now Im not saying that I have never gotten a ticket, in my 6 years of =
pedal to the metal driving I have received two, one in my supra for 82 =
in a 65, (Jerk New Mexico state trooper picked me out of 10 other cars =
in the same group because i had out of state plates), and one where I =
was doing 90 and weaving in and out fo traffic in my camaro. I was =
honest with that cop and I said 'listen, you and I both know that I =
deserve a ticket, Im not going to argue with you, but I really am in a =
hurry otherwise i wouldnt have been going so fast' - He wrote me up for =
"72+" which really helped me in court - allowed me to erase it from my =
record in traffic school.

Sorry for the long post - hope it helps someone.
