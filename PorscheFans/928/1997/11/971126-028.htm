Vincent,

It depends on your friends car.  When I got my '88 one year ago it felt
REALLY slow...I mean slower than my V8 T-bird.  The owner said she thought
her husband had installed high performance chips but I did not believe it.  I
bought some AutoThority chips of my own.  Took the brain out and....sure
enough there were 6 year old AutoThority chips right there.  I was PISSED!

Went ahead and took the old ones out, put in the new and was relieved when
the car started.  Went out to the highway and roped on it and was VERY HAPPY!
 Talk about an awakening!  My god what a difference some good new chips can
make.  I think LL's custom chips would be the best way to go however as it is
only a few hundred more for the custom job to really get the car dialed in.

I did not really notice any improvement from the K&N or the bypass pipe
(other than the pipe sounds much better), but they are cheap to add if your
friend chooses to do so.

Hope that helps,
