<<I have a friend that has a 87 S.  He inquired about replacing the
chips in
his car & someone advised against it.  It was at a very reputable 928
supplier & they stated that the performance gains were minimal to the
point
that they said it's not worth the money.>>

I highly disagree.  I have an 87 S4 auto that I installed the
AutoThority chips in and it made a very noticeable difference. 
Driveability around town was greatly improved, as was fuel economy,
believe it or not.  The chips are rather pricey (and AutoThority is the
only one I would even consider), but they do make a difference.  Of
course my exhaust and intake work helped my car too, but a chip is a
good starting point in my opinion.

P.S.  I bought mine from EuroProducts - same chip but $200 cheaper than
from AutoThority direct.  1-800-962-0911
