928 fans,

If you have not yet taken advantage of the various PCA region track events,
do yourself a favor next year and go to one!!  They are an absolute blast,
and really the only place to wring your car out and see just how much it can
take.  You will be amazed at how capable these cars are, no matter what year
you own or drive.

Texas World Speedway (TWS) was the most recent event for those in the central
TX area and was a great Sun...Sat we won't talk about.  It rained heavily on
Sat and so it was pretty much a swim meet more than a high speed driving
school, but talk about learning car control!!  Can't beat a wet race track
for learning the ins and out's of control.

Sun is what I really want to talk about (especially since I was not there on
Sat knowing that my wheel wells would get dirty if I even drove to the track
in the rain, I stayed home ;) ).  Today was a very good time with lots of
people there to enjoy the cold winter weather for the weekend.  I did not
personally witness any incidents but a few people did do some landscaping
throughout the weekend.  I was able once again to improve my smoothness,
which is very important for speed.

I felt like I was making great strides in car control and am continuing to
learn the nuances of throttle control and really feeling the tires working on
the track.  For instance it was cold so the tires and track were not at their
best but I could really feel the car move around in turns 4 and 10 and would
use a slightly later braking and turning procedure to help the rear of the
car rotate around and turn better than you might get by getting all of the
braking done in a straight line and then turning the corner and getting on
the power.

Also worked on refining my kickdown switch engagement so that I could pick up
the gear or hold the gear more the way I wanted to have it done.  Again as an
example...coming out of the carousel (turn 7) where you have huge understeer
and then make a left onto the second fastest portion of the track last time I
was engaging the kickdown a little early and getting a huge push and
slide/drift out almost off the track which not only gets your attention but
is also not generally the fastest way around.  Today I got on the gas at the
same time but waited till I had apexed turn 8 to engage the kickdown and then
stay in the gas (not full on it however) through the dog-leg left which is
turn 9, then hard on the brakes for the left of turn 10 and then a quick
right down to 3rd, and then as you come left to make the turn onto the high
banked front straight down to 2nd (kickdown) and off you go to a top speed of
somewhere just over 130 before jumping on the brakes for the 1-2 complex.

Wow, what fun.  I always have a blast driving and visiting with all of the
wonderful PCA folks out there.  A great bunch of people and some really fun
cars, and I am happy to say that the 928 attendance has been way up over the
last half of this year.  Last Sept we had 5 drivers and this time we also had
5 drivers and more than one person commented as to how nice it was to see
such great cars (each one of them is well cared for) and to see how well they
performed.  Everyone expects the much lighter 911's to be fast around the
track and for the 928's to be fast on the straights, but they are all real
surprised to see just how well these cars rock in the turns too...of course
you all already know how good they are!!

I encourage each of you to take the time in the new year to make it out to
one of your local PCA track events and really learn how to drive the wheels
off your wonderful machine.  It will not only be an enjoyable and eye opening
experience, it will also make you a better driver on the streets that you are
on every day.

Cheers,
