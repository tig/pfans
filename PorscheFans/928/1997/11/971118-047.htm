It seems that my torque tube is on it's way out... I have an 
extremely loud, RPM-dependent howling from that area (so loud it 
sounds like Im driving a gear-driven Chevy smallblock). It's not 
causing wild vibration, just lots of -noise-.

 My question is, what's the failure mode of these things?  Does it 
just get louder & louder until any sane person would stop & fix it? 
Or are we talking catastrophic failure?  I first noticed it get a lot 
noisier a couple weeks ago after not driving it for a month..it seems 
to be holding steady now. I know 928 Int'l has rebuilt ones for 
$500-ish, but how much labor is involved? It looks like quite a job.. 
Any ballpark figures for having a shop replace it?

If it's not one thing...

Is this what happens when you put 40,000 miles on a 928 in a year? ;)
(Turns out that my intermittent starting problem was simply an old 
battery & a low idle..whew.)

Thanks,
Chris
