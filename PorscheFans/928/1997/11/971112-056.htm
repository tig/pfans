Does it instantly blow, or does it blow within a few minutes, or do you =

find out it worked until the next time you really needed it?

If its not an instant blow, pull one side of the fuse and connect an =

amp meter in series (keep the fuse for protection). Need an amp meter =

good for 30 or 50 amps, this is fairly hard to come by. However, you =

should be able to tell how much current is being pulled. A 25 amp fuse
isn't used to protect a circuit pulling 25A, more along the lines of =

15A is expected.

Any chance you are putting 2.5A fuses in the 25A fuse place? It is =

possible your box of fuses is defective and another brand 25A fuse or =

another box of fuses would solve the problem.

Never ever put a higher rated fuse in the fuse box. Rather than smoking =

the fuse you *will* smoke the wires. If its under warranty, and you are =

continually blowing fuses, and if the dealer's mechanic puts a bigger =

fuse in the fuse box, then that's the best way to smoke the wiring =

harness and total the car at the dealer/warranter's expense. Then again =

there is always the chance that once they see smoke they can find the =

problem and fix it.  :-)

Any chance your rear window has a sun screen film applied? An idiot PO =

applied a reflective film on my 928S's rear window. Later removed it. =

Now exactly one horizontal trace on my rear window actually heats.

Any suggestions for rear window defogger repair? I have exactly the =

opposite problem of Diego Yankelevich, mine won't pull enough current =

to challenge a fuse.

The human mind ordinarily operates at only ten percent of its
capacity -- the rest is overhead for the operating system.
