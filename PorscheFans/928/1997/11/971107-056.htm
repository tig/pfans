Hi Paul, All

Now when my car goes to Europe this summer, I will probably hit 150-170 on
some roads, but at that speed, another 30 mph is a very big step up, and is
insane on an Autobahn (most of which look like our clogged US freeways
these days). Now 150 is acceptable and rather common with the right road
and traffic conditions, and in the right car.

  Having lived here in Germany for the last 14 years, I'd like to add 
my input to the above. Yes it is true that many of the 'bahns are 
pretty clogged during work hours and near the major cities. Typical 
speeds here are usually in the 120-200 km/hr range. HOWEVER, this all 
depends on which state you will be driving in. In states where the 
"Greens" and their ilk are in the majority, you can expect max speed 
to be 120-130 km/hr. States include Bavaria (Munich), Hesse (Frankfurt)  and 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (Stuttgart). I'm not sure if ALL of  the 
'bahns in these states are restricted to this speed, but many are. In 
the state of Rheinland-Palatintate where I live (Kaiserslautern) MANY 
of the 'bahns are unrestricted and the traffic is usually never too
bad (except where they have road construction) to really cruise. 
   The times that I find best to really cruise are after 6PM during 
the week and early Sat and Sun. ESPECIALLY Sunday. Hit the road at 
7-8 A.M. and you will have no trouble hitting your "200" mph, with 
VERY minimal (if any) traffic. Again, this depends on the state you 
are in. The German's have a very heavy setup of radar cameras on 
stretches where the speeds are restricted. I don't know what they 
would do with your photo/ticket if they got you though, since these 
tickets are usually mailed to your address for you to pay??!! Radar 
dectectors are illegal here (the ones you have in the states work 
here though), and will be confiscated and a heavy (400 DM) imposed. 
SOoooo, I don't use one, your call though.
   My favorite (s) 'bahns are A-5 out by Frankfurt (4 lanes, smooth 
as glass and runs straight FOR miles), A-67 from Darmstadt to A-6 all the way 
to Saarbruecken (one helluva long HIGH speed cruise) or A-62 from 
Landstuhl to A-1 to Trier. This one is a FAVORITE. It has PLENTY of 
high speed sweepers that will take YOU to your limit, long straights 
dropping out of the hills into long straight valleys (easy 200 mph), 
where I've had my 91 951 hit 300 km/hr on the ever optimistic Porsche 
speed-o-meter, and picture book scenery. 
  Depending on when any of you come here, I hope that you could hook
up with our PCA-Germany Region for some event. We go to RUF's every 
year for a tour and BBQ with Alois Ruf (who's been a member of our 
region for 20 years!). Or a Photo Rally out of Porsche AG's new car 
place in Ludwigsburg ending at the Porsche museum in Stuttgart. Or 
maybe just to see/run in one of our Slalom's. Check out our website 
at:  http://platz.com/pca/germany/pcagrhm.html 
next year for our up-coming schedule as this year is about finished.
  A nice website to check out Germany and its states/cities is:
