Perhaps we could put this up for open competition - the best explanation for
being caught rotating energetically down the centre of the highway....

"I thought you hadn't noticed me and I really just needed someone to talk to..." could
have been a good start?

Greetings:

An interesting thread on ticket evasion. Thought I'd share a mishap with
the parking brake maneuver. This was performed years ago with my 84 300
ZX. In this car the parking brake works the rear discs. 

Upon detection, I immediately yanked up the parking brake and the car
slowed very quickly. However, in my zeal to aviod detection I pulled up
so hard that my hand came off the lever, the rear wheels locked and
before I could release the button I was doing pirouettes down the road. 

If you think brake lights are a give-away, try explaining this to a
Louisiana State Policeman.
