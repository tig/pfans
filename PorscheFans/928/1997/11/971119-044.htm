Okay, I know someone out there has experienced this problem and can offer
some suggestions to correction. This one is strange to me.  My left headlight
(original equipment)  doesn't work.  I have changed the bulb so I know it's
not the bulb since I checked the bulb on the right side.  I have also changed
the three prone wire plug. The light was working fine.  I also had the dealer
check it out again the light was working.  Then all of a sudden the light
doesn't work.  Sometimes the light comes on sometimes its doesn't.  Any idea
what to look for.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
