Ken:  You must be thinking of highway areas where there is some light.
I'm talking about the Cascade Mountains at midnite.  Get on a completely
dark road and try to recognize cars oncoming cars, particularly when you
come upon them abruptly, and try to identify them.  Its pretty hard.
Your reasoning is exactly why I didn't try it, though, 'cause i was
driving the SVX, the strange car of the decade, with just too many
distinctive design features that possibly could be noticed.   As far as
evading an officer; I don't think so.  He doesn't have his flashers or
siren on when you make the U so if he is able to prove that you made the
U it could be for any reason you want to suggest.  Once the red lights
go on, you're correct.
