Well, most of yesterday and Saturday's snow has washed away, and my shark is
thinking of going outside after the sun has been out for a few days.  (That
is IF the sun ever shines again here down Maine.

I was re-reading the current Excellence article about the new 996.  I had
thought that I might actually be interested in one sometime down the road.
You see, I really would like to have a "winter" Porsche, and the Carrera 4
with winter tires sounds good for those many "not too Noreaster" days that
we get up here.  I thought that a 996 in about five years might be the
replacement for the shark.

After reading the article, I realize that the 996 will not replace the 928
for me simply because all the things that the 928 does so well, especially
long distance travel, the 996 doesn't do all that well....at least in two
wheel drive form.

Oh, I am sure that it is quieter inside, and comfy and all of that.  But
where it breaks down is in the long distance part of "long distance
touring".  I mean, a FOURTEEN GALLON fuel tank?  

Anyway, it all made me think about why Porsche brought out the 928,
ostensibly as the 911 replacement.  I wonder if the 928 was merely an error
on the part of the then weak Porsche marketing people.  Perhaps they thought
that here, in their biggest market, the touring characteristics of the 928
would prove more popular than the 911 type of performance, given the aging
of the buyer with the money to buy their cars.  If the 928 had proven more
popular, then the 911 would have gone away, and I have no idea what we would
have from Porsche today.  Maybe Porsche would have gone away for all of that.

Anyway, perhaps my garage should plan on my 928 and then later on, maybe a
964 Carrera 4 for winter?  Then of course, later on, perhaps I can find a
really nice GTS to replace the S4?

Oh, enough of this fantasizing...gotta go to work!
