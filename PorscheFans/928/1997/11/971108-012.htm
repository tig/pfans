Hey all!

re: Bruce's article on 928 market values

The prices don't look too far off from the 'real world'.  I think the
important thing to note while shopping is discerning the true condition
of the car and to let that guide you as to price.  It will never be an
exact science!

The article also leaves out pricing for the 928 GT, no doubt due in part
to the reason given for the Slantnose 930S Cabriolet on page 106,
"...because it is such a rare and specialized car, making it difficult
to establish a market value..."

No offense BEB, but I would never sell "Big Blue" for 20's hi or low! 
My investment (and even Lucky although he doesn't own the car anymore!)
is way past that at this point but anyways this car is now priceless to
me and I could never part with it.  (Well, unless you waived a 6-liter
or GT-based Spyder this way :)

I couldn't begin to let you all know the special feeling I get whenever
I pass by the photo shoot parking lot, or pull into Devek's driveway - I
might not remember everyone's name that was there that day, but
definately remember all the smiling faces, all the landsharks 'nesting',
then all of us saddling up and sharking about the roads!

All of that and more is wrapped up into this neat package I call Big
Blue.

I hope all 928s will eventually find their owners and vice versa!
Phil Tong
ps.  Moira - hang in there and keep looking - *your* landshark is out
there in that big ocean!
