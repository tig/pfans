Ok, I'll bleed again in the next day or so, to be sure, this time pumping the
pedal with the bleeder open while pressurized.

Right under the front left fender towards the front. (near power steering
reservoir) 
(cylindrical shape, about the diameter of a quarter, and about 2" long)

Possibly because of too much rear brake, but only if the things you mentioned
previously are the root cause (rotors, pads, cooling). 
I mean, too much rear brake could cause squirmyness, but it's definitely not
from being too rear brake biased. The 928 is way too front brake biased for
that to be the cause in and of itself. 
Perhaps, because they can't dissipate the heat as well, the thinning rotors
are growing, causing the rears to grab.  
   
> Nah, I'm just thinking Weissach axle toe dependence on longitudinal forces.

The Weissach rear end is designed to give toe-in to counteract the "tuck-in"
effect accompanied by load changes such as lifting off the gas or braking,
especially if done in mid-corner. These load changes cause an alteration of
the toe-in, caused by "soft" suspension bushings. This causes the loaded
outside wheel to toe-out, and creates rear oversteer, which is undesirable.
The Weissach axle causes a toe-in instead.
But, the speed of the Weissach correction is critical, (See Project 928 Book)
because, the "toe-in change does indeed influence the tuck-in behavior, but
only when it takes place immediately". Remember when we talked about the
suspension bushings at the "Frenzy"?  Well.....soft bushings are too "slow"
and Porsche engineering had to experiment to find the "highest practical
rigidity of rubber bushings" for the Weissach effect to work quickly enough. 
If your squirming is suspension related, it may be due to bushing
degradation, but I don't think stiffer springs enter into the equation.      
Also, since trail braking is not a sudden input, (the SUDDEN input was when
you SLAMMED on the brakes BEFORE the turn)  :)  I'm not sure if the Weissach
axle is doing it's toe-in "thing" as feverishly as it would be at the onset
of a "load change".
I mean, even though the Weissach axle is still doing it's thing, and the high
lateral acceleration values are being cotrolled by it, the initial toe-in
correction had already been made, and unless you make another sudden mid-turn
correction, should remain fairly constant. 
(Remember the whole Weissach axle design came about because Porsche wanted to
make a car that was to transcend mere mortal cars, and also cure the problems
associated with the infamous 911 and it's severe lift throttle oversteer
tendancies)  
Sorry, I'm rambling again, but I thought I'd share with the group my
understanding of the Weissach Axle, since it has been a topic of late.
Input, comments, and criticism welcome. (although the later, less so)   :)

Regards,
Greg Schickel
