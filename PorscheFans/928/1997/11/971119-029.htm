Caliper location is most probably more important if you are ducting air for
rotor cooling.  Looks like the front chin spoiler does that on my car.
Having the caliper at the rear of the assembly means that the incoming air
cools the rotor itself before it does anything for the caliper.  This is
merely speculation on my part, though.
