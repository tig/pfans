It's not really "todays age" of instant on.  Instant on has been around for
at least 15 years or more.  It just makes you drive with more attention on
oncoming traffic, bridges, entrance ramps or other hiding places instead of
on the road.

If you are the unfortunate sap to get the instant on, than no detector in
the world will help you.  The idea of a high quality sensitive RADAR
detector is to  warn you by receiving a previous signal from the officer
trying to instant on someone in front of you.  In other words, if you are
the one out in front, than the only thing a detector tells you is that
you've been had.  Like I said in my earlier post, recognizing places that
cops can hide & slowing down momentarily at those points is the only thing
that will save you from a ticket when you're alone or out in front.

Some tips.

Night time is a harder to recognize these places or cars so don't expect to
get as much visible warning if any at all.

Let someone else be the "bear bait" that's also driving fast.  I always let
a fast driver lead about 50 yards or more.  If someone's going to get a
ticket, it'll be the guy in front.  A perfect example is when I was
returning from Chicago & I picked up on some woman that was flying at
night.  I said perfect!  She stayed in the fast lane so I followed at about
1/8 of a mile back in the right lane.  We went for about 45 minutes going
95 plus.  Then we catch up to a   guy in a Mustang and this idiot starts to
follow the woman in the fast lane right behind her (at a safe distance.)
About ten minutes later...Bang!  My V-One showed full on to the front & a
State Cop in the median pulled out just behind the two, way in front of me
as I slowed (sans brake lights) & he pulled both of them over.  Bummer.  I
lost my bear bait so I had to continued on my way but at only about 8 mph
over cause I was the only one out there at that point.  It must take the
smooth bullshit (good bullshit) talent of John Hall, balls, stupidity or a
badge to be flying in the middle of the night in the fast lane with little
to no traffic & to think that you're not going to get caught.

Stay in the right lane whenever possible to increase cosine error with
oncoming RADAR.

After using about 15 RADAR detectors of different brands in the last 20
years, I personally use a Valentine One for my serious high speed
adventures.  The directional indications are priceless.  Some of the other
units that I've owned may give you an equal or even a better warning, but
they are all so close in sensitivity now that it becomes more of a battle
between the other features.  What I mean is the V-One will talk to you in a
clearer *language* so you can interpret and respond quickly and
appropriately with less guess work.  Others have a more confusing audible
and visible display & therefore may take a second longer for you to figure
out the warning causing excessive reactions on every alert.
The windshield mount is brilliantly designed, you can Quickly & Easily
adjust the muted volume.  It counts the number of signals your receiving.
Has a remote display option which I personally love.

I know I sound like I work for V-One but believe me I don't.  As a matter
of fact, they pissed me off when they offered their upgrade.  I signed up
for it immediately & it took about 10 months before they said OK, time to
send yours in.

Happy motoring & remember, fly fast & low without ruffling feathers.  Or be
like a duck in water...paddle like hell underneath but be calm, smooth &
collected above.
