PT-with soon to be discretely installed deer whistle in the grill

Hi Phil,

Given the deer population in LA, I'm guessing this was in jest.
However, since they only cost $1 or so, I did search the www for what
they're about after we killed Donner with our bimmer.  Some funny
things;  I think it was a U. of Mich undergrad thesis that stated
something like we found no evidence that deer can hear ultrasound nor
did we find that the deer whistles produced any (this is allegedly how
they work).  I heard of another test by NY State Police where some of
the cars had them installed and some didn't and they saw no correllation
in the number of hits (it's anectdotal at this point and clearly not
double-blind).  There are plenty of people that swear by them.  My dad
had them on his cars - I have none on mine.

FWIW,
Kurt
