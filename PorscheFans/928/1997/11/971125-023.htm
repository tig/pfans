928 fans,

If you have a set of sad looking wheels on your 928 I can not more highly
recommend Al Reed Polishing!!

I just got a set of design 90 wheels back from him (thanks Alex) and they
look great!!  They had started life as normal D90 wheels and were chromed by
Robert Wood back in 92-93 and subsequently saw a rough life that caused the
chrome to come off making them look terrible!!  I called R. Wood and Wheel
Enhancements and was about to send them to W.E. and saw a post from someone
about Al Reed, so I called and sent him the business.

He sent me back a set of gorgeous wheels that are going to be shod with BFG
R1's tomorrow!!  I am so EXCITED!!  993's at TWS better watch out now for
sure!!

What he does is paint the inside of the wheel black so you don't see the
massive brake dust build up that we all experience, and then polishes the
face of the wheel to a brilliant shine.  They look almost chrome in fact.
 Then for permanent protection he clear powder coats them.

BTW I don't work for Al Reed, I am just a happy customer.  Did I mention the
cost?   How does $75/wheel grab you?!  About half what R. Wood or W.E.
charge!

Anyway if you are considering having wheels refinished then call:

Al Reed Polishing
714-632-3907
3010 E. Coronado St #A
Anaheim, CA 92806

Tell him James Morrison from TX sent you.

Cheers and keep it over 100!
