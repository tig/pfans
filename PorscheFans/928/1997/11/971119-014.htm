This is a great question. 

There was a lot of discussion earlier about stiffness of aluminum
structures but what about the galvanic action where the steel chassis meets
the aluminum skin and suspension components in our sharks? I assume porsche
must use some form of sealer (urethane?) or something. The nose and tail
pieces are urethane aren't they? I have never noticed any of the tell tale
white crystals growing around the perimeter of the body panels and my car
is an early edition (old). I used to have a '66 Rover 109 that did exhibit
aluminum corrosion. The constructin of the Rover was suprisingly similar
(Duralloy shell over a steel chassis).

When we have reconstructive surgery done do we need to worry about
resealing the components against galvanic corrosion?

Anybody got the answer?
