I was afraid of that!   There were two of us there at the appointed
place and time.   The other person was a buddy.  As you noted, there
were no 928s in the parking lot, but I discounted that due to the
weather.   My buddy was here to help me get the quarter glass installed,
which is why I didn't want to chance driving it to Fridays.

In an attempt to find you, I strolled through the restaurant about every
ten minutes beginning at 1:00.   I had a black tee-shirt with HUGE
Porsche emblem covering the front of the shirt.   I figured if anyone
were there looking for us, they'd at least spot the shirt and ask.  We
sat at a large table against a window scouting for any others.   I
brought a box of magazines and brochures which were placed on the table
so that anyone strolling by would see what we were all about.    As a
final cover, I informed the gal at the entrance (who was responsible for
seating people) that we were here for a meeting of Porsche people and to
kindly direct them to our table.   That was at about 1:15.   What did I
miss?

I'm sorry we didn't hook up - I'm at a loss how it could've happened.
In any case, we'll attempt another one after the holidays.   Thanks for
coming all the way up here - let's call it a trial run!
