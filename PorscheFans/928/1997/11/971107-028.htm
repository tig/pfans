>Fine. Where do you intend to do this?

I just want to clear a couple things up, even if I did get my car up to
those speeds I do not intend to attempt this on public roads. It's more of
an engineering challenge for my mechanic and a hobby for me than anything
else. And knowing you've taken a 928 past 200 mph is something to be proud
of. Now, there are strips where this testing can be done, and during all
this talk, I don't expect anyone to try this on public roads.

Now when my car goes to Europe this summer, I will probably hit 150-170 on
some roads, but at that speed, another 30 mph is a very big step up, and is
insane on an Autobahn (most of which look like our clogged US freeways
these days). Now 150 is acceptable and rather common with the right road
and traffic conditions, and in the right car.

Anyway, just wanted to let everyone know.
