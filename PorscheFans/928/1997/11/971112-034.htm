<< Bottomline: Since I "okayed" this guy, the $1200 loss comes 

out of MY personal pocket.  What a gutless, sniveling, mealy-mouthed 

prick.

 If he even attempts anything else like _this_ on PorscheFans, I will 

have to post all the e-mails and the rest of our private investigator's 

file on him.

 Ahhh. Now having done my civic duty, I feel much better.>>

I for one wouldn't mind reading it now.  Why don't you see if you get $1200
satisfaction out of posting it?

And by the way, send me 50 accelerators and I will sell them by next week and
drop a check in the mail to you.  This should make up for your $1200 loss.
 If that works out ok then I'll take 5000 more immediately.  Thanks.

And by the way, does he really own the car?
