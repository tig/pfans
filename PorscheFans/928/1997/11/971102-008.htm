I read about Paul's unfortunate upcoming visit with his local police officer
in Dedham Court.   I have "beaten" speeding tickets on three occasions, and
thought that I would offer some comments.

First of all, Paul said that the summons showed radar "estimate".  In most
jurisdictions, a radar summons in prima facie evidence of guilt, and most
courts will throw out any appeal.  Speeding convictions by radar are handled
administerially, and are no longer usually a question of law.

BUT.  If the officer was using radar, but could only extimate the speed,
then I think you have an even chance of beating the rap.  The simple truth
is that the officer apparently didn't know how fast you were going, period.
If you can get the officer to admit that he really didn't know how fast you
were going, then I think the judge will throw it out.  Radar is absolute.
If the officer said he had a radar return that showed the car at x miles per
hour, then the case is closed.  But an estimate?  Well, now.  That is a bit
different.

I was clocked by radar once, and felt that the officer could have been
mistaken because of another large vehicle near me that was going about the
same speed.  I was in a VW Rabbit and the other vehicle was a large van.
Since I had spent twenty years in the air force and reserve working with
radar tracking systems for aircraft, I felt that I would appeal.  The
trooper said that he recalled no other vehicles.  Thereupon, the judge,
rather than get into a spitting contest between my allegation of another
vehicle and the trooper's denial of seeing one, dismissed the case upon my
paying court costs.....$50.00 I think.  (No points, No record).

I also got clocked by a trooper who followed my 944 for about ten miles
before stopping me.  He charged 73 in a 55 mile per hour zone.  I looked at
the speedometer in his Ford cruiser, and the speedometer had a band marking
55 to 85 miles per hour that was about one half inch wide.  There was NO WAY
that he could have identified 73 miles per hour on that speedometer at night
in moderate traffic.  I went to court to challenge, alleging among other
things, that the trooper singled me out because I was driving a small sports
car with out of state plates.  It was a Massachusetts state trooper, and was
he MAD when I said that.

Anyway, the judge held the case over, and I had to return to Haverhill for
another date for the trial, and.....the trooper NEVER showed.  Case dismissed.

The bottom line here, I think, is to hope that the police officer won't show
up for the hearing at all, which happens a lot.  Otherwise, in very nice,
and meek fashion, see if you can get the officer to admit that he really
doesn't know exactly how fast the car was going, and try to use that
reasonable doubt as a means to get the case thrown out, or at least the
infraction reduced to one over the limit.....

Good Luck!  Here in Maine, I worry about losing my license, but mostly I
worry about losing my insurance!
