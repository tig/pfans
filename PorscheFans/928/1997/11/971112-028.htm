Hey Scott-

Do you live around there?  The reason I ask is becuase John Ryall and I are
planning on meeting David Roberts in Asheville, N.C., probably on December 6
for a friend of mines Grand Opening of his bar.  

The bar owner, Adam, is my oldest friend, and I can't miss the opening.
 David is doing the mulimedia installations for him, and he can't miss the
opening (so he can fix all the problems, ha ha ha!).  John is riding along,
and maybe driving along in his 928 depending on how many people are going
along with us from here.  

If anyone else is in the area, as in Knoxville, Atlanta, Winston Salem,
Charlotte, and maybe even Columbia, let me know and we can see about planning
a drive or meet for Saturday or possible Sunday.
