Hello all!

I just wanted to pass along my experience with our local Porsche dealership
here in Albuquerque New Mexico. 
I recently purchased my 4th 928.  It's an 81 S ( euro ) and I need just a
couple things for it--unique to the european cars.  So I call the parts
department at Premier Motorcars and started to ask about ordering a couple
items ( new rear fog light, new keys, etc ) and before I could finish, this
jerk lights in to me and tells me that this car has no business in the United
States, and Porsche of North America will do NOTHING to help me purchase
parts for it.  This clown was rude beyond belief. Needless to say, I will buy
anything I need from anybody else.  I run an auto repair shop and have been
buying parts for porsches, audis and mercedes from these guys since 85.  I
had not spoken with this guy before, but the attitude is the same throughout
this dealership.  They sure as hell dont need my money......

Anybody out there have a rear fog light for my car?  ( I love my european
spec car, and am glad I bought it )
