  Be aware that the Parts and Technical Reference Manual specifies a different
  rear hub for cars using spacers vs. those without them.  My concern about
  using spacers on a car not originally equipped with them is that the hub may 
  have been reinforced to handle increased side-loading of the longer wheel 
  bolts.  (That is just my guess since I've never been able to compare the
  two different hubs.)
