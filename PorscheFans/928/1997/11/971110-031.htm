I was driving home... and generally in a bad mood and was going about 75 in a

off the exit and I notice a
cop behind me... He... pulled me over. He immediately told me and my
passenger to step out of the car, threw me on my hood... and searched me and
my passenger (a female). He
said we were estimated at 100 mph. He didn't have his radar on... He then
wanted to search the car (meanwhile, 4!! other cruisers pulled up...).  I
said no he can't, you have no right to, and you have no probable cause. He
said, "ok smart-ass, how about I tow this thing, throw you in jail, and
impound the car and tear the interior apart."... I then let up and said ok,
search the car, they looked through the whole car, and brought filthy drug
sniffing dogs in on my new leather to search. Eventually they let me go and
gave me a $450 citation.

I know how you feel, Paul!  When I was moving from India-no-place to Tucson
-- a clear, dry  Sunday morning (10am) in January 1995, westbound on I-70 in
Kansas, driving alone in a plain Mercury Tracer with Indiana plates, I was
stopped using instant-on radar (clocked at 73 in a 65 zone).  OK, so I get a
ticket after six years with clean record, no big deal.  The cop then
announced that "Sir, this is a major drug trafficing corridor, so I would
like to search your car."  I politely responded "Officer, this is the only
interstate across Kansas, so it must be a major corridor for everything.
 Thank you for asking, but I prefer you did not search my car."  He said "OK,
be that way.  I'm going to keep you here while we get a drug sniffing dog."
 It's his right to do this, so I wait... 40 minutes in the freezing cold
before fido shows up and finds nothing (even the socks were clean!).  I take
my ticket and go.  Six miles down the road, same county, cruise control
locked on 64 mph, I am stopped by one of the first officer's cohorts and
promptly written up for 87 mph!  The two tickets, which I did not contest,
cost $125, but the net cumulative three-year effect on my insurance was
(please sit down) $3,000!

I guess this is the same sort of logic that wants to cut school funding so we
can afford to build more prisons.  Wha'cha gonna do?
