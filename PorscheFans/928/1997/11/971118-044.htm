My recollection is that the original Elite weighed something like 1200
pounds! Of course, they didn't have to worry about how it would stand
up to a collision with a 5000 pound SUV. Nice as they are, the current
crop of roadsters are pretty hefty. I've always felt like an imposter,
a skinny guy in a 928, but I grew up in the era when the V-8 was king,
and 3500 pounds was just enough to keep the wheels on the ground.
