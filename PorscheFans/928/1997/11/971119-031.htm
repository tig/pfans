1st) Lotus Seven:  Fine, for anorexic thalidomide victims without elbows.
2nd) Epoxy structures:  Don't trust glue?  Hope you don't plan on flying
anytime soon, since the glue is what really holds those Boeings and Airbuses
together (those  visible rivets just hold the skin on).  The technology is
stable and proven.

Philip Adamson replied-
Woo!  Did I hit a nerve or something?? :-)
1st) I have all my limbs, most of my faculties, far too large an appetite and
really over-sized elbows.  And I find the Elise fits me just as snuggly as
the Seven.  At 5'11" and 160lbs I do consider myself lucky that I fit most
cars and certainly having owned three Lotus Seven's in the past 15 years I
may be accused of showing bias toward them.  Not accused, no... I admit it! I
am guilty!
 
(RG): No, Philip, you didn't hit any nerve except maybe that 'funny bone" in
the elbow.

(PA): 2nd) Oh.  Good point.  There's still the $45,000 difference to slow me
down, unfortunately (NB: NZ = $60k nwe LotusElise, $15k used Lotus Seven).

(RG) Wait until Proton (Malaysia, Lotus' new owners -- Like S. Korea's Kia, a
"license & build Mitsubishi's here, learn how to do it, then start designing
our own" operation.  Proton are also silent joint venture sponsors with
Petronas, Malaysia's national oil company, of F1's Sauber team, using Ferrari
engines and ex-Honda F1 engine genius Isamu Goto to jumpstart things.) cranks
up production and the 2 year waiting list disappears.
 
Also, Lotus used to delight in introducing unproven, poorly tested technology
in poorly built cars with zero (or less!) margin for error.  Many of the
Elise's newer elements (e.g., bonded aluminum extrusions, Stack electronic
instrument clusters, etc.) are well proven elements with significant
real-world survivability as demonstrated by years of field use in aircraft,
motorcycles and other applications.  IMHO, a major manufacturer could sell
the Elise for less than the price of a Mazda Miata.

No bruised nerves, PA, just pleasure from the kind of "simplicate & add
lightness" engineering in the (purported, but questionable at times) spirit
of the Porsche's we love.

P.S.
Go find any film featuring the late, great Zero Mostel.  Watch him move, even
dance, and you'll appreciate this "porker's" interest in lithe, graceful
machines that let me get up on my own toes and dance.
