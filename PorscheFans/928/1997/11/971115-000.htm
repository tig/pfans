I recently had a new Denon CD stereo put in my '85 928 replacing the =
original factory-installed Blaupunkt unit.  The gentleman installing it =
claimed to not be able to locate the original factory amp in the =
vehicle, so he decided to wire around it in the process.  I thought this =
was a little bizarre but didn't have time to argue and left thinking =
that I could always get a new one or eventually locate it through a =
factory manual.  Does anyone know where this unit is housed in the =
vehicle - I really don't want to have to poke around and try to find it =
myself.  Maybe someone has already solved this little dilemma - if so, =
what is the brand (is it Blaupunkt) and is it worth using compared to =
some of today's units.  I can't really notice a quality decline since =
the amp has been bypassed, however I did go to a CD unit so that may =
account for the improvement.   Any input would be greatly appreciated.
