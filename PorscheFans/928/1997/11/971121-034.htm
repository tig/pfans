It's an RF choke. Basically a "transformer" with only one winding. Constant
DC current passes through it virtually unscathed. AC currents (such as
spikes caused by the ignition coil and opicked up by the radio's power
cable) have difficulty getting through.

Thus you want the choke mounted as close the the radio end of the power
cable as possible.
