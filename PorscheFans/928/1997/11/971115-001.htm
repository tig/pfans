Dear Barry and fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

The location of the Amp (for cars with the steering wheel on the left) is
under an access panel located to the right of the passenger seat. Remove the
two thumb screws and pull in towards the seat. The panel will reveal the amp
and also the wiring tothe rear hatch opening button.

For the gentleman on his way to Seattle in need of a good detector;
"Valentine One" is by far the best. Car & Driver did a comparison test
earlier this year and found it to be better than all others tested by a wide
margine in nearly every category. They are not cheap, but as the saying
goes, "You get what you pay for".

Recent discussions that compare the 928 to an NSX or Corvette or even the
911 are IMHO an excersize in futility. As many of the respondents mentioned,
the 928 was not made to do what those other cars were designed to do.
However, what it was designed to do, no other car does so well. The car is
the most luxurious autobahn cruiser that can also, in a pinch, carry four
passengers, or a considerable amount of cargo for its size. It was, until
recently, the fastest production car. It is one of the strongest and
(arguably) safest Grand Tourers ever made. It is extremely agile and nimble
considering its weight. The braking caracteristics are only surpassed by
very costly exotics.

All in all, the 928 is not the best car for any single given criterion.
However, as an overall performance car it is, again arguably, among the top
ten or (IMHO) top five cars ever made. 

I think most of us already know that. Slowly others are learning it too.
Happy motoring. Ed
