Hmm...

>where the weather was fairly warm

Probably found anywhere in the Southern half of the US, although snow is
found  to some degree almost everywhere except on the southern coasts.

>I could drive a 928GT around without fear of police harassment

Depends on what you mean by harassment. Paul's story has more to do with
sociology, or with highly decorated cars fitting a "criminal" profile. If
you don't go in for bright yellow cars with big wings and loud exhausts
(purely a matter of taste; no value judgement intended), the police issue
comes down to traffic law enforcement. On this front, I'd suggest Texas as
a place with wide open spaces and a tradition of high speeds outside of
built-up areas. Arizona and New Mexico are plenty warm, but not as
comfortable for serious speeders.

>T1 Internet connections were cheap

T1 service is still foolishly priced across the US, but it's probably far
less expensive than in NZ and will be coming down quite a lot during the
next decade or two (remember ISDN, the technology of the future and the
past all in one) as xDSL appears.

>BTW, although I'm not a drug pusher or a pimp

So you say. Nixon said he was not a crook.

>I do have rather long hair, and could easily be mistaken for a rock musician.

Ooh, can I have your autograph?

>Would this need to be taken into account in choosing a location?
>I assume Alabama is out?

Well, I have met long-haired rock musicians in Alabama, so this is not
clear. However, you probably talk funny.

Keep that up and you'll have a spare "t" or two as well.
