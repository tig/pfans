Thanks to Leonard and John for pointing out (without making me feel like
a complete idiot) that this is the way it's supposed to work.  Sure enough,
when I went back and read the owners manual again, there it was in black
and white!  Have you ever noticed how much easier it is to find something
when you know it's there?

Seriously, the warning light seems to function properly with the phone
on or off.  I'm assuming that I just didn't notice it due to the bright
sunlight last time I drove the car.
