  Through '83, each rear brake had an individual pressure regulator.  The
  regulators were mounted on the inner fender below the MC and each was
  fed by its own brake line from the MC.  For this configuration, there were
  four ports on the MC.
  
  In '84, the switch was made to a single pressure regulator to control
  both rear brakes.  The pressure regulator screwed directly into the MC
  and resulted in only three ports on the MC; the split into two brake lines
  occurred further downstream.  I don't have a P&TR manual with me, but my 
  guess is that the MC from the '84 design was carried forward to the S4s.
  
  As to whether the '87+ MC is absolutely required when doing the conversion,
  that sounds like a question for the experts (928 Int'l or Devek).
  (Richard B. - did Lucky switch out your MC when he upgraded your brakes?)
