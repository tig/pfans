Hi Richard:

I'll try to answer your questions and/or follow-up.  Hope the 928 list
can jump in and help as well...

Can't tell from that number.  Also I do not have info on non-US spec
cars, someone else might be able to help here.  Barring that, the only
other way is pull the 'cardex' sheets on your car although again, I
don't know if that is available for it.

Each engine has a specific code stamped on it.  The engine code should
be ________ (in the US it would be M28/43 for manual & M28/44 for
automatic).  I do not have the engine serial numbers for euro cars. The
1985 engine for a non-US is a 16-valve car, easily identifiable by the
'spider' air tubes vs. the US has the 32-valve engine with big square
airbox.

Yes - Vehicle Id Number as well.  The 'DS' portion indicates a 1983
model not an '85.  The ZZZ portion indicates non-US car although note
all fenders are stamped ZZZ, even in the US.  Have you looked for
stickers at other locations as outlined on my webpage?

Depends on your budget.  Why do this though?  Most manuals are more
valuable than the auto version, at here in the U.S.

Correct, do not add foreign fluids.  Have the level checked it is
probably low.  The 928 transaxle saw improved Borg-Warner synchros from
model year 1985, although all 928 gearboxes are in general, balky when
cold.  Another tip is when first starting out, pause the shifter in
neutral for a count or so between shifts to aide in rpm matching so the
lever slides to the next gear without force.  Once the 'box is warmed it
should shift quite nicely, unless the synchros are worn or someother
maladies affect it...
