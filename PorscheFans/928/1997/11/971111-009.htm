><chuckling> Hey, Leonard, it's you guys that talk funny.

But becasue NZ TV has a high percentage of US programs (as well as UK
programmes), we can understand them. They hardly ever hear a NZer, so have
trouble understanding what we say, especially if we talk fast.

I had a huge problem in LA with hotel staff looking at me funny whenever I
asked them a question.

That's fine.

I've an even better idea. Since it sound's like you've got enough speed
camera photos to wallpaper a medium sized room, shouldn't we be putting
them on a website, so _everyone_ can enjoy them?
