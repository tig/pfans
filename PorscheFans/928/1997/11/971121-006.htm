Hmm, I don't think I agree with that answer. One thing the Weissach design
appears to do is cause the wheel to toe in as the spring is compressed. So less
spring compression means less toe-in. On the other hand, the book "Project
928" talks about that design as being specifically intended to counteract
trailing throttle oversteer, which was being caused by compliance in the
rubber bushings when the rear suspension used straight wishbones. Now, I
can see how a retarding force at the wheel, plus compliance in the
suspension, would tend to make the wheel toe out, but I don't see why
the Weissach design specifically counters that. Have any of you looked
at it hard enough to understand just how it moves and why?
