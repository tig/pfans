For the past several months my wife and I have been blasting around the
southwest in our white/tan '86 5-sp, having entirely too much fun, and
I'd like to extend heartfelt thanks to Rob Gold ('86 5-sp) here in
Tucson for steering us towards the most amazing car on the planet!  We
met last summer at a bookstore while looking at the latest Dupont
Registry and got to talking about dream cars.
	I confessed that I was considering a 308 GT4, had driven one, and
really liked it.  He then told me about his adventures seeking his dream
sports car, and that after driving a 308, had bought a 928 instead.  I
confessed that I knew little about them, but that after driving a
friend's 944, had decided to look further...  Whereupon he laughed and
explaned the differences between 4-cylinders and 8-cylinders in the most
graphic terms!
	His 928 was parked out front, so I went out and looked it over.  When I
came back in, he told me about a low milage '86 model on consignment at
a lot just a couple of miles from where we were talking.  After a brief
look I took my wife back for a test drive and we were hooked.  Following
Rob's sage advice we reviewed the car's maintenance history with the
shop that has done most of its work, Radmacher Porsche Service, here in
Tucson.
	With new Bilstiens, water pump, timing belt, and a host of smaller
things done in the past year, Dave Radmacher was confident that the car
was in the ballpark at its $12,500 asking price.  Rob Gold agreed.  When
I offered them our '93 Bronco ($10,000 wholesale blue book) and a grand,
they accepted!
	Thus far we've been all over Arizona, and made a trip to Palm Springs
with no squawks.  The 24 MPG at 80 MPH is easy to take.  But the icing
on the cake is that the insurance is just $15 (Fifteen!) more than the
Bronco every six months.
	Okay, here's the downside.  Since I was considering spending twice that
for the right 308 GT4, I figured that I would talk my sweetie into
spending the balance on upgrades to prep her Teutonic Toy for the PE
100!  Wrong-oh, moose-breath!  Oh, well.  Gimme time, gimme time...
	Anyway, hope I'm not being too long winded.  Just had to share my
neophite 928 experience.  Thanks again, Rob, for steering me to this
incredible car!
