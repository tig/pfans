Hi Leonard,
The saga continues.....Finally got my car out today and did some time, speed,
and rpm evaluations. Firstly, I am running 245x45x16's on the rear now. 
(previous post regarding the 160mph at 4550 rpm was on 245x50's) 
(though that didn't seem to be much of a factor .... see below)

I checked speedo accuracy on the highway using the mile markers. 
(32 miles worth of evaluations)  
At an indicated 60 mph, it takes my car 61 seconds to cover a mile, meaning
my speedometer is 1 mph optimistic......not too bad, I thought.
But here's where it get's wierd......
At 60 mph, my tach reads 1725 rpm. (reading between the 200 rpm hash marks) 
At 80 mph, my tach reads 2300 rpm.   
Which would be 4600 rpm at 160 mph. (The taller tires only made it turn 50
rpm less)

FWIW, One published spec I found in Performance Portfolio gives a speed of
32.5 mph per 1000 rpm, and another gives 33 mph per 1000 rpm. (in 5th gear)
Which would figure to be about: 
60 mph at 1850 rpm, 80 mph at 2450 rpm, and 160 mph at 4900 rpm.   
While my car figures to give a speed of very near 35 mph per 1000 rpm.....? 

My car idles between 650 rpm and 700 rpm. Seems about right to me.....
(now checking spec)
The spec says idle is supposed to be 675 rpm, + or - 25 rpm. (not adjustable)
I would think from my current speed verses rpm observations, that my tach
must be way out of wack, but the idle speed doesn't seem to bear this out.
My rev limiter does work, (scares the bejesus out of me when it kicks in) and
from the few times it's kicked in, (not intentional, mind you) I believe it
cuts fuel at around 6600 rpm. (the spec says 6600 rpm)   

As you can probably guess, I'm still confused. 
Perhaps I have some kind of super-duper gear in my car!   (top speed = warp
9)  :)

Best Regards,
Greg S.
