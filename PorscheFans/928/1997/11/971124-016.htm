	Correct.  You'll want a hand pump, which you can get from any
auto
	parts store.  The plugs are all Allen, I think 17mm.  Be easy
torquing
	them back in afterwards, as the torque specs are much lower than
	I would have expected.

	>>Are the only tools I need are snap ring pliers, 

	Really?  For what?  I'm sure there were no snap rings in mine,
just a
	plain threaded hole for the allen plugs.

	>>and is there any advice anyone could give. 

	It's a trivial job, you'll have no problem with it.  Except a
sore hand from 
	pumping the oil in a couple of tablespoons at a time!

	You'll need the car to be on FOUR jackstands, of course, to make
sure
	it's perfectly level front-rear.  My trick for this is to jack
up the rear points
	first, putting stands under the front points, then jack up the
monstrous
	aluminum cross-member of the Weissach rear suspension
(carefully!),
	and then put the stands under the rear jack points.
