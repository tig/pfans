I was wondering why my calculations on a 245 x 45 tire came to 817
revolutions per mile, while you were quoting 840 rev. per. mile. The old
rolling radius theory got me!
I'll look for the mfg. figures.

Ok, now you're losing me, don't the calculations show that tire size does
indeed cause the aforementioned discrepancy between speedo and tach?  
If the speedo is innacurate due to tire size, then shouldn't tire size also
cause a difference between the speedo and the tach?......wait..... I see.....
even if the speedo is wrong, the tach should be in relation because they are
both driven off the non-changing drivetrain. 
.........Damn, I'm still confused.  It still looks like tire size changes the
relationship. 
Am I just dense or what?

Ok, I'll try the ol' calibration run. Hopefully tommorrow.

Perhaps I should just stick to simple "the tire is round" (unloaded)
assessments and quit trying to calculate with the big dogs.... (now
retreating to porch) 
(still wanting to cypher and ministrate.....just don't have the brain
capacity)
