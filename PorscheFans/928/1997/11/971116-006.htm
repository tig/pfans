I pulled my archive drive out in the weekend to try and find the work I had done with the
G-analyst mounted in a 911 race car a few years ago.  Unfortunately I didn't keep it, but
along the way I found a little simulator I wrote, originally to play with performance and
gear-change points on the Lotus 7 race car I had at that time.  The program puts a couple
of dials on the screen - RPM & MPH - and a gear shift pattern and various other displays
and then lets you use the mouse to input the gas pedal, left click for change up, right click
for down, and then does times on 0-60, 0-100, standing quarter etc.

I'm going to parameterise the whole thing so I can do the 928 and whatever else I feel like
plugging in, the only trouble is that I did it all with tables and approximations and fudge
factors that I derived, not real live, accurate calculations, because I had
that data for the Lotus.  I need some formulae and I am sure that Leonard, Chris and many
of you out there will be able to help. (I never did mechanical engineering!)  The prize for the
answers I need is that anyone who wants the finished program will be sent it!

First - I have 20 - 40mph, 30 -50, 40 - 60 etc times in top gear - how do I calculate torque & bhp
from these?

I seem to remember bhp is a function of torque & rpm.  Is it just a straight calculation, and if so,
what?

What is the real world equation for "I am doing 50 mph in at 3000 rpm and I have my foot flat,
how fast do I accelerate...?"  (Keep in mind I will have the torq at any rpm available.)

I will also include drag, frontal area, tyre friction and all that into the software.  (It already does
wheelspin - the speedo has two pointers, one showing wheel speed, one showing actual
speed during wheelspin.)  None of this real stuff was in the orginal apart from this approximation
of wheel spin.

Oh - and I don't mind doing it all in km/h, kW, nm and other metric things!

Looking forward to wasting a lot of time finishing this off.
