To quote Emerson (Ralph Waldo E., not E. Fittipaldi), "A foolish
consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds..." You see, in the
U. S., we can contemplate ratios in any units (264 vs. 261), but
the only absolute unit of weight we have any mental model for is pounds. 
Any other unit must be converted, so I was doing the work for the
rest of us.

That still leaves the question of the extra 150 lb. A few pounds of
brakes, a few pounds of radiator shutter machinery, a little 
differnce in the bumper; there just don't seem to be enough changes
to account for the extra weight. Where is it?
