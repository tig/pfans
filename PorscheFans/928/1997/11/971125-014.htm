Heh heh - I love the Mercedes comment!

I associate with a group of Classic Car purists who have historic Lotus
race cars, old XKs, Ginetta, Morgan, TR and that sort of thing.  The Porsche
club are looked at as the penile extension brigade - the income-over-ability
club.  (Apart from 356 owners, of course!)  It's good natured, but it is always
an underlying theme.  For example - we run Classic race meetings.  If it rains
on race day, how do we ascertain whether it's safe to race?  Simple - send the
911s out for a qualifying session.  If they all come back, then it's safe...

Anyway.  When I bought the 928 it was one of those funny little sequences  "titter,
titter... Philip's bought a porker... tee hee"   So one weekend we went on a "round
the cape" run of the East Cape.  I took my Lotus Seven and handed the 928 over
to the newsletter editor for the weekend.  It's become something of a legendary
event.  "John wrote about Philip's car and LOVED it.  Wow.  John liked a Porsche!"

Since then I have had a few comments from the most dedicated and vocal Porsche
knockers along the lines of "It's not a real Porsche... it's much better... of all of
them, this is one that I could/would/would love to own..."

And I don't have to cough into my hand when I say "Porsche" anymore.

Phil and the Group:

So far, the ininformed group has included my accountant (who says I should
not have put money in another toy car but says she loves my 944 anyway...)
and a few others who  -are-  intelligent but frankly aren't car folks.  They
buy Mercedes SL's because they are "cute" and then gripe about the service
and gas costs.  I remind them that Mercedes is a TRUCK company that dabbles
in automobiles, and that usually ends the discussion-- thank God!  They also
accuse me of grabbing the 928 to use as a penile extension and a last grab
at some lost youth.  I get to sagely point out that in addition to the
'factory' fixture I've had a garage full of these 'extensions' since youth,
and that my real youth  -started-  a lot later than theirs.  Usually ends
THAT discussion.

It's the company I keep, to put it succinctly.
