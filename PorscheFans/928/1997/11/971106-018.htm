So when my mechanic is finished with my engine, installed the new
crankshaft and other modifications to the oiling system (also dropping in a
Devek radiator and oil cooler), and Autosport re-sets the limiter to 8,500
RPM, my theoretical top-speed will be:

8500/2.72 = 3125 rpm.
3125/840= 3.72
3.72 x 60= 223 mph

Well, to achieve that speed, other things must be toyed with. What kind of
HP are we talking about to get the motor to run at that speed in top gear?
What other systems in the car need to be worked on (fire system, no cage,
yet...)? I assume braking must be augmented, along with traction. So larger
tires in front, and rear, meaning wider fenders to accept them. Are the GTS
brakes sufficient, or should aftermarket Brembo systems with 14" rotors be
looked into? I can't wait for someone to build a 928 based bar that breaks
200 mph, and 4 second 0-60 times, and with looks to match. At speeds such
as 200 mph, aerodynamics must really come into play, is the S4 design
capable. I understand that drag is relatively high for such a jazzy looking
car (and wider fenders won't help).
