Hey Leonard,

I am a reader of the 928@porschefans list - and whilst not yet a 928 driver
(still looking around for a good one) I love reading the list.

In response to your queries about the possible rear-drive replacements for
the current US cop cars, there has been a bit of press over here (Australia)
recently about us exporting our locally made Commodore to you guys under the
Chevrolet badge.

The Commodore is a large-sized family sedan built by the GM subsidiary
"Holden" with a large (v6/v8) front engined/rear-drive layout that is
Australia's top selling car. In a recent model revision, the GM executives
have decided to export the Commodore to the US and Europe.

The car is powered by either a slightly different version of your 3.8l Buick
V6 or a Chev 5.7l V8.

Mentioned in a few of these articles was the strong desire for GM to get
hold of a large powerful rear-drive sedan to be able to secure some police
sales in the US.

These cars can be made to be fairly quick and have been used as police cars
over here (and in NZ) for about 18 years (in various forms).

As I said, this is just what some of the motoring press are saying over here
and there is always posts about it in "aus.cars" newsgroup.

Feel free to post this to the porschefans list if you think is would be
useful.
