The cruise control on my 78 doesn't work, is there a common fault I should be
looking for. I've checked the fuses and they seem to be ok.  Also the fuel
pump has been hot wired, I seem to remember in a past digest, someone
mentioning this as a common thing, why would someone have done this and what
do I need to do to fix it. I think the fuel pump needs to be changed, so I
would like to fix the wiring at the same time, the car starts straight away
when it's cold, but if I stop for 10 min after driving for 30 min it is
really hard to start.  I believe this could possibly be the fuel pump check
valve, also I can hear the pump when I turn on the ignition, is this normal?
It's been like that since I brought the car.

Thanks
