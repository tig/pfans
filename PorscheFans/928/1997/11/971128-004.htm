Dear fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

As some of you saw at the "Frenzy", I had an oil leak. It turned out to be a
bad crankshaft oil seal (front). The 928 technician had replaced the old one
with a defective one. He has since replaced the defective one, and all seems
well (so far). 

A little history: Before I knew it was the seal, I thought it was the oil
pan. I found all the pan bolts to be loose (less than finger tight).
Naturally, I got them snugged-up. The oil leak continued, but was somewhat
reduced. That's when I found the leaking seal.

The amount of torgue to be applied on the pan bolts is very little (8+2 Nm).
DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN! The gasket is cork and will not function effectively if
it's too loose or too tight. Next Spring, I will drop the steering rack and
remove the pan. While I'm in there, I'll replace the conrod bearings and
install a "GTS" oil-pan baffle (recommended by Kim Crumb).

Happy motoring. Ed
