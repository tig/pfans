Hot damn what a good time!  

And was it hot - 96 degrees on track according to the dash computer. 
Four 928s went to do battle and I heard rumors it was a GGR AX record or
something.  One 928 served two drivers, Jim's "Nascar" 928 was home and
Philip Eskilden brought his 911T that day so we were down a few.  But
928 fans were abdundant everywhere, including the pit area with our
water-cooled brethren.  911 owners are starting to get nervous!

And with good reason too, fast 928 lap times were in the .32 - .33
second range so we're knocking on hotshoe territory, definately hot tire
territory!  Just wait 'till we have some more experience and watch the
times drop even further!

The last turn of the track was a series of two sharp rights after a nice
long downhill straightaway.  A tricky section indeed as the 'straight'
had a slight right kink over a skidpad area and psychologically worse it
was lined by a brickwall to the left, and a hurricane fence straight
ahead at the end.  This did not deter the 928s from holding the throttle
to the last second (and some past the braking zone!) to come blazing
through the first right hander.  No one blasted the fence thank god!

I got to tell you all these 928rs have spirit and are all Top Guns in my
book.  With all the excitement of race day please forgive me if I've
forgotten your names - Alan Ng, Philip Eskilden, James McMillen (and
wife?), new 928r Richard (?), etc.  GREAT SHOW!

Speaking of Top Guns, I couldn't help but make a correlation to the
movie with our instructor Mike Mitchell - his name, the helmet and the
sunglasses, strapping into his car, etc.  but the kicker is when he
revealed that his attraction to the 928 was what got him into Porsche's
in the first place!  

Matter of fact, alot of folks were coming over to the 928s to take a
look inside, etc. and there was lots of talk in the 'grandstand' area
with people comparing how the 928 looks/sounds/attacks the track vs. the
other Porsche's.  

Again, great show all.  I am proud to run with you all and will get to
know you better next time we get together.  The 928s really are beloved
and will not go down quietly!

Ok, Go 'niners time (sorry TX fans!)
