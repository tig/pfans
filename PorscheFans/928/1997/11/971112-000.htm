Ian:

I'd like to know which dealer told you that, since the information he 
gave you is demonstrably false.

I have absolutely no interest in starting a 928-vs-NSX debate,
especially here on the 928 list, but I think the guy who's trying to
decide between the two cars deserves to hear VALID information. 

So...

The Acura NSX is one of the two most reliable cars -- in ANY
category or price range -- on the road... Last year (the first year
for which it was eligible), the '91 Acura NSX tied the Lexus LS400
for first place on the JD Powers 5-Year Reliability Survey

No NSX repair takes three weeks unless the repair shop is
incompetent.

The NSX is not "overly complicated"; on the contrary, it's 
much simpler than nearly any modern luxury car.

It requires no more maintenance than most other Hondas; the COMPLETE
maintenance schedule (excluding such things as checking the brake
pads and hoses, condition of the exhaust system, and alignment) is:

    Oil/filter changes every 7.5K miles
    Valve-clearance inspection every 15K
    Air cleaner, gear oil, and brake fluid changes every 30K
    Engine coolant changes every 45K
    Spark plug and fuel filter changes every 60K
    Timing-belt replacement every 90K.

No "simple work" requires dropping the engine, and very few major 
repairs do, either.
