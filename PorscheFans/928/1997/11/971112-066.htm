The first two are right, but not the third. The rolling radius of a tire is
less than the unloaded radius because the tire is squashed a little by the
weight it bears. Some tire manufacturers publish revolutions per mile
figures; if you can't find them, look for "rolling radius" to make the
calculation. Anyway, a published number for a 245/50x16 tire is 816
revs/mile, which turns 4550 crankshaft rpm and a 2.20:1 final drive into
152 mph, not 158.

Section 34 of the shop manual gives directions for R&R of the manual
transaxle; Page 34-6 tells you to remove the pulse transmitter for the
speedometer. The accompanying photo points to a location on the back of the
case, behind the final drive.

Until further notice, I'll take this as an indication that the 928 speedo
is driven, as are most speedos, by the transmission. That's why, even if
your big-tire calculation had given a much higher road speed, that would
not have explained the discrepancy you observed between speedo and tach,
since both instruments are driven from the car's drivetrain, and are thus
effectively geared together. Changing rear tire size will make the speedo
inaccurate, but at a given indicated road speed, the tach indication should
always be the same.

That's why I want you to try a calibration run (e.g., observe tach
indication in 5th at an indicated road speed of 80 mph, then multiply by
two to see what you should have seen at an indicated 160 mph). One or both
of the instruments may have been malfunctioning on that fateful day in AZ.

Yep. A taller tire is equivalent to a numerically lower final drive ratio.
Either way, there's less torque multiplication. As others on the list have
pointed out, you want to gear the car so that the engine can be turning at
the speed at which it makes its peak horsepower when the road speed is the
highest which can be attained with that power. Taller or shorter gearing
than this optimum value will result in lower top speed. You can estimate
this optimum gearing by calculations (as several of us have been doing in
public lately), but it's most accurately determined for a particular car
and engine by experiment.
