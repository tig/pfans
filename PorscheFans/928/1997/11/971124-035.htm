Steve and all:

Good thread & thanks for posting.  There will be no one perfect answer
of course.  Just wanted to throw a few more cents into the well (ha)
regarding my marketing quote "There is no substitute" in that I was
referring to the 928 overall, not Porsche.  Hell, all it took was a
brief stint of 911 ownership to convince me that I wasn't a hardcore 911
(and thus Porsche?) type of guy . It just didn't 'feel right' to coin
another slogan.  And I became less enchanted as I began to work on the
thing.  However, it was even a shorter (faster?) time to *know* the 928
was it for me.  One ride!

I do my share of bitching about it's foibles but as you know we have
what we have - there aren't any more coming out the factory, improved or
otherwise.  The 928 was such a limited production and specialized car,
most of it's R&D went to 'hard' & borrowed development costs ie.
power/drivetrain and so we're stuck with shrinking leather panels,
sometimes funky electronics, etc.  Did Porsche do a better job with the
Boxster?  Initial sales seem to indicate so but time will tell the big
picture on build quality, etc.

That's probably the main rub of why the 928 wasn't a market success. 
Just too big for the average Porsche customer who was used to a lithe,
little sportscar (and still are).  Too foreign sounding of an engine
(who cares if it's air or water cooled really witness the latest P-car
engines).  But the combination was irresistable for those US customers
which comprised 50% of the 928 market and obviously irresistable to us,
the 928 listmembers.

Yes, the fixers will require nurturing and understanding owners and the
really forlorn will become foodstuff for the healthier sharks.

Kinda' appropriate?
