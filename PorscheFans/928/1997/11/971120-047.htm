On my '83 you need to pull the center vent because the H-piece you 
mention below blends in under the center vent.

Once you have the center vent out, that's a good place to start 
prying.

I had the rest of my control unit apart but didn't have to take the fan 
switch apart. 1983. Spent a *lot* of time trying to figure out why the 
relay buzzed and things didn't work. Eventually found out there are at 
least two grounds running into that box. One is grounded at the 
cigarette lighter. But not on my car. Idiot PO had those wires running 
to the clock. Clock reset when the door was open and headlights were on.
Digital clock survived the abuse. When properly grounded the relay 
works as its supposed to.

Upshift idiot light on my car is totally random. Stopped at a traffic 
light it happily flashes its up arrow. I'm expecting to find the same 
kind of non-connected ground problem as I found on my HVAC controls.
