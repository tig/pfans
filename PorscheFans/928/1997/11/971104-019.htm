Phil,

Look at it this way. You should probably back up your drive at least =
every three or four years.  In the meantime, think of all the crap you =
had accumulated on the drive that you did'nt know how to get rid of =
because some diabolical bastard deliberately designed it to be =
"Uninstall Proof".  Also, think of all the time you did'nt waste messing =
around with tapes, and jazz drives etc.

Further, you can now throw the old drive away and for just a few hundred =
dollars, replace it with a 9.3GB drive that will allow you to download =
even more useless junk!  Progress! It's wonderful, isn't it?

Gene O'Rourke=20
