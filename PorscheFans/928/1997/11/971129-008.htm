In light of recent posts of those looking for a 928
I noticed these interesting ads cruising through traderonline.com for various reasons:

First and clearly most interesting:
1987 PORSCHE 928 SE, color silver methalic, very good condition, grey leather interior, sunroof,am/fm cassette 
player, alarm system, new tires, second owner, please call 703-864-8728 or
703-534-2925 (703) 593-6679

Is this like  P. Adamson's (aposthrophe noted)? If so, it should be grabbed up by a knowing buyer.

*********I have seen this car. It is beautiful. And they have been trying to sell it for over three (about) 
months. I think they will be motivated to sell. I saw a local ad listing the price at $33,500.***************
