"I have driven several cars with DRLs including my VW GTI in which the
running lights, head lights, tail lights, and dash lights are on _all_
the time.  The only difference between DRL-mode and "real" lights is a
slight increase in brightness of the head lights.  It is _very_ easy
to drive at night for a long time with only the DRLs on because the
only indication is the position of the light switch."

So, what's your point?  The original argument posted in Tavern was that
DRLs cause people to forget to turn on their headlights, and therefore
they are driving without taillights. If, according to your response,
most of the manufacturers have all the lights on when the DRLs are on,
then such drivers WILL have taillights and dashlights. In my sample of
one manufacturer's approach, it is difficult to forget to turn on your
headlights at night because you will have a very dark dash.

 In effect you back up my case.

So let's get back to the Tavern, have a cold one and talk about the time
I drove my 928 from...
