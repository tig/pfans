Today was reasonably warm and sunny, so since I had the day off I decided to 
put the beast up on stands and poke around. Sure glad I did!  My car was
recently in
for service (the clutch slave and master gave up the ghost) and in the last
couple of
days, my clutch seemed to be slipping badly under any moderate to heavy
acceleration.
Of course I figured the worst (clutch may have been sprayed with hyd. fluid
then worn
badly and rapidly.)  On taking a peek in the inspection hole, I found my
clutch seems
to be in almost new condition with respect to wear...I had been VERY careful
after it
slipped a couple times, so I didn't think the disc was glazed. Decided to
crack open
the bleed valve on the slave and let just a tiny bit of fluid drain from the
line while
the clutch pedal was depressed. Took a test drive afterward and once temps
were up  to
normal, I tromped on the gas to redline in second and tried heavy
acceleration in 
4th and 5th as well. Result? No more clutch slip!  Too bad the dealer
couldn't have 
bled the line properly in the first place (he also lost the nut that holds
the hydraulic
line down against the suspension point....)

By the way, while I was under the car I decided to put a wrench on all the
oil sump
bolts...surprise surprise, they were loose! (Some were probably finger
tight.) Next time
anyone is under their 928, I recommend giving these bolts some attention.

Sorry for the ramble, but won't have too many more warm days around Chicago
this year.
