I find CarTest's calculation to be pessimistic. Apart from speed, I
wouldn't recommend the "dump" method unless you've got a lot of spare
clutches lying about. I use a hybrid method in which I rev up to 2-3000,
slip just a little (a gradual dump is more like it) with moderate throttle
and then mash the pedal. I get a sustained chirp while immediately moving
off the line. This technique does not appear to be modeled by CarTest's
"slip" or "dump" algorithms, both of which hold the car on the line for
about 1.5 seconds..

According to the factory spec book, the '88 Club Sport has the same
transaxle as the '89 GT, namely the G 28.55 (your build sticker should have
codes indicative of this and your transmission will be stamped with a code
like this). The G 28.55 has an 30:11 final drive (2.7272:1) and
transmission ratios of 3.7645. 2.5122, 1.7900, 1.3541, and 1.0000. If you
have this box and are running 245/45x16 rear tires, you should be getting
about 99 mph actual (most speedos indicate a little high) at 6800 rpm
(where the GT's rev limiter cuts in).
