Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

Sorry to post again so soon, but I received some news from PCA that I
thought should be posted on its own.

I got a call today from Don Spalding (PCA Special Intersest Group
Coordinator) regarding the "928 Registry". He will contact the PCA National
Office (Ruth Harte, @ Alexandria, VA) so that I can receive the materials
and information available to form the registry. There is yet hope  of
keeping it within PCA.

As soon as I sort through the material, I will inform the core volunteers
involved in formation of a "club" or "registry". I would have sent it by
e-mail to each of you, but this way is faster. Besides, more readers may be
interested in becoming volunteers now that they can read that something is
in the works.

Keep the shiny side up and happy motoring. Ed
.
