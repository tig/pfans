>[Philip Adamson]  Lots... but it's only NZ$.  I seem to remember that 85 mph
>(in a 60mph limit) last time cost me about $240.  (Does that sound right
>Andy & Andy?)

Not sure. I've _never_ had an open road speedcam ticket, only ones for
doing 65 in a 50k zone.

The last time I got snapped I was in my old Toyota Van. I pulled over,
started grilling the (_civilian_) operator and measuring where the camera
car was compared to the road, etc. I spotted him jotting down my reg. The
ticket never showed up.

The last time I went through a speed camera apeture in the 928, I was
_bang_on_ the 100k limit, with the passenger's nose pressed up against the
windscreen as we completed a ~1g deacceleration from 150km/h.

>- do the authorities' records of your speed camera events accumulate in

>[Philip Adamson]  Nope.  Not yet.  But I hear they are trying to.

Yes. Even though they promised that speed cameras would cure the carnage on
our roads, they haven't really made a dent in the number of deaths
(surprise) so they're currently developing the "policy" in order to allow
them to hide them and to add demerit points to the fine.

>- why no points when the evidence is sufficient to compel you to pay a fine?
>[Philip Adamson]  Because they, as yet, haven't managed to make it law that
>you have to identify the driver.  They got away with making the owner

>the car, but not personally for wearing demerits.  This could change, but
>at the
>moment I am still enjoying the freedom!

Enjoy it while you can. Now that Jackboot Jenny is the head honcho, you
don't have many months left to enjoy your dream car.

>- what are you doing for dinner Thursday?
>[Philip Adamson]  <falling about laughing> Oh, Leonard, I didn't think I was
>your type!!

Hey! Phil! I'm upset. You promised _me_ dinner on Thursday, you bitch!

On another subject, although my driving style remains much the same as it
used to, and even though my average speed is now higher that it used to be,
I find I get hassled far less in my nice metallic burgundy 928 than I used
to in my shocking white Honda CRX (with licnce plate AARRGH).

The last two times I got pulled over, the policeman freely admitted that
they'd never pulled over a 928 before and wanted to see what they looked
like (I think I have the only 928 in this province).

P.S. Help! I'm stuck in digest mode and can't get out!

What gives? I didn't used to be in digest mode. Now, by the time I get the
digest, all the jokes have died. The web page doesn't allow you to get out
of digest mode. Arrrgh!
