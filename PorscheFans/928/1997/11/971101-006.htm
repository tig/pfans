Subject: Me against a 928

While driving around Austin today in my '97 Mustang Cobra, I happened=
 across what 
appeared to be a 1987 or newer 928 S4, black.  We were side by side, and he=
 was 
looking at me like he wanted to race (my Cobra is a convertible).
Well, the light turned green and we were off.  Much to his chagrin, I=
 stomped him.  
I was 30 feet ahead until I hit 80, when I slowed down and he blew by.

So tell me this, honestly:  Did I beat him because I have a faster car, or=
 did I beat 
him because I'm a better driver?

I'd say you beat him because he didn't actually know you were there at all=
 and he was 
just driving normally.  When you thought he was looking at you he was just=
 admiring 
the reflection of his fine piece of German craftsmanship in the shiney new=
 paint of your 
Ford.

That's funny!  Mostly because I can picture myself doing that; looking at=
 the reflection 
of my car on any shiney surface.
