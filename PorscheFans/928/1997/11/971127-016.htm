Paul,

You don't have to take the insulting amount of money that the thieves =
who run your insurance company have offered you.  There are several =
things you can do.  Tell them that they insured your car for replacement =
value.  Let them go out and find one just like yours and buy it for you, =
or you find one and when you do, call them and let them negotiate a =
price and buy it for  you.

You did'nt quibble with them over the outrageous amount of money they =
extorted from you to insure the car.  So let them hold up their half of =
the bargain and replace it.

Further, contact the criminal fraud division of the Massachusetts State =
Attorney Generals office on this.  Copy the Insurance carrier, and the =
state insurance commission.  Also, contact the Better Busines Bureau, =
local newspapers, and any other members of the media you can get to.  =
Porsche dealers may be interested in adding their voices as well. =20

The time is long past when  people who drive so called "exotic" cars =
should stop being victimized by the disgusting bean counting actuaries =
who work for insurance bandits and who drive Chevettes and hate everyone =
 who does'nt want to be part of the same herd they belong to.

Maybe members of this  group and others like it should investigate the =
idea of starting our own non-profit insurance company for owners of =
Porsches, Ferraris, etc.  I'd be willing to bet that a few hours =
research on the net would come up with some surprising results vis-a-vis =
the percentage of accidents that such cars are involved in as opposed to =
run of the mill station wagons, SUVs, and pickup trucks that the vast =
majority of people drive.

Who knows?  you might just throw enough of a scare into them so they'll =
grudgingly treat you fairly for fear that you'll become a major hassle.

Gene O'Rourke
