Hello,

San Diego area 928 fans.  I have located on the web a White '94 GTS automatic
with 32k miles on it.  If anyone knows of this car or could stop by Metro
VW/Audi and check it out for me I would really appreciate it.  I have been
looking for a nice GTS for some time (still wishing for Maritime Blue or
Riviera Blue) and am getting to the point where I am able and willing to move
on one if it is the right one.

For some pricing perspective a Silver '93 GTS two time Concours winner with
19k miles on it recently sold in Dallas for $41k.  This was a perfect car (I
know the owner) and I was about to make a bid for it when he told me he
already sold it.  I am patient and can wait for a nice one but I don't want
to miss a potential nice one either.

So, thanks in advance for any help you can give me.  Please respond directly
to me at:  forwheels@aol.com

Sincerely,
James Morrison
'88S4 Dunkelblau/Linen PCA Parade Concours Class Winner
