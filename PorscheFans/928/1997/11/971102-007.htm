First, I can't stand have to have the daily digest on this list.  This is
the first time I've checked it since it's switch to daily only.  For me
it's a pain in the butt.  Hope I can switch back one of these days.

Now on the RADAR issue.  Concerning #1 below, the best way to slow down
undetected it to install a brake light switch.  Trying to slow down by
e-brake or downshifting is a total waste of time as well as a very easy way
to lose control.  Even upon impending lockup those two methods are marginal
at best in slowing down a vehicle enough to make a difference on RADAR.  It
is next to impossible to beat instant on with using the brake pedal no less
the time lag of using the e-brake or d-shift method.

The benefit of a brake light switch is just a supplemental measure in the
use of common sense of; speeding when & where it is safe, USING your EYES,
experience and research to know how RADAR works and recognizing terrain
where cops can hide.  Staying in the right hand lane helps tremendously for
oncoming-moving instant on due to cosine error.  This is *one* reason why
cops will be in the left lane closest to the median during moving RADAR, to
reduce cosine error.  You being farthest to the right increases error which
results in a slower than actual reading.

With a brake light cancellation switch, you can slam on the brakes under
full control of the normal brake pedal and not have the rear of the car
light up like a Christmas tree at night.  I've gotten out of several
tickets with the use of alert eyes & a brake light switch when hit with
instant on after passing under an overpass..seeing the cop car sitting on
an entrance ramp..me slamming on the brakes w/o lights..and then my
Valentine One showing full on to the rear.  I slowed from 105 mph and he
never pulled out.  The 928 with very little nosedive on braking helps also.

I only suggest the addition of a B/L switch to drivers that are very alert
and on the ball enough to be aware of traffic behind them as to not get
rear ended.  Fifteen years of myself (and close friends & brother) driving
with a brake light switch has NEVER led to an accident or even a close call
because we THINK when we're using the switch.  Also, we incorporate a relay
to turn on a LED in the dash to remind us that the switch is activated.
Very useful after a noneventfull ride on the e-way finally pulling into
town or an exit ramp.

Now concerning #2 below.  Not to be a *Richard* or to be too critical but
RADAR is NOT the speed of light.  It is the speed of radio waves which is
slower, but not enough to matter.  And yes, brake lights after an instant
on is a psychological confirmation of you "Playing the Game" as I've heard
it being called by an officer.

    1.    I do not feel using the emergency brake for slowing down -
especially at high speed - is good advice.  If one side is adjusted
slightly diff than the other (YIKES); if the road is even mildly wet or
slippery (YIKES); if you must make even a slight turn (YIKES).  Simply
put, it is a PARKING BRAKE and using to slow from high speed is
potentially dangerous, IMO.  I think most of us can effectively use it
this way, but it's still very risky.

    2.    I don't think quickly slowing will confuse the law.   As you
know, radar is the speed of light, and Barney (Barnette?) can use the
initial reading to pull you over......even when he/she sees the reading
decrease.  I'm wondering if seeing brake lights come on might trigger a
psychological response confirming that said speeder 'knew' they were
speeding and ought to be pulled over?   Geez - way too detailed and way
outta my league here.
