Yeeehaa!  I can almost hear that mouse motor from here but have to agree
it would cause me some confusion at first sitting in the 928.  Good job
showing some restraint on it's maiden fire-up - I know of too many good
projects wasted by over anxious builders, though this was "back in the
days". 

Interesting comment on the low-end torque blips.  What kind of advance
are your running?  Here's a big plus for aftermarket 928 chips!

Ok, at least a few of us share your anxiety.  And more than that await
how long until the clutch pack grenades (knocking on wood!).  Ok, will
just be an excuse to go to the GTS setup!?!

Either way you'll 'prolly NEVER wipe that silly grin off!

Go for it Patrick - hybrids ok in my book,
Phil
ps. Hey Jim, mebbe we should go get that S afterall?
