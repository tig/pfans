So, you therefore assume that every car maker does it like GM?  Thank
God you're wrong. Although in this case maybe GM got it right after a
few years of "beta testing."

I have driven several cars with DRLs including my VW GTI in which the
running lights, head lights, tail lights, and dash lights are on _all_
the time.  The only difference between DRL-mode and "real" lights is a
slight increase in brightness of the head lights.  It is _very_ easy
to drive at night for a long time with only the DRLs on because the
only indication is the position of the light switch.
