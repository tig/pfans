Has anyone heard of this problem?

In the latest issue of MCN (Motorcycle Consumer News), there was some very
interesting info regarding a rash of water pump failures on the GL1500 Gold
Wing motorcycle.  For those who don't know, the GL1500 has a 6-cylinder,
water-cooled, all-aluminum, boxer motor displacing 1500cc.

After doing some extensive fact finding and owner surveys, MCN found that
indeed the water pumps were failing at a rate significantly higher than those
on other motorcycles.  Further digging uncovered that of the more than 240
pumps which readers had reported as failed, 99% had been filled with
automotive-type coolants, whereas only 1% of the failed pumps had used a
motorcycle-specific coolant such as Hondaline's premixed version.

The silicate additives found in typical automotive coolants, but not present
in Hondaline or other M/C coolants, for example, was alleged to be the reason
that the failures were occurring with the Gold Wing pumps.  Apparently
Honda's pump seal design is particularly sensitive to the abrasive
characteristics of the silicate additives, which are used by more than 95% of
the coolants on the market to prevent/inhibit corrosion in aluminum engines.

It also turns out that people involved in the transportation and heavy
equipment industries have known about this problem (silicates) for several
years, and have generally stayed away from silicate-containing anti-freezes
if at all possible.  

A bulletin put out more than 5 years ago by United Technologies (heavily
involved in the automotive market as an OEM) warned, "This (silicate damage
to coolant seals) is not a problem that might happen to your vehicles.
 Evidence points to the fact that it will happen if you use modern
anti-freeze formulations, and that it is only a matter of time before it does
happen." 

Fleet Equipment magazine notes that the problem is not only widespread, but
that it is aggravated and accelerated by the use of anything other than
purified, deionized water, or by over-concentration of coolant in the system
caused by topping off with pure coolant.

From a book published by Caterpillar entitled "Coolant And Your Engine"...
"In the early 1980s the automotive industry began weight and cost reduction
programs that caused critical aluminum components like blocks and heads to be
exposed to the cooling system.  Due to this change of component material, the
industry develpoed an anti-freeze to protect aluminum components.  This new
anti-freeze resulted in much higher concentrations of dissolved solids than
former anti-freezes.
Unfortunately, these higher concentrations can cause inhibitors to drop out
of solution, and can cause...premature water pump seal leakage or failure due
to precipitates and chemical deposits accumulated on the seal face."

In any case, I had never heard of  this before reading the MCN article, and
it may account for the relatively high failure rate of 944/928 water pumps.
 Why not in other cars?  Well, it may be that Porsche's pump design is
particularly susceptible, just as it seems that the Honda motorcycle pump is
more susceptible to failure than other water-cooled motorcycles.

Regardless of whether or not this is a contributing factor to excessive
Porsche pump failures, I certanily plan on using silicate-free anti-freeze
from now on in my 928.  It may just save me the expense of another water pump
replacement...and we all know how that can hurt you in the wallet.

If anyone else has any info on this subject, please let us know.
