We know about that as well. We get Letterman over here you, know, it's just
6 days old. :^(

If your 25A fuse keeps blowing, the battery is pumping _more_ than 25 Amps
through it. This will be a result of the circuit in question having a lower
resistance than designed to.

In other words, there's probably a short somewhere in the circuit.

=46irst thing to do would be to check that the feed wire to the window isn't
shorting to ground where the connection goes on.
