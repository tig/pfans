I like to extend my thanks to Brian Buxton and the Porsche928 mail list for 
helping me find a car that will (it already has!!) bring plenty of thrills 
and excitement. By listening to you guys, I got enough confidence to let 
Brian take care of everything. Thank you for that.

In regards to Brian, I can only say good things about him. Trying to find a 
car such as a 928 in such a difficult market, one can only value the 
services provided by Brian greatly. Particularly those of us new to 928.

Brian brings car and market knowledge with a twist: trust and honesty. Two 
of the hardest attributes in today's business world. For me that is of key 
importance in transactions of this type. On top of that, he does spend the 
time to educate you, whatever the outcome of the transaction may be. As a 
bonus, he is knowledgable about the 928 (having one of his own), not to 
mention that he loves these cars.

I'm glad that I decided to venture into you mail list even before I was a 
928 owner. And for those of you pasive readers in the background, wandering 
what it is these people are talking about and why they're so in love with 
their machines, you will only begin to appreciate it when you get into a 
928. If you finally decide to purchase one of these babys, don't look 
further; you have one of the best right here with Brian.

Thanks to Brian and everyone else.
