At least they (Daimler) got the V-8 part right. Did the Dart pre-date the
Lotus Elite, which really was a fiberglass car? There are a few of those
still around - no rust problems, anyway.

S'funny, as I was typing that I thought... hmmm... I wonder when the SP250
hit production.  I've always thought it was the first serious British plastic
production car, but Colin was certainly making things that way in the late
'50s.

The Elite, of course, was VERY special - the entire thing, chassis and all,
was tupperware.  Most aspects of it are just right, resulting in a car that,
to me, is perfect.  Perfect, but, like the Dino 246, perfect for other people
to own.  I'll drool over them both but have no desire to see one in my
garage.

===================================================

Gents:

First: Agreed, no Lotus or pre-Fiat Ferrari is worth actually owning.
 Effective self-flagellation and monetary suicide is available for free.

The Price Guide section the U.K. classic car mag published in the USA as
"Thoroughbred & Classic Cars" lists the "from-to" production dates of all
major models.  The Lotus Elite is listed as 1958-63, and the Daimler SP250
sports V8 is listed as 1959-64.  Various articles on the Daimler in this and
other U.K. classic car mags note numerous rust problems excluding, of course,
the bodywork.  Jensen's first, glass-fiber- bodied Interceptor was produced
at least before 1953.

I hope that when the bright-boy engineers who are now actually being allowed,
even encouraged, to design good cars (the accountants now realizing that
"good" is not the antithesis or "cheap to build" or "profitable"), get their
CAD systems wired to real-world vibration analysis models, that we will see
more pure polymer structures like the Lotus Elite.  Please see the December
'97 issue of the USA's "Automobile Magazine" (a not too bad US adaptation of
the U.K.'s superb "Car"), pages 32-33, for a brief article on the Chrysler
CCV "composite concept vehicle."  This rather handsome minimalist 4-door,
which is a clever cross between the Citroen 2CV and Nissan's cute S-Cargo,
was originally designed as Chrysler's entry into China's competition for a
cheap peoples' car for local production.  With a little bit of aluminum
honeycomb sandwich between the inner- and outer-body sections serving as
 structural reinforcement, printed circuit electrical conductors and sound
deadening, this method could produce a truly light and cheap car.

It doesn't take a Lotus lover to fantasize about the steering feel and
precision of non-assisted steering on a sub-1,800 pound car that could stick
like a leach on 165-to-185 tires, nor the acceleration or braking performance
that such light weight and good power-to-weight ratios (say, 10-to-12 #/hp)
would deliver!

Being a wide-body design myself, I must say that the Lotus Elan +2 is a
better fit than the gorgeous Elite.  Who today, in their right mind, would
buy a corpulent Boxter, Z3 or SLK when such a creature as the Lotus Elise
treads the roads???

Great, simple, reliable, inexpensive high-performance cars are coming, and
they're going to be great!  (Just don't hold your breath that they'll come
from Porsche.)
