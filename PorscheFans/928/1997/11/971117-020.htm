Well, let's just say that my weekend was "eventful."  I delivered the
Ferrari TR to my customer and took the long fabled 89 928 GT in on
trade.  Everything fine so far.  Well, on the way out of Cincinnati a
semi-truck decided to shred it's tire, which I promptly ran over, which
punctured a hole in my radiator.  I wasn't pleased.  I was able to make
it to Louisville via frequent stops to fill the overfill tank and took
the car to Stein Automotive (where I found out the bad news).  The car
was flatbedded here to Evansville and I now need to locate a new
radiator.  Anyway, I think that I will kep this car for myself, which
means that my 87 is for sale.  I am asking a little morethan market
value for an 87, but I DEFY anyone to find a better example of an 87
S4.  EVERYTHING on the car works, all the service has been done and I
have every record from day 1 including the window sticker.  It's
black/black, an auto, and has every option except heated seats.  Anyway,
I am tired and hungry so I am going to go eat and shower and get my
mail.
Later,
Brian Buxton
