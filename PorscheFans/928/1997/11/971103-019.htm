It seems to be a good idea not to drop the clutch from rest on a revved-up
engine. Apart from that, if I'm in a real hurry, I'll rev up to 3000 or so
and ease the clutch in, then stomp. This dependably produces the yo-yo
effect (cars whizzing past on highway quickly stop, then whiz backwards)
without any ill effect to the drivetrain. With the tall (2.20 final drive)
gearing on my car, 2nd gets me to 80 mph, which available power causes to
come up pleasantly soon (stated another way, WOW!). These are strong cars
and are meant to be driven.
