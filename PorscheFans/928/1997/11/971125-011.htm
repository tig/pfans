Isn't it great to drive a car that can be so elegant and refined, all the   
while knowing that if you choose, you can leave ribbons on the asphalt.   
At local autocrosses my PCA friends delight in watching me do burnouts at   
the start/finish line, but are truly amazed when I light the back tires   
when rolling along at 20-30 mph. And even with these colorful escapades   
my times are not significantly slower than the 911 drivers'. By the way,   
at our local events, there are several 944 drivers that are untouchable,   
much to the chagrin of the purists.

The best part of getting together w/ our 911 and 944 cousins is driving   
to distant locales on the backroads which make rural Oklahoma so great   
for owning a P-car. It never fails, upon arrival someone will tell me   
they had no idea of the 928 performance. I once passed a C4 at about 130   
and he told me later the roar of the V8 was fantastic. I'm not sure which   
was better, that he could hear it over his own car or that I was still in   
passing gear and accelerating hard.

Have a great Thanksgiving everyone!
