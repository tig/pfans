Michael,

  How worn and how old are your tires?  If there was an odd wear pattern
  on the tires, a factory spec alignment may no longer permit the tires
  to create a contact patch that would compensate for uneven wear.
  
  I've also found that my 928 becomes extremely darty when the front tires
  get hard (regardless of tread wear).  In all but one instance, I've been
  able to replace the front tires and the handling has returned to normal.
  In that one instance, the alignment shop hadn't properly torqued the 
  eccentrics and my "alignment" went away after 25 miles;  you're not noticing 
  small chunks of rubber behind the front fender, are you?
