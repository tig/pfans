Actually, here in the states, there are many of them (geographically
challenged, that is!).  My sister didn't know that New Mexico was a state,
and neither did a telephone ticket salesperson for the Olympics.  When the
man calling from NM couldn't convince her, he talked to her supervisor, who
also insisted that tickets from Atlanta couldn't be sent out of the
country.  Finally, the supervisor above him knew that New Mexico really was
a state.  It is really bad sometimes.  I bet 50%+ of Americans couldn't
name all 50 states and couldn't point out most of them with a map!!!  Let
alone international geography.
