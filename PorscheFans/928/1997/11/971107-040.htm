I need help with my 1983 928 Euro. I had the inst. pod cover taken off and
the ignition/ starter switch was taken off. I removed the cover but the wires
all jumped out of there places. I looked in the manuals wire diagrams but
don't see all of the wires I have in the diagrams. I thought that everything
was alright but I just connected the radio to see if it was working and when
I connected it the antenna went up but I didn't have any power on? (the
starter switch was in when I did this). After I put the power on the radio
wasen't working? I will get the which wires I have in there but I have to
remove the pod cover agian,:-(   Any help would help...
