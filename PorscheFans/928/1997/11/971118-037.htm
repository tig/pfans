AHA!  Once again you have expanded my knowledgebase.  I was having a
hard time finding why the ABS still worked given my aftermarket rims!  I
think I will have fun at the next brake service.  And while we're on the
subject of brakes, any opinions on stainless lines as advertised by
(gasp) GPR or the others?  Unknown whether they are of the DOT variety. 
Also have heard arguments that unless the stock lines were old one would
not feel any change in pedal pressure (not borne out by my previous
experiences where SS lines tremendously firmed up the pedal like a
rock).

I will leave my rear proportioning valve alone since rainy season is
here and I really don't want to activate ABS with every stop, all too
easy especially with these 'Dunlopes'.  The plan thus far is to install
the SS lines, maybe drilled rear rotors, check pads (natch) and then
flush/refill (again) with ATE Super Blue (new!).
