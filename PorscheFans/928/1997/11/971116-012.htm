Hi all! 
This is my first posting to the list!

	My question to anyone who knows is regarding the option codes. I was
delighted to see a list of them on Phil's page, and promptly checked mine
out. The problem I am having is that I have a code that is not on the list;
this is the code "C36". It is the very first code to appear in front of all
the other ones. Does everyone have this code? Does it mean anything?
	My car is an '87 S4, number 2194. I recently e-mailed Phil, asking him to
give me more info on the widebody "battlestar", and he told me where I
could get the kit. He also suggested a look I prefer to that one; that
being in the 928 International gallery. The red widebody totally blew me
away, and I am happy to say that as soon as I saw it, I called 928
International. They stated that it was not a kit, and was hand fabricated
out of steel, taking numerous hours to complete. I instantly called my
buddy (who just happens to own a customizing body shop) and booked my car
in! I have taken the leap! I am getting that exact look (he drooled over
the picture too) for about $3500.00 Canadian. The car will soon be sporting
315/35 ZR17s on the rears! It is already chipped out, has a free flow
exhaust, and a K&N Filtercharger. I expect suspension and more agressive
engine mods upcoming this spring.
	I'll be sure to e-mail pictures when it's done. It will take a while,
because he is doing it in his spare time (hence the low cost), but I don't
care because winter has just started here in Edmonton, Alberta, and I won't
be able to drive it until March anyway.

'87 S4, soon to look damned nasty!
