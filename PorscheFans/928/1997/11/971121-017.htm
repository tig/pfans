Hee Hee, yes I was just kidding about the deer whistle!

Don't know about it's effectiveness although I do recall some tv show
test where they showed that deer did seem to raise their heads in
awareness of cars so equipped.  Noise maker?  Hell, that's what a good
Porsche V8 is for!  Bring on the Borlas!

As far as elevated speeds at night, that's why you need upgraded
lighting, the right car, the right road, and above all a competent
driver at the wheel.

We don't need no stinkin' whistles,
Phil Tong
