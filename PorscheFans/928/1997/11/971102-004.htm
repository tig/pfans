For all you nice folks out there who may have the occasional bad habit like
me (nice clear road just begging for a solid solo ), there is an
organization called RADAR which is looking out for our rights on the roads.
 "A Monthly Newsletter about Radar, Radar Detectors and Transportation
Issues", when you subscribe they send you a handbook about the issues
including how to prepare yourself for court and what line of defense to
use.  Moreover, they report on current cases of motorists beating laser and
regular radar tickets in court.  They are also affiliated with the Safety
Warning System (this is what sets off your radar detector alerting you that
there are dangerous conditions ahead or an accident - this really works). 
I am not sure if they have a web site yet, there land coordinates are 4949
South 25A, Tipp City, Ohio 45371.  Phone (937) 667-5472 Fax (937) 667-3418
- if interested, I suggest you call an request a sample newsletter (it`s
usually free)

"state" troopers looking for me)
