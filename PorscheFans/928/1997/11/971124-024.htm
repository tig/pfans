 There's a little pin on the top 
of the cast aluminum piece right over the tumbler. Maybe I drive this pin
down and the tumbler assy comes out? I don't know, so I try it. Nope. The
tumbler still won't come out. I try to get the whole cast aluminum out,
but I can't (someone is about to answer that mystery for me, right?). So,
I give up for the time being and put the steering wheel back on so that I
can simply move the car out of the middle of the garage for the night. I
start it up and start to back out and turn the wheel and 

CLICK!

It locks! Oh, no...no...don't do this to me!

So I put the old key in the tumbler and _work_ it for about 3 minutes and
it finally turns the tumbler. Yah hoo! Wow...now the door buzzer works to.
But I can't take the key out. I did and got myself back into the locked
problem and it took another 3 minutes of panic to get the tumbler to turn
again.

The column needs to be re-keyed. How does it come out?


I took a flat file and and filed away the aluminum around the perimeter of the pin until I exposed about 1 mm of the top.  Then I took a 
plier and pulled the pin out.  That's all it took! .. about 10 minutes.
