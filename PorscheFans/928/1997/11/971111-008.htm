Doesnt the police attitude change from State to State. Would living in a
small town help, if you could get to know the people that wrote the
tickets?

WHere I live, I'm a good 30 minutes (928 speed) from the nearest police
station. We see the Police out here twice a year (during holiday seasons).
I don't even _bother_ switching on my radar jammer until I'm well away from
home.

Off to the southern coasts goes I.

My current car is a nice bland "blend in with the traffic" colour. If I
went to the US, I'd probably go for a nice subdued metallic deep green.

So Texas it is. What are the beaches like there? :^)

You guessed right. I don't even _know_ anyone over here that can afford a
T1. Our local ISP, serving over 200 clients as well as a high school, has a
64k link. Telecoms is _Hellishly_ expensive over here, and one of the
primary reasons for me wanting to get out until it's fixed.

Didn't think of that.

Depends. What exactly do you want autographed? If it's your girlfriend,
then Yes!

>>Would this need to be taken into account in choosing a location?

OK. It's just that every US road trip movie I have watched has the people
being put in jail for "wearing an offensive colour prior to 4pm" while
travelling through Alabama.

That's the way it was (and still is) being spelt in the famous repeating post.
So you'll have to make do with the apostrophes.
