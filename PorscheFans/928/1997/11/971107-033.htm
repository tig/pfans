Regarding the "misinformation"...whoever said that locked up rear brakes will
spin the car is correct, while whoever said locking up the fronts will spin
the car is not.

Fundamental fact...tires which are locked up will NOT "steer" in any
direction.  They will continue to travel (slide) in the direction the vehicle
was moving at the time of lock-up.  No matter what you do with the steering
wheel, the locked tires will continue to travel in a straight line as
determined at the time of lockup.

So, if your car is going absolutely dead straight forward at rear lockup
time, you will not spin....but that's a big IF.  The slightest movement of
the steering wheel will begin turning the car at the front, and at that point
the rear tires (which are still sliding straight ahead) will start bringing
the tail around.  If the front tires are locked instead, you have absolutely
no directional control of the front end and the car will track straight on
done the road (or off the road if you're in the middle of a curve) - no way
to induce a spin.

This is demonstrated on motorcycles all the time - lock the rear and you'd
best be pointing perfectly straight ahead otherwise the back end will pass
you in a big hurry. This is taught in m/c education classes;  you've got to
be on your toes to keep the back end under control while you come to a stop.
 However, if you lock up the front, you're are going down because you've lost
all ability to steer - you don't spin, you just crash in a heap going
straight ahead.  Experts can recover from a momentary locked front wheel
without crashing, but these guys are racers, not your ordinary street rider.

Furthermore, a standard emergency maneuver taught in evasive driving classes
is the classic 180 degree turn initiated using the emergency (parking) brake.
 Nail the emergency brake (momentarily) while pushing in the clutch to allow
the rear wheels to lock (and keep the engine running), and yank the wheel
hard left - instant spin.  If your're good at it, you can halt the spin after
180 degrees and now you're going in the opposite direction - bye bye bad
guys.
