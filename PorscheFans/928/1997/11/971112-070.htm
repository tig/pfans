Man Paul,  this is a horrible story!

If I were in your shoes I would contact any friend who's an attorney 
and discuss this with them.  Here's what I've learned from my 
associates regarding situations such as yours:

Contact your State Attorney General's Office and/or your Governor's 
Office immediately and file a formal complaint against this officer. 
 I would also file a formal request with that police department for 
specific information regarding what data the officer had to treat you 
like a dangerous suspect (FYI, jacking someone on their hood is not 
standard procedure for misdemeanor traffic violations).  You might 
also want to request information from that department on any past 
complaints that may have been filed against this officer.  Contact 
your Governor's Office and ask how the "Freedom of Information Act" is 
carried out in your area.  Also keep in mind that *ANY* information 
the Police and the Prosecuting Attorney's office has on this case is 
subject to your review (otherwise, how would you mount a defense?)

His threat to tow your car and then search it at the impound lot was 
an idle one (you still have to have probable cause to search a vehicle 
regardless of its location). Also, his threat to "tear up your 
interior" was an attempt to put you under duress which is a violation 
of your civil rights and jacking you on the hood of your car with out 
a good reason is assault!  However, you did do the right thing in 
allowing him to search it, thus avoiding a trip to jail (remember, in 
most cases they can hold you up to 3 days and then they *HAVE* to 
charge you or release you).  However, if you had the time to spend, a 
bit of jail time is not so bad.  In certain circumstances, it can be 
used as a bargaining chip to get your traffic ticket(s) dismissed or 
adjudicated to "Time Served".   This is OK if you have more time than 
money but otherwise not very appealing.  It can also be used to build 
a illegal detainment case.

Needless to say, this whole situation stinks.  If I was in your shoes 
I would definitely file formal complaints against this person and 
attempt to get him disciplined.  I would also *SERIOUSLY* consider 
taking him and his department to civil court.  You'd be surprised how 
a relatively small $100,000 law suit for even the slightest 
circumstance of police harassment, assault or a civil rights violation 
will get that department's attention *PRONTO*.  Many times, all you 
need to do is file the case and a department will move immediately to 
investigate it and settle it; shelving the officer to a desk job 
during the process.  Also, if your not afraid of having your name in 
the papers, the media will often times follow situations like this if 
the police department has a reputation for being "overly ambitions" in 
their enforcement of traffic statutes.

Do I sound adamant about situations like yours?  Well, I am!  Being a 
Hispanic in Texas with a penchant for driving late model European cars 
doesn't always sit well during traffic stops.  After suffering a 
couple of similar situations, I've learned (with the help of attorney 
friends) how to "take back" control of a police encounter and ensure 
they stick to very strict procedures.  I am *ALWAYS EXTREEMLY POLITE, 
even friendly but JUST AS PERSITANT* that they follow the rules and 
fully disclose the details of the situation.  In a few circumstances, 
I've *POLITELY but FIRMLY* (read: constant direct eye contact) 
informed the officer that I would promptly carry out the details 
listed above if he didn't stick to the rules.  In each of those 
circumstances, they cut me loose with no ticket written (which makes 
you wonder why they even stopped you).

Paul I wish you the best of luck with this case. It is my fondest hope 
that this situation is quickly resolved with justice equally served. 
 Please keep in mind that cases like yours are not as extraordinary as 
you might think.  In this country, it is up to *YOU* to excise  your 
own civil rights!  Sometimes that also means defending them.  To that 
end, never be afraid to use every aspect of our system of government 
that is available to you.

Kindest Personal Regards,

Bert Garcia

Oh boy, today was one of the worst days I've had in a while.
Bad 928 related thing number 1:
I'm walking to my car from my work and I see I pickup truck sliding on 
the wet pavement and SLAM into my parked yellow beauty. It took out 
the rear bumper, BOTH quarter panels, bent the hatch big time (and 
shattered the glass), and the force spun my car around!  I turns out 
it was a 17 year old girl driving, and she wasn't even on her dad's 
insurance plan! So now the $12-15k damage will be paid by them out of 
pocket!
Bad 928 related thing number 2:
I was driving home, pissed off, and generally in a bad mood (see above 
for reason) and was going about 75 in a 50, BUT, I had the car in low 
gear, I think third, and the car was really PURRING @4.5k RPM (you 
know, loud!!, see fluidesign.com/928 for reason why). I get off the 
exit and I notice a cop behind me, when I was at the light on a side 
street. He took the normal 30 or so seconds to run my plate and then 
pulled me over. He immediately told me and my passenger to steop out 
of the car, threw me on my hood, (and scratching my paint!!), and 
searched me and my passenger (a female). He said we were estimated at 
100 mph. He didn't have his radar on, and was at a stop light at an 
intersection with the road I was travelling on when he saw us going 
by.
Now, the high volume of the exhaust, and the condition of my rear 
bumper (destroyed) led him to pull us over. He then wanted to search 
the car (meanwhile, 4!! other cruisers pulled up, Wellesley Cops 
figure, all a bunch of punk motherfuckers who have nothing better to 
do than harass people who work hard to own and drive nice cars), I 
said no he can't, you have no right to, and you have no probable 
cause. He said, "ok smart-ass, how about I tow this thing, throw you 
in jail, and impound the car and tear the interior apart." I couldn't 
believe this guy's attitude. I then let up and said ok, search the 
car, they looked through the whole car, and brought filthy drug 
sniffing dogs in on my new leather to search. Eventually they let me 
go and gave me a $450 citation.
I am sick and tired of being harrassed day in and day out by police 
officers. A citizen should have a right to operate his cars on public 
roadways without being constantly stopped and harassed, physically 
roughed up, and have his property seized and searched.
I work hard to keep up that car, and I'm not a pimp, or a drug dealer, 
or any other kind of criminal, though I am repeatedly treated like 
one.
I am getting rid of the 928, a car I love dearly, and one which I've 
invested much time and money into. I hope I can afford to send it to 
Greece to keep as my car there, but I may be forced to sell it if my 
finances can't deal. I went to a Porsche dealership (I won't be driven 
away from my favorite marque) and picked out a nice Silver/Black 
Boxster, with a STOCK exhaust, that sounds nice yet is quite.
I am very sad that my days of 340+ HP acceleration, rail-like 
cornering, and eye-popping braking are over, not to mention the 
Formula 1 sound, but the Boxster is a nice little car, and the 
Silver/black configuration is subtle, and classy. Not my style, but 
what can I do. I'm only going to be in this country a few more years, 
so I'll make do......
This was a very bad day indeed,

(now, for the Boxster, 18" 3 piece supercup wheels {Mr. Wood, you 
getting this?}, lowering springs, nice stereo, and I'm ready to roll)
