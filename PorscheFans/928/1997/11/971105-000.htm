Ken:

Thanks for the heads-up!  I'll be watching my mailbox.  I love those
sales - last time got I a pair of those German twin-lens mirrors (didn't
want to take the other pair, which I also got from Performance, off the
'84).  Some don't like 'em but I groove on 'em!  They really do cut down
on nighttime glare but even better than that they provide a super wide
viewing angle - perfect if the main point is to know whether another car
is close by or not without having to take your eyes off the road for
long.  Most effective for city combat duty.  I've adjusted them 'just
so' so if a car appears in the outer pane it's not safe to cut over, if
the inner pane then it's gas-and-go time ba-by!

Whups, sorry to rant on, only thing I like better than the 928 is all
the stuff for them!

now I know why I have a hood gap :)
