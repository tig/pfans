  I have the braided steel lines on my car, and although I didn't notice any 
  difference in pedal feel after they were installed, I would still recommend
  them.  While recently debugging a problem with my brakes, I was certainly 
  glad that I had the braided lines since I was able to eliminate them as the 
  possible culprit for a soft pedal; i.e. with braided steel lines, you're 
  essentially running "solid" lines from the master cylinder/pressure regulators 
  all the way down to the calipers.
  
  My problem turned out to be a bad vacuum booster.  I'll be posting the details
  and a FAQ procedure for testing and replacing it when I get a chance.
