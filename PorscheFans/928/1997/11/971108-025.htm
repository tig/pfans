Thanks for helping me get the word out!   The Premiere issues closing date
for submission of material is 11/30/97.  We have some pretty good material on
a few 928's but are looking for more.  We are basically looking for cars that
have been modified to their owners specifications (performance and appearance
upgrades, wheels, wings, who or what company did the work or supplied the
products, etc.) and lots and lots of photos of the car with all necessary
information with which to edit an article.  One of the main request we
recieved when doing our marketing research was to include LOTS of photos.  We
were amazed at the amount of people out there who admitted they only look at
the pictures and not read the articles (disturbing to me), I guess its their
"Porsche Playboy"... 

In addition to looking for cars, if some of the Porsche people you know would
like subscriber cards let me know how I can get them to them.  I would hate
to see any Porschephile miss the Premiere Issue of a new Porsche magazine,
which will be a collector's item.  There 20,000 issues scheduled for
newsstand distribution in late January and we expect them to sell fast as
word of the magazine is spreading like wild fire.

Thanks again,
Jeffrey Cox
