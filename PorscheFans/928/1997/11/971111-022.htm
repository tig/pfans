>I was poised to purchase a 928s4 within weeks.  Most likely, an s4 with about
>50K on it.  however, I test drove an NSX last week and now i can't make up my
>mind.  

Let me help you out with the reliability issue.  I debated between a 928 and 
an NSX myself.  That was until I asked about the maintenence on the NSX.
I asked the dealer how competent they were at fixing the car.  They said they
always have at least one of them in the shop at all times, usually more.  
There are less than ten in this city.  He also said that they usually don't 
spend more than 3 weeks in the shop.  This was to make me feel better.  
I've never had the Porsche in for more than an afternoon.  Even then it has 
always been for routine maintenance.  The NSX is overly complicated and
requires a lot more maintainence.  To do simple work, the engine has to
be dropped to get to the top of it.  The Porsche is much better.

Later...
