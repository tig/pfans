Here are a few possibilities...you decide which best describes you.

1.  You have latent masochistic tendencies.

2.  You'd rather drink beer, send digest e-mail, and look at your car than
actually drive it...928s give the term "hangar queen" a bad name.

3.  You are a closet mechanic and love to solve unfathomable problems foisted
on you by Der evil Dr. Ing. Porsche.

4.  You've decided that social security (or whatever the equivalent is across
either pond) is sufficient for your retirement...so you're going to invest
all your money in a mechanical objet d'art.

5.  You couldn't afford a "real" Porsche, and used 928s are cheap to buy (too
bad they aren't cheap to run).....$1000 for a piece of cloth with some metal
rods and bungee cords...unbelievable!

6.  You were looking for an economical car....928s spend a lot of time in the
garage (hence minimal fuel consumption), parts are way too expensive (so you
can't fix it anyway), so you take it off the road for the "winter"... bet you
didn't think that winter would last 10 months, did you?

7.  You bought it because it's one of the few cars worth a whole lot more as
parts than as an actual running vehicle.

8.  Misery loves company...so you tell EVERYONE you meet how great these cars
are....and they're CHEAP!

9.  It's fun to drive

10.  Couldn't think of any more...so what's your story?
