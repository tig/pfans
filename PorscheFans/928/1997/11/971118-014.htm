Update:

Maiden voyage was last night. Backed out of the driveway, went down to the
end of the block shifting through second gear, did a big U-turn, came back 
towards the house, gently blipped the gas pedal (quick 1600 to 2200 RPM)
and the car jumped! Neck snapping torque. I haven't even run it above 2400
RPM yet and have quite a bit of easy-mileage break-in to do before I can even
experience the feel of the vacuum secondaries kicking in. Sure doesn't sound
like a Porsche anymore. Way too much lope in the cam. I'm psyched! It's a
monster.

I went through reverse, 1st, 2nd and 3rd and all seems well with the tranny.
(Knock on wood). I have to replace the intake manifold gaskets as they are
leaking oil behind the distributer. The 3M High Temp gasket sealer uhmm...
didn't. 8-(  I'll be changing the oil and filters now that the rings are
seated.

I need a power steering hose. The old supply line is spewing oil at the middle
crimp. Any ideas where I can get one? I'll be trying Mark Anderson at 928
International. Other suggestions?
