I thought of something else. Check the wiring and stuff for the outside =

rearview mirrors. They are heated. And their heater is part of the rear =

window defroster circuit.

If you are instantly blowing fuses, you can find the power wires for =

the mirror's heaters and disconnect. If you still blow fuses then its =

the rear window. Reconnect the mirrors until you solve the rear window =

problem.

If you don't have much current flowing and are not blowing fuses on =

demand, try wiggling the mirrors and see if you blow a fuse then (with =

the defroster engaged). If so, its in the wiring to the mirror that =

you wiggled.

The human mind ordinarily operates at only ten percent of its
capacity -- the rest is overhead for the operating system.
