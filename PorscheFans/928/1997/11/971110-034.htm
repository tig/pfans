Dear Brian:

As someone that cares, I think you need to get your "need for speed" at a
track. I certainly get a thrill when traveling at the speeds a 928 was
designed to do. However, the Interstate is also used by lesser cars and
drivers. High speed travel on public roads creates a potential hazard for
you all those in your way. As much of a thrill that speeding may be, as a
driver you must also consider the potential risk you are to the public.

However, on the track you can indulge your "need for speed" in relative
saftey without placing unsuspecting commuters at risk. Since you live in
Williamsburg VA, you are only a few hours from several good tracks. I'm sure
your PCA region utilizes one or more of them for driver's ed throughout the
year. Also, my region "Potomac" uses Summit Point, WV five times a year. You
and all other PCA members are invited to participate in our well run,
educational, safe, and loads of fun events.

I would rather have you in attendance at the next "Frenzy" than read about
or see some "hot shot" in a 928 in amazing car chases on "Cops".

Happy, safe motoring. Ed
