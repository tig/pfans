A man was driving home late one afternoon, and he was driving
above the speed limit. He notices a police car with its red lights on
in his rear view mirror. He thinks "I can outrun this guy," so he
floors it and the race is on. 

The cars are racing down the highway -- 60, 70, 80, 90 miles and
hour.

Finally, as his speedometer passes 100, the guy figures "what the
heck," and gives up. He pulls over to the curb. The police officer
gets out of his cruiser and approaches the car. He leans down and
says "listen mister, I've had a really lousy day, and I just want to go
home. Give me a good excuse and I'll let you go." 

The man thought for a moment and said..."Three weeks ago, my
wife ran off with a police officer. When I saw your cruiser in my rear
view mirror, I thought you were that officer and you were trying to
give her back to me!" 

The Officer had no choice, he let him go!
