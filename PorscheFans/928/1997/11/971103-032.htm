That numerically low rear axle ratio really just means that the shift
points are at different speeds, which may or may not be an advantage
(well, it also means that it's a little slow off the line, but I'm
not into drag racing). For instance, in turn 6-7 at NHIS, I can pass
the apex at a bit over 3000 rpm in 2nd, and upshift at 6400 just as
I straighten out for turn 8. With a different axle ratio, the
choices would be to lug out of the apex, or go slower so I could
shift while still in turn 7. So the overall ratio is just right for
that particular spot. But somewhere else, I have to upshift, or just
feather the throttle, about 100 feet before downshifting again, so
the ratio is just wrong there. And the right and wrong spots have
changed as I've gotten faster, and with any luck will continue to
do so.

I will admit, though, that I never expect to find any use for fifth
gear on the track. The killer there is the big gap between fourth
and fifth in the U.S. gearboxes. The 1-2-3-4 gaps are the same in
U.S. and Euro versions, at least for the model year closest to my
heart.
