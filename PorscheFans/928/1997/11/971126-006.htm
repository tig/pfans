Paul:

My universal and so far successful response in these situations is to remind
the adjuster that they have an obligation to repair or replace the car.  It
is --your-- option to take cash instead of repair or replacement.

It's also up to you to document the value of the car.  Do your research and
get comparable values for recent sales to back up your claim.  This list is
a great place to get documented proof of the replacement value.  You have
been religiously documenting the history and the expenses to get your car
where it is now, minus the crash damage.  Take all that stuff with you, and
show the adjusters that the Euro model is worth 50 to 100%  --more-- than
the comparable US model in those years.  Remind them that you have to pay
retail for a replacement, not the NADA wholesale value they offer.

Collision and comprehensive coverage on these cars is sky high.  Why?
Because replacement parts are sky high, and the value of the cars varies so
much depending on condition.  But we (you and me and others) have been
faithfully paying the high premiums against the day when the drunk babe
kisses the car too hard with teeth instead of tongue. 

The problem and blame belong primarily to the other party's insurance.  She
did have coverage, right?  The balance of the blame here belongs to your
insurance carrier, who should be defending your rights.  After all,  they
are the ones collecting your premiums, right?  Many companies will negotiate
a settlement for you, one that involves the minimum hassle and inconvenience
to the carriers without regard to the insured.

If your carrier is not defending you adequately or negotiating in your best
interests,  you can usually get their immediate attention by threatening to
engage outside counsel.  Any costs will be added to the settlement if you
have a good attorney, so this is a painless route for you, and they know it.
Don't be shy about this.  Establish your positive position early.
Professional services like legal support are a bargain in the long run.



I don't ever promote action that defrauds insurance companies.  I don't
promote actions that defraud the insured either.  Remind your agent that the
golden rule applies here, and suggest that they accept a 50% reduction in
premiums since your Euro car is worth that much less.  When he/she stops
laughing,  have them cut a reasonable check.


Best of luck on this.  And please let us know how well you do.  If it
doesn't work out,  BE SURE to post the name of the insurance company to make
sure the rest of us don't fall in the same trap.
