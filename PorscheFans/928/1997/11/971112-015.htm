I'm another person that was planning to get an NSX and ended up with a 928.

Several reasons, really - but one big one is price.  For under $16k I got
myself a '87 S4 5-sp (thanks again, Brian).  The only NSX I've seen for
sale in that price range was rolled and being sold for parts.  Until 
recently,
It was hard to find an NSX for under $40K.  Over the past year or so, 
prices
have started to come down - but you're still going to pay twice as much, 
and
for what?

Better reliability?  OK, probably yes.  The NSX was named the 1996 J.D. 
Power
"most dependable car at five years of ownership" - tied w/Lexus LS400.  
Part
of that dependability may be related to the low miles on the cars - is it
just me or does it seem like most NSX owners don't actually drive their 
cars?
As you may notice reading this list, people who own 928s drive them.

My personal experience with 4 Porsches (all water cooled) and 6 
Hondas/Acuras
over the last 20 years says the NSX probably will be more reliable, but if
reliablity is your main concern, you probably shouldn't be considering 
either
the NSX or the 928.

In spite of similar performance, these are very different cars.  
Personally,
I find the 928 - especially with the 5 speed - a bit of a pain to drive in
city traffic.  The NSX is a much lighter and more manuverable car at low
speeds...but that's not what you want this car for, is it?

Away from traffic lights, both cars are excellent.  For short trips the NSX
will delight.  Any serious driving demands the 928.  When I bought my car I
drove it back from DC to Ann Arbor - 600 miles altogether - and when I got
home I was ready to jump back in the car and go somewhere else.

My advice is to buy the 928.  A year from now if you still want the NSX
you'll probably be able to find one for less than you'd spend today, and
your 928 should be worth pretty much what it is now - maybe even a little
more.  And if you invest the $15K difference in price wisely, in a few 
years
you might find you can have the NSX, too!
