I just received my EXCELLENCE mag. and read the article on the devek
928...what a hot car!  I was discussing the car with a co worker ( porsche
mech and race car driver) he says there is no way a 928 could do 200mph.
 does anybody know what this car has actually done for top speed?  Maybe we
need a trip to the salt flats?

For the 928 fans in Dallas, I got a hold of a Dallas newspaper and found that
it is a hot german car market!  there were many 928s advertised with very
good prices and 5spds in 85 and later models.

At the shop I work at part time I had the privlege of driving an 89 928 US
model 5spd
across the parking lot. The first thing I noticed was this car seemed much
lighter in the controls (steering and clutch) and didnt seem very snappy
right off idle compared to my 86 928s US model.  Is this just my imagination
or are these systems actually different enough to change their feel.
thanks 
Glenn
