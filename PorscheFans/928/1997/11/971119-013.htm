Well, I am back.  Never really left but work and car problem have
prevented me to participate to the forum.

I have a problem.  2 weeks ago, I go to start the beast and it
just won't work.  First thought, my fuel pump is dead (it was 
noisy for a while so I ASSUMED it was the problem.)

Put a good used fuel pump on and IT WONT START...  Well, checked
that the pump was getting power to it, check the relay and the fuse
then did the pump volume test (break open the return line to the 
tank and measure volume).  The new pump is OK, so is the old
one (I put it back in, no reason to change something that works).

I tried to start the car again, it almost did.  Charged the battery
to get a little bit more juice to the starter and the thing started.

However, it now looks like I am running way too rich.  The good thing
is that I do not need to deactivate my brake light to avoid being
spotted by the cop, I have a cloud of smoke coming out of the exaust
(grey smoke, not blue at all so I assume no ail leak, and not white
so not a coolant leak).  I say that the mixture is rich because my
catalysts appeard to have heated pretty good after a 5 minutes drive.

Anyway, does anyone have an idea on this one?

Also, I would like to put an idiot's guide on troubleshooting a car
that does not start on the FAQ.  I shure would need it and it would
be nice to know some of peoples tricks...

Just a thought and a big question...

TIA
