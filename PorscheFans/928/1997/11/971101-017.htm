Yikes-ola!!  In my neck of the woods this, unless Perfectly Executed,
raises the stakes from speeding, to evading an officer....  remember our
uniqueness.  Do you think that Gendarme' (sp) actually would look at the
oncoming traffic and say to himself  "Hey, look at that 928, that's
_exactly_ like the one I clocked.... but it was going the other way,
must not be the same car."  Sorry to be brusque, but being arrested and
handcuffed outside your car is the pits...  :|

Hi everyone, I have a problem with my inst. warning lights. I just changed the
back wiring (the blue part) of the inst. cluster and 3 warning lights still
arent working. It's not the bulbs because I switched them and they are all
working. When I switch the right bunch of connectors with the middle one I see
the 'ABS' light come on, but I put them back and I get nothing. The lights
that don't come on during the 'bulb check' are the Oil level light, OXS light
and the ABS light. If anyone could shed some light on the situation I would
appreaciate it greatly. Thanks in advance.
