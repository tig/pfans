Mikel-
I think that this would be a pretty good idea if it weren't for two
things:
1) Insurance is bad enough on Ferrari's, Lambo's, Porsche's, etc when
the owner of the car is driving them ... and insurance co would love to
see me walk in there trying to insure the cars for who knows who to
drive them.

2) Whenever who knows who comes to drive our cars you know they will be
royally thrashing them ... after all ... they give them back after a few
hours.  Most people would not have the financial resources or the
willingness to spend them by "renting" a sports car.

But I'm game if you are.  Where will these cars be stored?  My house?
