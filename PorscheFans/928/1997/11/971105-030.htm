these are sport seats?

LOL - just joking!  The repeating msg. bug is back!?! Deja Vu!

*****

Speaking of seats, I had the pleasure of working alongside Lucky
tonight.  We explored the inner workings of these Recaro seats and made
some pretty interesting discoveries (possible challenge #3 but really
too tough/obscure fortunately for all!). My main point is that he's got
to be one of the most diehard 928 fans on the planet!  Probably
tinkering right now.  Lucky works very carefully and methodically,
contemplating all options while keeping safety (of the car & it's
occupants) at the forefront.  

Know what else?  I thought I was nuts about this 928 club but I bet he
hasn't taken his club t-shirt off since arriving!  I wish I had a camera
to snap a photo of him in the shop, surrounded by a school of landsharks
that he was working on (almost at the same time!) - call him the
sharktamer as he was definately in his element!

Thanks to Lucky, I now christen the GT with it's racecar name, "Big
Blue"...  

"Cheers" to all you 928 fans & 928s...
Here's to the '98 Race Season & 928 victories!
