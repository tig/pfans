I spent about twenty years in the insurance industry as an agent, agency
owner and broker, and would prefer to forget about the whole business.  BUT

Reading about some of the losses, and the settlement offers made by
adjusters has finally gotten to me, and I thought I would add a comment or two.

Clearly, the purpose and form of the physical damage insurance policy is
misunderstood by most policyholders.  In my more cynical moods, I would
suggest that most insurance agents don't know what an insurance policy is or
is supposed to do, which is why most policyholders are in the dark to begin
with.

Basically, the purpose of insurance is to make a loss of value sustained
from an insured peril, whole.

Of course adjusters want to make the best settlement for their company
possible, under the terms of the policy.  Valuation of the loss is the one
negotiation point, and there are some ground rules that must be understood
before anyone can be satisfied.

With regard to automobiles, the one plain fact that ALWAYS exists, is that
automobiles depreciate.  Very few vehicles appreciate here, even in
antiquity, and if they are of special value and interest, then they will
probably not be insured under a standard personal auto policy.  

In the case of the Euro 928 with all the trick gizzies that is worth at
least "$17,000"....from an insurance policy adjuster's point of view:
unlikely.  The "Book" value is X dollars.   The collision damage portion of
the policy probably says that the company will repair or replace and the
coverage is for the ACV less a certain deductible.  ACV means ACTUAL CASH
VALUE, and that means just exactly that:  The ACTUAL CASH VALUE of the
vehicle at the time of loss.  If value in excess of the "book value" (NADA
"Blue Book", etc), can be proved, then the amount of loss will exceed that
"book value", and the settlement will be higher.

A neighbor of mine (not my insured), had a fire in his VW van.  "Book Value"
was $300.  But my neighbor had completely rebuild his van, including engine
and transaxle and most of the interior.  He had paid $300 for the van prior
to the work, but had put more than $1300 into parts alone, and he had the
receipts to prove it.  At my suggestion, he went to the local VW dealer, the
local Ford Dealer and one more.  He showed them pictures of the van before
the fire,a dn explained what he had had done within the past few months.
All the dealers said that without seeing the vehicle it was difficult to
give a firm value, but given the documentation of my neighbor and the
picture, all three dealers said that they would sell the vehicle on their
lots for between $1100 and $1800.  

Therefore, the local market established the ACTUAL CASH VALUE of my neibors
loss, and the settlement was $1300.

Thus, if it can be established that one 928 is worth twice the normal, book
value of a 928 of the same year and mileage, then that is what the
settlement will be.

Now, if the loss is under the property damage portion of someone else's
policy...that is, They hit You, then someof the rules change.  If you used
the car for commuting, and the accident was clearly the fault of the other
party, then, I am sure, the other insurance company will be happy for you to
rent a car.

BUT:  ACTUAL CASH VALUE is STILL actual cash value.  Period.  That is what
the policy states,a nd that is the basis of the settlement of loss.

Hire a lawyer?  I doubt that it would do any good in an automobile phisical
damage loss, unless there was some question of whether or not the damage was
deliberately caused.  Insurance policies are legal contracts.  They
stipulate what will be done under what circumstances and who will be
responsible for what actions after the loss.  And Actual Cash Value is what
any insurance company will be on the hook for, period.

It might be well to have our 928s appraised periodically, so that a baseline
valuation can be documented in case of loss.  But I do not believe that
"stated amount" policies are wise for automobiles.  By buying, say, $17,000
of stated value coverage, doesn't mean that that is what is paid in a total
loss.  Generally, in a stated amount policy, the value stated is just
themost that can be paid at time of loss, and the value of the
destroyed/damaged vehicle must be established at time of loss, and thus, we
really come back to ACV.

I also agree that some companies are much better to do business with than
others. Certainly, the direct writers are usually less flexible in settling
claims than are companies with independent agency representation.  The
weakness there is that most independent agencies aren't very good at doing
what they do, and unless there is a technician in the office who really
knows what she is doing, the average insured is not well taken care of,a nd
won't know the difference until the catastrophe occurs.

I have run on long enough, but I will add just this:  insurance should NEVER
be sold; rather it should be BOUGHT by the policyholder.  Think about that:
the role of the agent should be to educate his policyholder about his risks,
and the methods available to protect his values against loss.  Then armed
with that information, the insured makes a purchasing decision NOT based on
premium, but on the value of the protection that he now understand that he
is purchasing.

Find an agent that will take the time to educate you in his business, and
you will find a "keeper" and also, probably, an agent who will help you
settle your claim and get the full value of loss made whole.  Agent's like
that are few and far between, as most would rather play golf or attend
Rotary meetings.

I hope that most of our sharks never need to have the policy work for them,
but if worse comes to worse, hopefully, you will have bought what you need,
and understand what it is.

Now back to retirement.

Roger
