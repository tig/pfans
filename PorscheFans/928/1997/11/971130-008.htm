junker)

Sorry to hear that as they seem to normally be pretty good (I live 
about 30 minutes away) and have talked to them before, as well as 
knowing several people who have bought there.  There is a guy in NC 
that only goes to them to buy his 928s (though I don't know what he's 
buying now) and he had bought a large number there.  I could probably 
have went over and looked it over for you without you having to fly 
down, but alas, we hadn't communicated about this prior.
