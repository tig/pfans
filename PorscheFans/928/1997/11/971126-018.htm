Kurt,
Howdy.... doing ok?.....hope so.
Per your advice to re-bleed, I did last night. Had a big scare though.....the
EZ Bleed pressurizes the system as it fills the reservoir, (uses tire air)
but anyway there was fluid leakage from the bottom of the master cylinder. I
thought oh my God, what have I done? I thought maybe the master cylinder had
become unseated due to the pressurization, or I busted the feeder hose from
the reservoir to the clutch master cylinder. Turned out to be leaking from
the feeder hose connection to the reservoir.
It's just pushed onto the reservoir nipple. (Is it ok to say "nipple" in this
forum?) :)
Anyway, I put a hose clamp on it and all is well. 
Question.....Was there suppose to be a hose clamp on there from the factory? 
I thought about changing the hose, but boy, that looked like it would be a
major hassle as I couldn't even see the connection at the clutch master
cylinder, much less the clutch master cylinder itself. The manuals don't have
 2 words to say about the clutch master. (or at least I couldn't find it)  
Anyway, just got back from brake evaluation, the second part of it being to
remove the ABS relay and perform tests as before. Now the rear brakes lock
more readily and the rear skid marks start in the middle of the front brake
skid marks. 
(for example front mark = 6'  /  rear mark = 3')  Pretty darn even braking
now, with slight front brake bias.
Apparently, there was still a little air in the rear lines. (Although I
didn't really see any air come from any of the total of 10 fittings ---- 8
wheel + 1 master cyl. + 1 clutch)
So the re-bleed tip was good advice. Thanks!
(Oh, I did pump the brake pedal and clutch pedal (per the manual) while
bleeding.)
So now I have near equal braking and and can let the ABS take care of the
small stuff!
Bought the spanner wrench for the height adjusters today. (getting the front
off the bottom of the spec)
Regards to all,
Greg Schickel
