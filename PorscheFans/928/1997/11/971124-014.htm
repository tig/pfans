Thanks to everybody that got the quick response back to me w.r.t. the
hood/hatch struts.

928 International ROCKS!  Mark, thanks for the parts and thanks for
getting them to me so quickly.

OK. Now how in the _heck_ does the cast aluminum, pod mounting ignition 
switch assy come off? I took everything apart, took the circlip off, removed
the 3 bolts for the height adjuster and began pulling. I didn't want to
pull too hard for fear of busting something. Here's a great part of the
story --> all this time, I've been driving the car around with another
ignition switch (sans tumbler) plugged into the harness. You know...just
use a screwdriver to twist the switch and start the car. Anyway, I'd never
understood why the steering column wasn't locked. I have no key to turn
the tumbler. The key I got with the car doesn't turn it. So the tumbler
has always been in the "off" position...but the steering wheel wasn't
locked. OK. Fine with me. Now, I'm working on the dash to get the lights
and guages to work (ribbon connector toasted) and I figure I'll just go
ahead and pull the ignition switch tumbler out and get it re-keyed to fit
the original key (had one cut from VIN). There's a little pin on the top 
of the cast aluminum piece right over the tumbler. Maybe I drive this pin
down and the tumbler assy comes out? I don't know, so I try it. Nope. The
tumbler still won't come out. I try to get the whole cast aluminum out,
but I can't (someone is about to answer that mystery for me, right?). So,
I give up for the time being and put the steering wheel back on so that I
can simply move the car out of the middle of the garage for the night. I
start it up and start to back out and turn the wheel and 

CLICK!

It locks! Oh, no...no...don't do this to me!

So I put the old key in the tumbler and _work_ it for about 3 minutes and
it finally turns the tumbler. Yah hoo! Wow...now the door buzzer works to.
But I can't take the key out. I did and got myself back into the locked
problem and it took another 3 minutes of panic to get the tumbler to turn
again.

The column needs to be re-keyed. How does it come out?
