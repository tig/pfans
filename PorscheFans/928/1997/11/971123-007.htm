Andy,

I didn't want to own a Porsche.  I've never wanted one at all.  I have had Lotus' and wanted
Ferraris for years.  Then I got BMWs kinda by mistake - I fell into a very cheap 323i when
I needed another car.  And that taught me two things... it showed me German build quality
and engineering.  And it showed me I didn't mind people thinking I was a wanker for having
a BMW.

I worked my way up the range to an immaculate 535i with all the M-Tech bits.  Driving it
home from the Bay of Islands one afternoon I took some back roads and simply reinforced
the fact that it was a lounge suite.  A couch and two armchairs capable of 0-60 in 7.5
and 220 km/h.  And that was a good thing.  Because I needed a lie down after the
Kaukapakapa - Wellsford road at speed.

My neighbour (a Ferrari owner) was over for a beer the following night and I was speaking
at length about the shortfalls of the 535i and how I should have an M5 instead.  He
handed me an AutoTrader with a 1988 928 5 spd for $70,000 ono and said "Same money,
heaps more car."  I protested loudly that I would never own a Porsche.

He smiled.  He dropped me in a coupe of books with 928 road tests the next day.  I
phoned about the black '88 car and it turned out to be something special.  The rest
is history.  (The story of buying it makes good telling - sometime...)

I simply bought it because it's the fastest, best handling, most practical car that my
budget could buy.  The looks grew on me once I bought it.  Now... I'd probably 
still sell it for a Countach.  Heh heh.  Yeah, like who's kidding who.

Regards,

Philip

PS  That same neighbour had his first drive of my car yesterday.  I've just build
an accelerometer that logs performance data on my laptop and I wanted to test
it and calibrate it.  I went next door and said "Can you spare an hour to thrash
the living daylights out of my Porsche while I play with a laptop?"

End result - the accelerometer works fine, and David likes my car better than
his Ferarri.
