	There are basically 2 reasons why a car won't start; no gas or no spark



	A 928 is not a normal car so we don't get just normal problems...



	There are 3 temp sensors on the front top of the motor, wonder why they 
are easy to get at?  One is for the gauge, another is the engine temp 
sensor and the third is the cold start switch (thermo temp).  If the 
engine temp sensor is bad it can cause a no start.  If the thermo temp is 
bad it will cause all kinds of funny start problems.  Mine would start 
after 5 or 6 tries but leave the car sit for several days and it would 
fire up right away.  Leave the car at the airport go on travel for a few 
days, the car would fire right up then the fun would start.  Just as I 
paid to get out of the parking lot hit the gas to pull into traffic and 
the old shark would come to its knees, floor it or die in traffic, the 
rear wheels would spin.  It would bearlly idle practically no power, it 
would run this way for about 5 minutes, then it was fine.



	If a 928 won't start keep trying the thermo switch will get warmed up 
and then it will start, the switch is warmed by the coolant and by the 
ignition circuit,  by warming it electrically it is supposed to shut off 
after a few seconds.  A bad electrical connection to one of the sensers 
could also cause a problem, so check the connections while letting the 
poor starter rest.



	It would be possible to make a limp home kit, the manual shows the 
running settings on/off and ohms.  The sensors could be disconnected and 
a resistor installed for the engine temp, the thermo temp is a switch so 
that would be either on or off.  If you don't have a digital volt/ohm 
meter get one, harbor frieght, cheap, if you don't need one now you will.



	Little bit of trivia: A water pump for a Ford T-bird V-6 is $14 rebuilt!
