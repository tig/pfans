I've seen one painted up with a lightbar on it before.  Talk about scary
law enforcement authority.  Wonder what they would put in the police
package with that.....

That's what the California Highway Patrol has to do with their police
Mustangs.  Same for the other places using them.  Kentucky has some of the
new Camaro Z28s for speed enforcement as well.

Well, if in route to a crime in progress or in apprehending a lawbreaker
under threat of endangering or killing other innocent people, the police
can probably do so anywhere.

Yeah.  Cool.

I've got a weird one for you copwise.  Just bought my Mustang (can't find
any decent 944s around here, and 928s were too expensive at the time) and
came off of the Interstate.  Car came flying up on me at the stop sign at
the bottom of the offramp.  I jumped out and accelerated briskly to the
speed limit.  Sure enough here he comes flying up on me again.  Next stop
sign, right on my bumper again.  So again, brisk take off, stop light, same
thing.  After we go across the street there, blue lights in the bumper!!
Doh!!  He asks me what the heck is going on, (and having this really occur,
I was ready), I told him that I have had maniacs try to follow and bodily
injure me, so that's why I have a car that flies.  He said my brake lights
weren't coming on, I told him I hadn't had the car but a couple of weeks,
and he let me go and told me to get 'em fixed.  Didn't even try to argue
about my rocket ship blastoffs or speeding.  Guess he realized I'd be the
one that got away :)  All of them
aren't bad.
