Don't know.  Interesting question.

	For bare metal sanding, it would depend wiich metal you bared.
Obviously once all the paint is off, any further, and you're into the
Zinc.  I'm not sure how the first layer of paint is applied, and whether
there's any chemical reaction between the paint and the zinc.  If so it
would be difficult to get off all the paint, and none of the zinc.  There
are now guns which can spray liquid metal.  I don't know if zinc is one
of the metals, nor if this would be a suitable application for such a gun.
	I should be most surprised if steam cleaning caused any problems.
Especially since Porsche themselves recommend a thorough steam cleaning 
after the winter season, followed by a rigorous inspection of the underseal
for any deterioation.  Maintenance of the underseal is most important in
ensuring the longevity of the vehicle.  The special lightweight editions
with no underseal did not carry the long-life guarantee.
	Buy a dog.  Pooch will gobble any fallen peanuts before they can
damage your car.  What you do about the dog-hair is up to you.  If you
have a girlfriend, pooch's breath may well prepare her for your own,
folowing the beer which caused you to spill the peanuts in the first place.
