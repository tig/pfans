Roger,

<< Has anyone replaced their S-4 or later headlights with the European
version?
 I find the headlights on my 87 S-4 to be ok, but only that.  They are very
 large, which helps, but are hampered by having a US beam pattern, and
 without the driving lights to assist them, they would be inadequate.  Bear
 in mind that I live in rural Maine, where the nights are DARK,a nd street
 lights somewhat sparce compared to any metropolitan area.

You might want to check out your friendly J.C. Whitney catalog. They have 7"
lights that have quartz lenses, and seem to have the same non-US beam pattern
as the Hella lamps. They are not DOT lamps. I have the Hella lights on my 83
944, and purchased the J.C. Whitney's for my 86 928. I can't tell the
difference in beam pattern. I ordered 90/130 bulbs for the J.C. Whitney's,
and they are white & bright. They cost less than $30 apiece including the
bulbs. They are made in Poland. The seal around one of the lenses had a pin
hole size leak (water entered when I drove in rain) which RTV fixed. I live
in one of the other Portlands (Oregon) where rain happens a lot.

Jacobs Electronics has a good setup for headlight relays. Quality stuff.
Pretty much a plug-in job, minimal wiring & drilling. Their phone is
1-800-627-8800.
