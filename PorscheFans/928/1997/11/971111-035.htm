Not to my knowledge.

From checking the service manual, the feed to the radio comes straight from
the ignition switch. The radio is supposed to supply its own fuse and
suppressor.

 Also, could it be related to the starter / ignition switch?

Good guess!

 Is there a

Unless I'm sadly mistaken, in the 928's electrical system, any terminal
marked "30" is supplied with battery power all the time. Terminals marked
"15" are supplied when the ignition is on, or the engine is cranking.
Terminals marked "X" are supplied when the ignition is in the "accessory"
position, when the ignition is on, and when cranking.

The above is probably useful enough to be put in the FAQ, and is probably a
European-wide standard.

Anyhow, your missing black/red wires are for the "X" terminals -
accessories. One goes to the light switch (to power the main light relays),
the other goes straight to the fuse board.

The wire coming out of the ign switch for radio power _should_ be
red/black, and coming out of terminal "R".

I suspect that this wire has been bypassed to the alarm connector instead
of the radio. You need to recover this wire and hook it to the fuse on your
radio instead.

Good luck!

PS. If anyone out there wants to install an accessory that only operates
when the ignition is turned off, use the green wire that coms eout out of
terminal "P". That wire goes to the parking light switch. I have my green
wire hooked up to the electric dog collar on my doberman. :^)
