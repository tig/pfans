(wondering about how well Porsche handled the galvanic reactions between all
that aluminium & steel)

This is a great question. There was a lot of discussion earlier about
stiffness of aluminum structures but what about the galvanic action where the
steel chassis meets the aluminum skin and suspension components in our
sharks? I assume porsche must use some form of sealer (urethane?) or
something. The nose and tail pieces are urethane aren't they? I have never
noticed any of the tell tale white crystals growing around the perimeter of
the body panels and my car is an early edition (old). I used to have a '66
Rover 109 that did exhibit aluminum corrosion. The constructin of the Rover
was suprisingly similar (Duralloy shell over a steel chassis).

When we have reconstructive surgery done do we need to worry about resealing
the components against galvanic corrosion? Anybody got the answer?

Jay,
I know nothing of the process involved in "galvanizing" steel, but my
linguisting leaning (strophically shared by many of our cohorts on this list)
make me wonder about the "galvanic" root word.  Does the galvanizing process
change the material at the molecular level (i.e., all the way through) or is
this simply a surface treatment that could be removed by sandng, steam
cleaning, etc.?  Does galvanized steel react differently in contact with a
dissimilar metal (e.g., aluminium) than regular steel alloys?

Some life changes may take me and my gotta-be-a-daily-driver 928 from Tucson,
AZ to snowier climes, so my interest is more than academic.

Any of our resident metallurgists care to chime in?
