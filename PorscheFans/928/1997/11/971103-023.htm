Me too!  I was also fortunate enough to have Mike as instructor
co-pilot.  My times improved a full 2.6 seconds over the three runs I
made.  My best time was 34.034 including a 1 sec penalty for the cone I
massacred.  I tore off my brake air scoops two times and when I got home
found my rear sway bar had become disconnected on one side.  Boy is it
fun to toss these Porsche cars around!

BTW, next Sat there is an AX in Sacramento for those so inclined.  I
need to get a new sway bar first so I probably won't go.

What a coincidence!  I got a ride with Mike in his 944T plus a real
hair-raiser with his wife.  I think she might have been faster!

Phil a morning person? Nah.

There is a Drivers' Ed (high speed driving) course coming up in early
December at Sears Point....
