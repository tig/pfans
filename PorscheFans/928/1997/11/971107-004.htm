Yes I did.  Glad that you got it updated!

Depending on what mileage yopu would consider I would say that low to
mid $20's for a very good condition 5-spd would be about the right
price.  Right now the number of 928's has dramatically dropped, esp.
5-spds.  Although I have seen a few overpriced examples in AutoWeek in
the past few days.  Who knows what will happen with 928 prices though. 
My thoughts are that they have bottomed out, esp for the 87 and newer
models, but the auto market is a very strange thing.

I know what you mean ... going without my 930 for the past week has
driven me crazy!  Although I know it will be worth it when all that
power is once again getting to the road via the new clutch.

Talk to you later,
Brian
