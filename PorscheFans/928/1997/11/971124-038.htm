Greetings all.  In search of the collective wisdom after the obligatory
check of Stephane's FAQ list.

When upgrading to the S-4 brakes (from a '79 Euro, in this case), I am
told that changing to an '87+ master cylinder is required.  Upon
comparing the old MC to the new, there are fewer ports on the new.

So, what happens if I don't change the MC?  The two weigh within grams
of each other and share basic outside dimensions.  Is it therefore safe
to assume that the fluid volumes are roughly equal?  Even if they're
not, as long as the system is full, does the MC "know" it's pushing
fluid into bigger calipers?  Should it make a difference?  Is the '87 MC
different due to the intro of ABS or is my old Euro MC different from an
old US one?

Awaiting sage wisdom and sundry punctuation advice, TIA.
