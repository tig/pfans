Dear Steve ('87S4/auto/white) and fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

Steve, your reply is basically correct. However, I want to correct a
possible
misunderstanding. The brake regulator in no way reduces the amount of force
transmitted to the front brakes. It only allows more pressure to the rears.
Since 1986, all 928's have ABS, so the need for an 18 Bar regulator may be
overkill. By increasing the amount of braking done by the rear brakes, the
front brakes are assisted to a greater extent and, therefore, do not wear
down quite as fast. One benefit from this is the front pads need only be
replaced twice as often as the rears instead of three times as often. As 
you correctly pointed out, under braking the weight of the car shifts
forward. 
Thus the front pads will always wear faster due to the fact that they do
more 
than 50% of the braking.

Although the braking improvement will be noticed at an autocross, it has
greater benefit while on the track. Since the rears are contributing more to

the overall braking effort the time spent braking will/should be reduced, so

the front pads should run slightly cooler than before.

Happy motoring. Ed
