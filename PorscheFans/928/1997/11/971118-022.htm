Hey, I don't think tupperware is an insult of any kind to the Corvette.  I've had
various different Lotus' for the past 15 years and we've always refered to them
as being made of "Tupperware and Meccano".

It's just a shame the Poms didn't look more closely at what Chevrolet were doing
with GRP... they launched into the fibreglass world with the Daimler Dart and
it was years before anyone on that side of the ocean actually got it right.

Who was it, in the course of a cow contact story, who called the Corvette a
"tupperware car"?  Come, sir, be fair!  Is this, perhaps, some form of
Germanic envy?  Remember, it was the original Volkswagen that needed to be
"burped" before achieving a watertight seal.  I would think, appropros the
Corvette, that "Ziploc" or "Glad Bag" would serve better.

P.S.
For anyone suffering 928 electrical uber-load, remember that BMW (I think)
invented the driver's door window that would electronically open just a
smidgen to allow complete closure, then roll up the window.  Imagine the
wires and relays posts that will suck up BMW list bandwith in a few years!!!
