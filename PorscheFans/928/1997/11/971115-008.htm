Hello SharkFans,

Quite a few articles about speeders lately. In my opinion if there
nothing else on the road its fine. If there heavy traffic about its not
on, which I'm sure most people would agree with. One of the best buzzes
I ever had in my 951S was doing 150 odd in the company of an S4sport,
early one morning on a three mile stretch of deserted dual carriageway
(strange how what look like straight roads have bends at this speed).
As the serpent said, the forbidden fruit always tastes sweeter.

However here are two incidents from the UK were the drivers regretted
it:

TOP GEAR magazine interviewed a Carrera 4 driver who had been banned for
six months and given a 2000pound fine after being clocked at 147mph.
Chef G. Ramsay admitted to the magazine seeing an indicated 166mph a
little earlier to the incident and then stated.....But name me another
person with a Carrera that does NOT do more than 150mph!!!

THE DAILY RECORD recently sported a front page headline about an S2
Cabriolet driver who hit speeds of 80mph as he raced for eight miles,
AFTER hitting 3 parked cars and RIPPING ONE OF HIS FRONT WHEELS OFF!!!
Obviously he is not an ambassador for the marque.
