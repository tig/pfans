Andy:
	Nevada is probably the spot you'd land, although its a pretty arid
place.  Sort of our Outback. Las Vegas and Reno are a little garish,
which leaves the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe. Your radius would be
proscribed however, cause California lies to the north and west. Its
gotten very expensive.  Idaho is a possibility.  The long hair shouldn't
be a problem in the redneck West anymore, as most rednecks are either
sporting long hair themselves or they've shaved their heads. I once
negotiated an 80 mph radar ticket down to Excessive Energy Consumption
by showing the court clerk my detector and that my defense was that the
detector was silent when the cop said he painted me.
