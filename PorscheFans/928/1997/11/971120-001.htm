Alrighty than, I am now pulling my hair out (Damn I'm starting to look like
my old man!). Heres the scenario.  I have an 87 S4 with the eight speaker
system, Reno head unit, and Blauplunkt amp (4x20watt).  I want to run this
into a Sony XEC-505 electronic crossover utilizing RCA's (I think I can use
this apostraphy).  The head unit and amp use an 8 pin din.  I couldn't find
a converter plug so I wired my own using the original plug as a schematic. 
Now after I have every thing wired I have an 8 pin din running into 4 RCA's
for the head unit, and another one for the amp, which both go into the
crossover.  My problem is I can only get the left rear channel and the
right channel.  I presume the amp is four channel so what am I doing wrong?
If this makes sense to anyone, please help.  I am doing it this way as I
didn't want to cut up the original din cable and I also want to run another
amp (alphasonic) for my sub woofers. Has anyone hooked their face unit to
an electronic crossover? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  

PS:  I love reading the posts.  Some of you blokes should become comedians
in your spare time, as I am constantly in fits of laughter over some of
them.  

     Thanks.  Paul
