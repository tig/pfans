Hello, I am responding to Chris Task's question on wheel clear coat. 
Body shops told me they hate doing this too and that when they do it's
no where near as durable as the original.  I know a couple cool and
cheap wheel finishing options.  They can be powder coated, which you may
be familiar with for engine and exaust parts finishing.  This process is
as glossy as paint and at least 40 times as durable.  Easy to keep clean
too.  I paid $180 to have my four Mercedes wheels done and there are
three places here in Atlanta that do it (e mail me for help).  

Something else that caught my attention is Phil Tong's purchase of an
Eastwood company kit and home polishing.  The kit is under $100.  The
pros get four to five times this to polish yours.  Pretty cool!  Check
this out on the groovy groovy 928 forever page (928s4vr.com)

My E mail: eric.hoffman@hboc.com

p.s.  If only I could find black sport seats.  Not just any, they've GOT
to have that better lateral support.  PLEASE tell me where I can find
some!
