  Hi


   Just catching up with all the weekend digests. I was able to get my car 
ready for the track and instead of going to Laguna Seca I went to Sears Point.
Too bad both events were scheduled for the same weekend. Anyways, Sears 
Point is an awsome track. Definitely a high puker factor track. You make
a mistake here and there is a high probability of bent metal or worst.
I think that is the reason everyone this weekend gave the track it's 
deserved respect and kept the whole event incident free. 

  There was one other 928 there. Richard ? had his white 84 there. By the way 
Richard, if you are on the digest send me an e-mail.
 
  This was my first time driving this track and it took most of Saturday to
dial in the line. The first session The 928 felt really big and heavy for
the thight turns but as the day progressed it seemed to get in the grove and
just eat up the turns. I really have to hand it to the instructors I had, they
really teached me a lot about being a better driver. A friend took some times 
for me on both days, Saturday I was doing about 2:24 laps, but by Sunday I
got down to 2:01s and 2:02s even one 2:00 . Would have been nice to break 2:00
but that will have to wait till next year. 

  I'm sorry that nobody took the offer to take my place at Laguna. Instead of
reading about the virtues of the Porsche braking you should have gone out
there and done some field experiments. Here is my version of the math :)

2 days X 4 sessions/day X 25 minutes/session = 200 minutes on the track

taking an average of 2:12/lap

200 min X 1 lap/2:12 = 91 laps

at 2.5 miles/lap

91 laps X 2.5 miles/lap = 227 miles 

at 11 turns/lap

91 laps X 11 turns = 1001 turns

6 turns per lap require threshold braking

91 laps  X 6 threshold brakes/lap = 546 threshold brakes

who said math wasn't fun.

Lucky to report that I only had a few minor lockups and only one good 15 ft
4 wheel lock. Wheels pointed straight and the car went straight till I eased
off the brakes and got the wheels spinning again. This happened on the warm up
lap of one session. Learned a small lesson about cold tire grip, even after
about one mile the tires are not quite to temp yet.

   
   This ends my track season for the year. The next event will be in Feb. I 
keep putting up these posts to try to get more of you out there. Believe me
you and your 928 will never have as much fun. So far there's been no takers.
Anybody care to comment why ?


  By the way I got to meet Bill and see the infamous "Sport Seats "
