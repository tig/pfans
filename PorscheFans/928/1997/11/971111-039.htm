I am not a real mechanic, only an owner like you.

But, I don't, really.  Suggestions I got by reading the Bosch book on FI.

Does your Euro have two distributors like the 84 16-valve engine?  I have heard
of them getting out of synch due to a stretched chain (yes, they're linked
together by a chain).

This is a fairly classic control pressure symptom. But there can be other,
maybe multiple causes.

I really doubt that the problem will prove to be electrical. Most FI problems
are related to control pressure, or some similar type of fuel restriction.

Actually, most FI problems require about $150 worth ogf equipment to diagnose.
I just bought today on sale at Automotion (20% off every item in their catalog
11/11-14/97) the fuel pressure test settup ($108 after discount) the Bosch FI
manual is $17(Automotion has it) and then you might need a medium priced
digital multimeter (around $30-40 from Radio Shack or similar).  Hook up the
fuel pressure test instrument as described in the Bosch manual, take readings
and start eliminating your suspects.  Or, a really good 928 mechanic should be
able to diagnose any fuel problem for about the same cost - mine did.

Or,....

The REALLY cheap approach -- get a copy of Performance Products' catalog and
work through the FI troubleshooting guide (in my catalog #42A, it's on page
95).

it."
