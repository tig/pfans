Living in Oklahoma, deer and cows can be a hazard when driving at night.   
My girlfriend in college was returning to school one night in a   
convertible LeBaron and hit a heifer. It ended up in the front seat w/   
her. She ended up in critical care for several weeks and over a month in   
the hospital. In a coupe the cow may have slid over the top, in a cab, it   
just caved in the roof. They ended up winning a large law suit against   
the rancher who owned the unlucky bovine.

About six months later, I was returning to school late and met a doe.   
Funny thing, deer will try to dive between headlights to avoid being hit   
(from the trooper who, I'm sure, ended up eating the venison that I so   
thoughtfully provided). Over $3,000 in damage to my Accord, mostly to the   
hood and roof, but also a new windshield.

The motto, have fun, but be careful when driving in rural areas,   
especially at night.
