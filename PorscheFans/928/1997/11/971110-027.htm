Wow! Many questions spring to mind:

- how much do you pay v. speed over limit?
[Philip Adamson]  Lots... but it's only NZ$.  I seem to remember that 85 mph
(in a 60mph limit) last time cost me about $240.  (Does that sound right Andy & Andy?)

- do the authorities' records of your speed camera events accumulate in
such a way that penalties beyond money eventually appear?
[Philip Adamson]  Nope.  Not yet.  But I hear they are trying to.

- why no points when the evidence is sufficient to compel you to pay a fine?
[Philip Adamson]  Because they, as yet, haven't managed to make it law that
you have to identify the driver.  They got away with making the owner liable for
the car, but not personally for wearing demerits.  This could change, but at the
moment I am still enjoying the freedom!

- what are you doing for dinner Thursday?
[Philip Adamson]  <falling about laughing> Oh, Leonard, I didn't think I was
your type!!
