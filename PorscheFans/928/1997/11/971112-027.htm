To All:

	Driving 120mph and above on an open road almost anywhere in the U.S. is

dangerous.  At night multiply it by ?...you name it.  Doing it on a

track is dangerous enough, but on a highway? I will be the first to

admit that I have done it myself and it is stupid. The Law pretty much

everywhere calls that exhibition speed and that's a correct label.

After this I am done with this thread for the near future.  

Your estimation of danger would neccesarily extend to getting out of bed in
the morning.  What makes driving that fast on a highway more dangerous than
on the track?  (with all the preconditions already stated such as clear road,
good visibility, daytime, etc.)  Nothing.

It is obviously dangerous to even drive since other great big metal things
weighing several thousand pounds each could smash into you at any time.  So
what?  If it wasn't dangerous it wouldn't be exhilirating, and if not then it
wouldn't be any fun.
