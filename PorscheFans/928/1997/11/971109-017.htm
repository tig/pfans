I will also respectfully disagree with John Hall's comment that the rear
brakes slow the vehicle.  Weight transfer due to braking caused the
invention of the proportioning valve.  Many race cars have a cockpit
adjustment for that valve allowing the driver to customize the braking
bias between front and rear.

I will agree with Steve on his comments about braking, especially with
regard to motorcycles.  As he noted, look at the teeny-tiny brake on the
rear axle and the HUGH twin disks on the front!  As Steve mentioned some
people are aware of the "stoppies".  I have lifted the rear end of my
GSXR-1100 at 90 MPH under hard braking and good traction conditions.  It
wasn't until I let off the front brake lever and the rear tire came back
down the 2-4" and made contact with the pavement that I realized that
actually occured!  I have seen the likes of Kenny Roberts do it
consistently on his GP bikes!

This was one of the 1st lessons that a good friend of mine learned in
his early days of motorcycle riding.  After approaching a stop sign at a
brisk pace next to a couple of us, he stood on the rear brake lever in
an attempt to stop.  He slid right thru the intersection with the rear
tire locked leaving a nice black skid mark, as we stopped with no
trouble and no fanfare using a little more front brake!  Luckily there
was no cross traffic!  He then asked us what the secret was, and we told
him about the front brake.  With a short explanation of the physics of
weight transfer, he was made a believer!

This fact was further confirmed when we all went to motorcycle road
racing school together years later.  We found out during the braking
portion of the training that the rear brakes had air (no brake fluid) in
its lines!  The lesson was clear!  The front brakes do the stopping,
especially as the maneuver becomes more spirited!

According to statistics, a surprising number of motorcycle accidents are
due to the motorcyclist locking the rear brake and striking the object
they are trying to avoid with the rear tire locked and the fronts not
doing anything!  The rider is the proportioning valve on the bike (until
ABS, anyway), but without training and proper practice, there is still
too much emphasis on the rear brake!

I echo Steve's last paragraph!
