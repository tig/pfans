Yes.  About 8 years ago I was the "Designated Driver" and after a night
out was driving my very drunk friend home in my Dad's nearly new Dodge
Colt as my car was in the shop.  

While on a long straight road, my friend, unknown to me, pulled up on
the brake lever (which was mounted between the seats) and left it locked
on.  The rear kicked out, I could not recover and within a very few
short seconds we went off the road and hit a big pile of dirt.  Lucky as
the pile of dirt was next to a deep home foundation that was being dug.
I do not think the rear wheels braked evenly.
