To All:  Whats all this misinformation about spinning when you apply the
handbrake?  Has anyone had it occur?  .....The emergency/parking/hand
brake works on the rear wheels only and is a valuable tool in safe
driving while in motion. Perhaps some of you have worked out on a
skidpad.  When they do a spin lockup on the brakes its on the front
wheels only which causes an immediate spin. Just think it through. If
the front wheels want to stop and the rears keep going, even power off,
your car will want to swap ends.  If you apply brakes to the rears only
it is like a gteat hand grabbing you from behind and pulling you back. 
A spin wouldn't result without some strange inputs from the driver.  
  I use the hand brake all the time in winter, particularly on slick
downhill grades where you know sliding will occur. You slide, But it is
very controllable.  Try it some time this winter and you'll gain some
new repect for that lever.
