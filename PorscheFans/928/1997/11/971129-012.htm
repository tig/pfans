I'm wondering how folks in my area and elsewhere deal with what I consider a
major issue.

The great state of Maryland has finally mandated that all cars (within a
certain age, which includes my '80 euro) must be tested for emmisions via a
"treadmill" (really a chassis dyno) test.  Previously the "treadmill" test
was optional, so I just opted not to every time (with all of my vehicles).

This presents quite a problem for me since I have a major problem with
handing over my car to a random state employee to drive in hazardous
conditions (stationary objects within feet of the vehicle while the wheels
are churning over 50 mph on the dyno).  I'm very selective anbout who drives
my cars, and I don't relish the idea of a state hiring manager deciding for
me who drives my cars.

How do other folks deal with this?

PS - My car, as a euro-spec, is exempt from meeting the emissions standards
(I have paperwork to that effect), but it is still required to be tested.
Go figure...
