I assume you're talking about the real gas-discharge lamps, not the useless
cheapo blue bulbs, so then you're talking $$$. There are a few ways of
doing it:

Buying the litronic light set for a 993 ( $1,500 is the best price I've
seen advertised in Excellence to date) and retrofitting it onto your 928.
You'll still need your lenses as the 993 lenses are slightly oval, and
won't work without other modifications to the light pods.

You can buy a kit PIAA sells, I think it costs  $1,400, it has everything
needed to convert. It is a universal kit, made for all cars.

Either way, if you want the real Xenon lamps, they are pricey, but work
very well, all while looking very cool.
