I think an Acura NSX is a very nice car. And I wont lie to you, I think it
will probably be somewhat more reliable than a 928, but this is what I
think of when I compare the two - 

I have a 19 year old 928 (9288200060) 78' model year. When I drive it down
the street it still turns heads. 

Now imagine you are driving one of the first Acura sportscars, what are
they called, the Acura integras? I can visualize some of the early ones and
I am thinking they started showing up in 1985 or something. How many heads
do you think that one of those turns these days?
 
I know you are thinking the NSX is a little more exciting than an integra,
so maybe thats not a good comparison. But think about one of the earlier
Mitsubishi 3000Gts, they have been around for awhile. In my opinion they
just look kind of silly! :) The new ones are HOT, they look really nice,
but how long will that last? The problem with most of these Japanese cars
is that they are styled for the RIGHT NOW. Porsches have always been styled
in a somewhat timeless classical style. I can also almost guarantee you
that 19 years from now there wont be an Acura NSX mailing list on the
internet. They will probably change the body style 3 or four times (like
Nissan did with the 300ZX and Toyota did with the Supra) and then retire it
and move on to something more 'now'. In 18 years, how much different did
the 928 look when they stopped making it in 1996?

So you have my $.02
