There has been a lot talk about getting tickets and being pulled lately
and I found a newspaper article yesterday that interested me.

It seems this week in the Ohio Supreme Court it has been ruled that a
cop CANNOT examine your car if you have been pulled over for a traffic
violation. If the officer says that you are "free to go" and then asked
to see inside your car, then it's your choice and anything found can be
used against you.

I find it hard to believe that Ohio is the only state with a law like
this. I suppose if you are going to risk being pulled over, knowing the
law would be beneficial.
