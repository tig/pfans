John,

Positioning of the caliper on the rotor has no bearing on front-end dive or
rear-end squat, unless the caliper body is connected to the "sprung" portion
of the vehicle.  For example, some motorcycles have their front calipers
positioned at the front of the rotor while others have the calipers
positioned at the rear of the rotor (the same variation occurs at the rear
wheel).  If placement of the caliper could reduce or counteract front-end
dive, then all motorcycles would have their front calipers placed at the rear
of the rotor as you suggest since front-end dive is a particularly BAD thing
on a bike.

(For those interested, the "sprung" mass of the vehicle is the portion of the
vehicle suspended by the springs, while the "unsprung" portion is everything
else, like the tires, wheels, brakes, axles, etc.  The lower the ratio of
unsprung-to-sprung weight, the easier it is the keep the tires in contact
with the road surface when road irregularities are encountered.  This is why
monster trucks can't keep their tires on the ground and bounce all over the
place...the unsprung/sprung ratio is ridiculously high, ergo tires do
whatever they want to do.)

The force attempting to cause the caliper to rotate when the brakes are
applied is reacted through the axle at the hub, which has a fixed height
above the road surface (neglecting the small amount of tire sidewall flex).
 Increasing or decreasing the brake load into the hub will not affect what
the "sprung" portion of the vehicle is doing up above.  If the caliper loads
were somehow fed into the "sprung" part of the vehicle, then the attempted
forward rotation of the front caliper could be used to create an upward force
to be transmitted to the body, counteracting the forward weight transfer due
to braking, while the opposite effect would occur at the rear as you have
suggested.

A similar effect occurs on shaft-driven motorcycles.  When the throttle is
suddenly opened, the pinion gear tries to "climb" the ring gear at the rear
wheel hub (which are "unsprung" components). As the pinion tries to climb the
ring gear, a force is reacted into the swing-arm pivot (part of the "sprung"
chassis).  This "lifts" the entire chassis up on its springs, increasing
ground clearance.  Conversely, rapidly closing the throttle causes the
opposite effect...the ring gear attempts to force the pinion (and driveshaft)
down, pulling the chassis down with it, compressing the front and rear
springs and reducing ground clearance (which is not good when coming into a
corner while leaned way over).  In order to counteract this effect, BMW
decouples the pinion from the rest of the driveshaft by placing a CV joint
between the driveshaft and the pinion gear, and then attaching a solid link
between the ring gear case and and the sprung portion of the chassis.  Now
when the throttle is opened, the ring gear case tries to rotate upwards as
before, but since the CV joint effectively decouples it from the driveshaft,
reacting loads are not fed into the chassis swing arm pivot point.  The link
attached to the ring gear case provides the reactive load path into the
chassis, but the load is fed into the chassis in an axial direction rather
than in an upward direction, so the chassis lifting effect is eliminated.
 Note that these loads must be fed into the "sprung" portion of the chassis
in order to have any effect on chassis dive or squat.
