Well, if _I_ was a jackboot, I know which car _I'd_ be bolting some lights
on top of, for those high speed freeway pursuits. Woo-hoo! :^)

Off course, if an arrest was called for, you'd have to call for back-up, or
shoe-horn the vagrant into the hatch area!

Having studied the New Zealand "transport act" fairly thoroughly, I am
pleased to report that over here, a Police officer is allowed to exceed the
speed limit if it is required in order to uphold the law.

The great news is, he _doesn't_ have to be in a car equipped with a
flashing light or siren, and it doesn't have to be _him_ driving. So if I
get flagged down on the motorway by a police officer with a burst radiator,
he is able to authorise me to exceed the speed limit to deliver him to his
destination.

This is the stuff that fantasies are made of! The good thing is, if it
happened, and the policeman was impressed by the display of driving prowess
(very likely for a Porsche driver, considering the driving competence of
the average PC Plod), it would no doubt get around the police grape vine
pretty quickly, allowing you to be treated with a certain amount of
discretion. Note- over here we have _one_ police force, with nationwide
coverage, that does _everything_. No seperate highway patrol or state
troopers, and no making it over the state border to safety.

Recently I was travelling along the motorway going out of Wellington
(capital city of NZ). The left and middle lanes were occupied, and I was
gently passing those cars using the empty right lane. As I was passing a
group, I noticed a motobike bearing down on my, so at nailed it, then
pulled over to the centre lane to let him by. The car I pulled in front of
suddenly lit up like a christmas tree. I pulled over and stopped (very
quickly) and the detective was interested to know why I was going so fast.
I told him of the motobike (which he didn't see - too busy scoping out the
928).

He took my details and said he'd run them through the computer when he
returned to the station, stating that if he didn't like what he saw, I'd be
hearing from him.

3 weeks later I was driving through town on a multi lane road and a car
pulled alongside with two guys in it. The driver gave me a friendly wave.
It was the detective and one of his offsiders. One of the benefits of
having a small police force!

Then there was the time... no, I'll save that one for another time!

Cheers, and keep your eyes open!
