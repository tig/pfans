I understand.  I think this is true for many cars out there.  Performance
cars are not Accords or Camrys.  Even the NSX, for its vaunted reliability,
goes through tires like I go through potato chips.  There are quirks and
problems with every car.

This is the reason that I do not drive a 944 now.  Every one that I went to
look at was in pathetic shape, with many items in the interior
non-functional, roughed-up spoilers and paint, and poor care of the
interior.  But, again, true of virtually any car.

Hey, its the car that we love.  I'd love to own a Countach as well, but its
as big as or more of a hassle than the 928, especially in finding qualified
mechanics outside of Miami and SoCal.

I have a Supra (86.5) now, and these cars are wonderful, and mostly
reliable, but they have a problem with blowing head gaskets that Toyota
won't admit to, and many of the turbo cars are pretty high maintenance, and
if not maintained, then the problems begin.

Its just the price that you pay for ownership of such cars.  Performance
costs $$$$, how fast do you want to go?  I think this covers mods and maintenance.
