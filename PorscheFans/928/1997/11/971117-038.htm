<<What this new Ohio ruling states is that unless you are being pulled

against you in a court of law.>>

I don't think you understand the law.  And if you do, it wont be long before
it is struck down either by the Ohio Supreme Court or the U.S. Supreme Court.
 Since you cannot see drugs or weapons, or whatever someone would search your
car for (in the normal course of business), there would be almost NO reason
for the law.  If an officer pulls you over for whatever reason, even a
pretext to search as long as he pulls you for a defined violation of law, and
later finds evidence of a crime sufficient to form reasonable suspicion or
probable cause, his investigation can further continue as described earlier.
 As stated before and agreed to by you, a search is not a legal right of the
officers.  The freedom to avoid being searched or siezed unreasonably is YOUR
legal right.  The rights that law enforcement have flow from the converse of
your established 4th, 5th, and 14th ammendment protections.  By the way, you
refer to a ruling now and a law before, I'm curious which it is. And, if it
is a ruling, what the name of the party is so that I may read the opinion.  

<<Someone posted awhile back that they were stopped for speeding and then
detained for an hour or something while waiting for a search dog. This
can't legally happen in Ohio now. It's kind of like the opposite of the
seatbelt law here. He can't pull for not wearing one, but if you get
pulled over for anything else, you can be sited.>>

I still have reservations of your interpretation of the law or ruling,
whichever it is.  Aside from that, the person that was pulled over, if
actually detained for an hour, was probably unreasonably seized.  Therefore,
any evidence culled from the search at that point may be "fruit of the poison
tree", and would likewise be excluded from use against that person.  Notice,
the language is still "soft", with lots of probably's.  Why would you ever
get pulled over in Ohio anymore?  If you can't enforce a traffic law like the
seatbelt law, what can you do?

<<I've only been pulled over a couple of times and in vechiles that no one
would question if I was dealing or doing something legal. It never
crossed my mind that an officer might think twice about a younger adult
driving a Porsche. I think it's unfair, but it probably goes with owning
an expensive looking car.

A legitimate profile approved by the Supreme Court of Virginia, in a divided
opinion, reads close to this:

Black male, driving the speed limit, traveling either north on I-95, possibly
with Florida tags, but not a pre-condition.  Two variations, the suspect may
act in the following two ways (it isn't hard to spot the problems):

1) he/she might not acknowledge the prescence of the officer at all; or
2) he/she might look at the officer directly, or indirectly through the use
of the mirrors.

Both of the above have been claimed to be "signs" that the officers use to
evaluate if reasonable suspicion exists for the initial stop.  

And don't kid yourself, the car, the age, maybe even the day of the week, are
all reasons officers use to evaluate if they want to make a stop.  I, for a
period of years, couldn't drive in downtown Portland because all the officers
knew me.  They knew I didn't have any respect for most of them, they new that
I wouldn't sit meekly and be harrased.  Instead I engaged in the unwise
practice of being as rude as possible to them.  It wasn't long before I was
pulled over by 5 marked and 4 unmarked cars and cited for "improper turning";
basically, I didn't signal.  It happens, it shouldn't but it does.  So I
avoid notoriety.  As much as I can in the car I drive and on the bike I ride.
 Which isn't much in this small town.  So far so good, after  a year I have
avoided meeting any of our fine officers.  

Good luck, and if you find the names on the ruling you refer to, let me know.
 I would like to read it.
