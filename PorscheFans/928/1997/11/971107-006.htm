Okay......against what I said in my last post on the subject....guess I
can't just leave it alone!

    1.    I stand by my original post:   using the parking brake is not
a good idea except for what it was intended to do, which is insure car
won't move when parked, or as emergency when normal hydraulic system has
failed (e.g. emergency).

    2.    As to why ass end turns or doesn't turn really is not
important to me because it just seems unnecessary to me to bypass the
system Porsche engineered to safely stop the car from any speed.

    3.    I guess my attitude about it all is that if I'm gonna get
busted for speeding, or whatever, then I took the risk and will take the
hit.   I might try to talk myself out of it (as in someone's post from
the other day), or challenge validity of speed reading (as in another
post from the other day), but I'm pretty much the dull type that chooses
to just stay pretty much within prevailing speed limits (hey - the
person that matters most to me - wife - thinks I'm dull, so go right
ahead, flamers!).   That's not to say I don't ever go over limit, and
have certainly done some pretty lame things in the past (Note for Dave
Roberts -   YIKES!.......I have a very similar story to yours, but
apparently not the testicular fortitude to retell it yet).   I pretty
much get a smile chiseled onto my face just sitting in that darned 928
parked in the garage!    Don't need no steeeeenking  speed.....!
Actually driving it is a sheer joy!

    4.    Hey, "Can't we all just be friends"?   All of this simply
intended as friendly chat.......a real bonus is that there is diversity
and passion in the 928 community, and I wouldn't have it any other way!
