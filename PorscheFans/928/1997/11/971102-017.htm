Being that I have both a brand new Cobra, as well as two (running) 928s,
I can speak with a little authority on this subject.  All cars BTW are
bone stock, not stock except for $3,000 worth of "bolt ons".

My Cobra will outrun my 81 Euro spec up to about 70.  From 70 on, the
928 tears the Cobra a new A-hole.  Light to light, the Mustang would
take it, though.

Now, my 93 GTS 5 speed is a whole different story.  In every way, shape,
and form, my GTS will absolutely destroy the Cobra.  It wouldn't even be
fair.

I think that the early or some auto equipted cars would have a hard time
with a Cobra.  Any 85 on with a 5 speed would have a field day with a
Cobra, Camaro, or T/A.
