Just to fill in some history:  I've had my '89 928 for only a couple months
now, with half of that spent overseas away from the car.  In spite of that,
I've managed to log about 2500 miles on it, including the 1k drive from
Denver to SoCal bringing it back home.  The car was purchased sight unseen
from a construction guy in the Philippines, who had stored it 5 years
previous at his home in Denver.  He had the foresight to have the storage
prep done by a local dealer, thank goodness.  The car was un-prepped and
inspected by the dealer, and had a short list of PM things done like a
timing belt, new round tires, and fluids changed throughout.  (Thanks to
listmembers for all the pre-purchase tips!)  Also of possible note is that I
was not even considering a 928 prior to this opportunity;  Definitely a spur
of the moment purchase.


The reasons:

1)  I lost a girlfriend to an orthodontist who had a brand new bright red
'79 928.  OK, it's been a while so this one doesn't count for much.  In the
end she married a truck driver, had 3 kids and grew a lot rounder, so the
pain is long gone. (sob...;-)

2)  I looked at a few of the cars before I bought mine, but never drove one.
The spec sheet and the car's reputation were enough.  The cars I looked at
were pre-S4 cars, so they were not truly representative.

3)  I comp'd prices at the retail and consumer levels before making an offer
on the unseen car.  These cars offer amazing performance for amazingly few
dollars up front.

4)  The visual impact floored me when I picked up the car, and that hasn't
diminished over time.  The appearance of subdued muscularity was
particularly appealing.

5)  There's a certain exclusivity I think,  except that it is too often
mistaken for a 944.  Nothing against 944's, but...

6)  The car is an absolute gas to drive.  My maiden outing was the dash from
Denver, and it would have taken a team of plastic surgeons to clean the grin
off my face.  Effortless cruising at 75+ through 5000+ ft mountains,  no
problem passing on the uphills,  a quick but unintentional blast to 120 to
see what it feels like going just a little bit faster.  BTW, it feels fine.

7)  Probably the closest thing to race-car brakes I've experienced on a real
road car, with the exception of the 930.  Smooth progressive feel with lots
of stop available.  And a pedal that moves when you push harder, unlike
several "performance" car braking packages like the Corvette.

8)  I know several who claim trouble-free service at 100k+, with only
scheduled maintenance.

9)  The car has a total "brute force" personality, where everything it does
is without compromise.  Maybe that's a lack of personality, in that there is
no excitement that comes from wondering what it will do next.  No worries
that this driver is more capable than the car is, at least so far.

 
Negatives?

a)  The car is very heavy compared to the Europa S1 (about 1200 lbs) that
shares the bay with the 928.  For around-town driving,  this might not be
the first choice.  Two different cars with totally different philosophies
about performance.  Above 120 or so there's no way to compare them.

b)  Lately I find myself asking more and more of the car.  This has been a
precursor to higher road use taxes and insurance costs in the past.
Intoxication has its good and bad sides, so this probably needs to go in the
"plus" column too.

c)  Now that I have one,  the current market is way too depressed.  For a
car with arguably supercar performance and appearance, plus reliability
thrown in,  the costs are way too low.  Not important now, but will be more
so in ten or twenty years when I rotate this one out for something with
available fuel.




Looks like the positives win by a big margin, so I'll keep it for a while.
Need to join PCA so I can get in some track time and a few driver's schools
in the new car.  All the lessons in the Europas are lost in this beast.
Maybe a PCA 928 registry will be the push I need.
