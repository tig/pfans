Dear List,

Having been recently screwed by Porsche Dealer Rick Hill Imports, Inc. in
Kingsport, TN regarding the "great" '89 944 Turbo they were going to sell
me (I flew down to get the car and it turned out to be a real junker), I
have decided to start a search for a 968 since good '89 951s seem to be
few and far between, and the one super nice '90 944 S2 I've found locally
is unfortunately overpriced.

968 Particulars:

-  '92-'94 Model Year.
-  Will consider any Exterior color except Black; prefer Blue or Red.
-  Prefer lighter colored Interior but I'm flexible on this.
-  M030 Sports Suspension Package highly desirable, or LSD on '92.
-  No crashed or repainted cars.
-  Highly prefer Western US location.
-  Seeking an owner actually wanting to sell their car, instead of just
advertising it at unrealistically high prices.

If you have a car for sale , or know of anyone that does, please drop me =
a
line.  Thanks,

Tom Pultz <falcon@wolfenet.com>
