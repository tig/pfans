1. Anyone see that cop show tonight?  Evasion is a felony and none of
these folks got away (or went home that night).  "Don't run"...

2. Devek NSTY 928 reported to hit 190+ in last iteration... Tell your
mechanic to come out this a ways, or, see the Pony Express someday.  Or
hand him a copy of the excellence article outlining Bob DeVore's
accomplishments or more recently Marc's...

2a.  928 Rumor mill - be on the lookout next year for a new crop of
mega-HP 928s!  A new Top Gun in town?  Showdown at the corral?  New
speed records??? Stayed tuned... 

3.  Windows s/w - God help us all it really is everywhere

4.  Locked doors/beeping noise - if you have the illuminated doorlock
posts I know what sound you're talking about.  In my car it's very faint
and sometimes distracting.  I thought it was the light element vibrating
but someone else said it was a coil or something directly underneath
it.  Try adding some dynamat around the door panel to further insulate
it...

5.  Somebody get Eddie's Laguna Seca ticket! JIM !?! ALAN !?!  Wish I
could go but it's my wife's birthday this weekend and I just went AX'g
last weekend SO count me out this time :(

6.  Fragged check valve - isn't this the one to keep the fuel system
pressurized?  Replace it...

7.  Parts - 928 International is the place you wanna' be so go a fuelin'
up yer tank and hit the road with glee - westward ho, to cali-for-nigh-A

getting punchy again... I feel the need for speed!
