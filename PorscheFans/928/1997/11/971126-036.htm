It's simple!!!  The porky, front-heavy S4 understeers because the porky,
front heavy older-model owners over-eat!  A bit less pressure on the
dinner plate may help...

What you are missing is about 10 years over over-engineering "what
can we add that it doesn't really need that it hasn't already got."  And
why do you keep mixing your units?  264kg engine,  150lb worth of
difference...

Or maybe the extra weight is a slim ex-owner trying to get out?
