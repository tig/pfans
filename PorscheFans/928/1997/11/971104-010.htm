Yep. Measures and feels like about 50 bhp.

Custom reprogramming of both computers (done interactively on the chassis
dyno) by Autosport Designs (http://www.smarttrac.com/autosport/index.htm).

Nope.

Yep.

The actual situation is a bit different from what you think, in that the
stick US '87-88 cars have shorter (numerically higher) intermediate gear
ratios than the Euro box, making the overall reduction from crank to wheels
in those intermediate gears more similar than just the final drive ratio
would suggest. The US and Euro autos for those years, however, have the
same intermediate ratios. Here are the overall numbers for all four boxes:

	US Auto	Euro Auto	US Stick	Euro Stick
	(A 28.12)	(A 28.14)	(G 28.13)	(G 28.12)

1st	8.09		9.33		8.95		9.93
2nd	5.31		6.12		5.97		6.62
3rd	3.16		3.65		4.25		4.72
4th	2.20		2.54		3.22		3.57
5th	-		-		2.20		2.63

>Since I would rather have my '87 928S4 AT geared for acceleration

Remember, though, that top speed in each gear will be lower with the
shorter ratios, so, you'll need to shift sooner and more often. I prefer
the taller ratios and make up the difference in torque multiplication by
having more torque (see above).

>rather than a top speed of approx. 215 mph in 4th gear

Yep. The rev limiter cuts off fuel at about 6600 rpm, and the stock 245/45
x 16 tires turn about 849 revolutions per mile, so the 2.20 overall
reduction in top gear indicates a calculated top speed of about 212 mph.

>(that the car can't pull any way)

Well, maybe it can. A rough calculation suggests that a mere 680 bhp at the
crank would push the car this fast, and there are ways to get such a number
(though it takes more than chips).

>are there any options to changing the ring/pinion to a higher ratio?

Your transmission's final drive has 33 teeth on the ring and 15 on the
pinion (for a 2.200:1 ratio). The Euro box has the same ring, but a 13
tooth pinion (for a 2.538:1 ratio).

>if it means gaining a 35% effective torque increase at any given road speed.

Tilt! Shortening the final drive will necessitate upshifts at lower road
speeds, so there is a range of speeds which you can now explore in second
(5.31:1 overall) which the Euro box could only do in third (3.65:1),
resulting in a 31% torque REDUCTION at those speeds; similar problems would
exist for all the other gears. On the highway, where those who buy
big-engined cars generally like to mash the throttle and go, higher top
speeds in gears can be very useful.

>    1)  What is the highest gear ratio used by Porsche on 928s

The 2.538:1 I mentioned above is the highest I've found for automatic
transmissions. The GT manual gearbox (no auto on GTs) final drive has a 30
tooth ring and 11 tooth pinion, for a 2.7272:1 ratio.

I suggest you direct your questions about swaps and custom gears to Kim
Crumb (you are a PCA member, right?), who has explored extensively in that
realm.

>To get a 35% power increase at any given road speed
>would probably cost significantly in excess of $10k.

And would be worth every penny. As I discussed above, you will not get this
effect by shortening your final drive.
