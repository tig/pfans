Hi!  

I am new to this list.   I used to own a 1978 928, but several years ago
it was involved in an accident and was totalled out by the insurance
company.  I have wanted to get another one ever since, and I found what
looks like a nice one, but had questions for all of you.  This is a 1986
928S, but was in an accident, and has a reconstructed title.  I recieved
pictures, which show the cars condition, and it looks fantastic.  It
only has 47,000 miles on it, it is a 5-speed, and the owner updated the
rear end to the S4 rear end and spoiler.  He wants $10,500 for it.

I know the price and mileage is good, but unsure of the damage that
might be hidden, and of course the reclaimed title.  The car is in
Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia.  

And comments, ideas?  I am thinking of getting it checked out before
flying out to look at it since it is 3000 miles away!  Anyone know a
good 928 mechanic that can inspect it for me in PA?  Please let me know!

thanks for your ears and experience!
