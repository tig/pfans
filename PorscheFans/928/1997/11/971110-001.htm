Seems to me like you need to pick somewhere else to live within the USA
that doesn't have a bunch of arseholes pretending to "serve and protect".

Now, on a similar vein, if I was to magically obtain a visa to allow myself
to work in the USA, and I wanted to live in a place where the weather was
fairly warm (rules out Montana) and I could drive a 928GT around without
fear of police harassment (rules out wherever Paul lives), and T1 Internet
connections were cheap, where would that place be?

BTW, although I'm not a drug pusher or a pimp, I do have rather long hair,
and could easily be mistaken for a rock musician. Would this need to be
taken into account in choosing a location? I assume Alabama is out?

For sale: Spare apostrophes. Plenty to go around, mostly black sports
models with better latteral support. And, oh, they've been waxed as well.
