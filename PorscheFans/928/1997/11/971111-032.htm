Has anyone any ideas.
Another slightly more worrying problem, while checking the cam belt tensi=

first noticed that the middle two belts for the power steering and air co=
n. seemed
to be at an angle to their respective pulleys.
The centre cam belt cover also was split where the water pump shaft stick=

The cam belt and the water pump have been changed. Is it possible that th=

water pump has been put on and sticks out too much and is it important wh=

Does anyone have any ideas?

I am also interested in acquiring a dark blue (white piping) drivers seat=

right side, I'm in the UK.) if anyone knows where I can get one, it must =
