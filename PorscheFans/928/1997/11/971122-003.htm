Gang,

Here is an idea of what can happen if your torque tube fails...I was hoping
Sterling would post this since it happened to his car, but I guess he is to
busy.

His tube failed and set itself all the way into his tranny turning it into a
puree of transmission parts.  He was fortunate in that he had purchased the
limited warranty when he bought his '90S4 and this was covered.  He went the
"NEW" transmission route straight from Porsche AG and it cost over...drum
roll please... $14,000!!!  OH, MY, GOD!!  So fix the damn torque tube now!!
