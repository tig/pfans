dear prospective 928 buyer:

i thought i'd respond to your post, being that i'm a recent owner of a =
'90gt.
a couple of things come to mind while reading your post:

1)  To me, German cars feel quite a bit different than Japanise.
true i havent driven the NSX, but i would like to think that all that =
power from the rear wheels of a 928 has a certain effect on you.

2)  i would take the $15,000 and put it away.  Thats a good chunk of =
cash to be used elswhere, and perhaps on maintenance!  (wisely invested, =
the money would pay for any repair on the 928).

3)  Porsche is a company that is there for their customers.  The =
warranties and roadside assistance programs are un-matched.  They build =
sportscars, not econ-o-boxes.

4)  Typically, the newer cars are safer and more efficient.  I'd =
probably enjoy the NSX, but i'd say that you gotta go with your =
gut.......:-)

Good luck.
