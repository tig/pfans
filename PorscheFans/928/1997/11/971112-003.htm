Hello Fin-fans,

90 km/h in a 50 km/h zone warrants the same fine as 140 km/h in a 100 km/h
zone.  Never mind that the percentage difference is double in the 50 km/h
zone, and that 50 km/h zones are for built-up areas where houses and kids
abound.  There is a separate offence for driving at a dangerous speed, which
theoretically you could be nailed for, even when travelling under the limit!

registration plate, same as a parking ticket.  Hence no demerits.  
HOWEVER, if you are fortunate enough to have a roadside chat with one of our 
fine uniformed constables, after being "instant on'd" here's the demerit table:

	speed limit		Demerit
	exceeded by		points

	up to 10 km/h          	  10
	11 - 20			  20
	21 - 30			  35
	31 - 35			  40
	36 and over		  50

Not so long ago,  all speeding offences incurred 15 demerits, then someone
had the bright idea of upping the ante to 35.  In the interests of fairness
(cough) the current scheme was introduced.  (At 15 points, you needed SEVEN
tickets in 2 years to lose your license).

for 50 km/h over the limit, the courthouse beckons. :(

The fines run a similar graduated scale.
42 over ---> $370   ($US 230)
31 over ---> $210   ($US 130)

and the prizes?  100 points in 2 years ---> 3 months in the passenger's seat
                 100 points in 1 year  ---> 6 -------------- " -------------


My S4 will do 210km/h in 3rd, so with a 100km/h limit I'd btter stay in 2nd.
