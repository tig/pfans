In case I'm not being annoyingly redundant by stating it, the issue
operating in the current thread is that, with the stock 18 bar regulator in
line to them, the rear brakes will never break their wheels loose in
conventional braking on a non-slippery surface. There is so much more oomph
being applied to the front brakes that they will lock up first, bringing
the ABS into play on them.

Kim is encouraging people to use a higher pressure regulator for the rears
in order to approach the ideal (from the point of view of braking power and
fade avoidance) situation of fronts and rears locking at the same time, so
all four wheels will be providing as much braking as they can.

This may result in the rears locking first, but ABS should catch that.

ABS measures speed from a gear-shaped ring mounted inboard of each hub; the
wheel needn't carry any special parts (unlike the RDK tire-pressure
measuring system) to enable ABS operation.

In principle, this beats any of the fixed-pressure regulators, since you
can easily change settings to deal with circumstances (e.g., rain, loose
surfaces, less experienced drivers). Just keep the knob out of any risk of
inadvertent resetting.

Huzzah!
