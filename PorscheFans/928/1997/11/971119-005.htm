Chris:

Mark Anderson just posted about this earlier!  Tube replacement won't be
easy for the DIY'r but it's not impossible either, give Mark a call.  He
even alluded to redoing the internal bearings yourself but I have no
idea how you'd get in there to begin with.

I wouldn't worry about catastrophic failure.  Say the bearings ran dry
(probably why they are so noisy) then failed completely and all the
races/ball bearings/whatever fell out.  Your engine has enough torque to
keep turning (just like how those engines keep running even without
oil).  'Course I'm not saying don't fix it - just that you can still
drive it although it's on borrowed time.

FWIW I've seen ads for non-rebuilt tubes for $330 but again, no
guarantees unless you can verify the mileage of the donor car to further
hedge your bets.  Devek might have some tubes for sale as well.  Try
that Greg guy that advertises in the classified section of excellence
mag too.  Lots of other places to shop but it does come down to who you
trust, and who you want to give your business (and possibly future
business as well). 

That, as well as your 928 experience good and bad, is what this is all
about.  If it's any consolation, I've felt that same 'now what' sting -
recently two days in a row with first the fuel pump DOA (stuck at
night), then the 'magic' shifter cup syndrome (while turning in front of
oncoming traffic!).  Fix the tube and that will be the last of it for a
long long time. It is a major job though and you might want a shop to do
the service - it won't be cheap.  Unless some 928 fans in your area
offer to assist?

BTW where are you?
