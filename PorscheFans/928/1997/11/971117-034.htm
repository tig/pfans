Dear fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

My 86 has the BFG VR4's mounted on my daily street wheels. I like them and
they were relatively inexpensive for the amount of miles they last and
wet/dry performance. There are better tires, but not for the combination
mentioned at a low price.

The car has had Dunlops D40M2's (too noisy & not good in the cold-wet
stuff), BFG ZR4's (very good, but only lasted about 15k mi.), BFG VR4's
before the ZR4's (very good performance in all but snow, and longer
lasting). If the new Yokohama's ZR4's had been in stock, I would have tried
them. Alas, they weren't, so back I went to the BFG's.

Happy motoring. Ed
