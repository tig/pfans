Here are the wires that are in the ing/starter switch.
-Yellow (Starter?)
-red
-red
-Red with black stripe
-Black with Yellow Stripe
-Black with Green?(or Gray) stripe
-Gray
-black 
-black

If someone could tell me what wire goes into which spot of the switch I would
appreaciate it.  The switch reads as follows, starting with the starter
(yellow) and moving clockwise.
-50
-P
-30
-X
-X
-30
-30
-R
-15
-15

Which one should not be used? Also, when re-connecting the inst., there are 3
multiple connectors, in the same area I see a 2 pin(female) wire, where does
that go?
Thanks a lot for all the help.

<I need help with my 1983 928 Euro. I had the inst. pod cover taken off and
the ignition/ starter switch was taken off. I removed the cover but the wires
all jumped out of there places. I thought that everything was alright but I
just connected the radio to see if it was working and when I connected it the
antenna went up but I didn't have any power on? (the starter switch was in
when I did this). After I put the power on the radio wasen't working? I will
get the which wires I have in there but I have to remove the pod cover
agian.>
