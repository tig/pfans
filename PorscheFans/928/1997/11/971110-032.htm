I need help. 

I was poised to purchase a 928s4 within weeks.  Most likely, an s4 with about
50K on it.  however, I test drove an NSX last week and now i can't make up my
mind.  

It comes down to this.  The Porsche would still allow me to go out to eat
once in awhile.
the porsche is about $15,000 less than the NSX, but i'm worried about the
reliability of the s4.  I would like to be able to do weekend trips without
worrying about breaking down all the time.   I always read about the problems
that all you 928 owners have and it really scares me.

Can i feel comfortable with the 928s' reliability?
How much can i expect to spend on Maintenance annually?

I have saved for three years to purchase an S4, and would hate to diviate
from my plan.  Can someone convince me to buy the porsche
.
