Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe that is the case.  The
tachometer shows engine RPM and not drivetrain RPM on most cars that I've
seen, so changing the final drive in the rearend won't affect the way that
the tach reads, but the actual speed of the car in a specific gear will be
different at a specific RPM, say 4000.  A final drive of 2.20 and one of
2.50 will yeild different road speeds for a given RPM in a different gear.
From the opposite end, maintaining the same speed will show up as a
different RPM on the tach with the different rearend ratios.  This is a
common mod for Mustang owners, as in changing to a higher (numerically)
rearend, such as changing from the stock 3.08 to a 3.55 rear gear gives
faster acceleration in gears with the higher torque multiplication, but you
will be running higher RPM on the highway at 65 mph compared with the stock
gear.  In fact, when you change the rearend ratio, you must change the
speedo gear (but not the tach reading, which from
what I've read, many cars get from the computer now) to make the speedo
accurate again for that rearend ratio.  This is what would happen with
different size tires as well, its just easier to change tires than a
rearend ratio.
