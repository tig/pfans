I would publish to the list, but the numbering is HTML, and would get =
jumbled.

Here's the procedure - it'll take you two-three hours the first time, =
and (god help you) one the next:=20
Tips - buy and use latex gloves as this is a potentially messy job.  use =
a big pan, and a tarp or oil mat.  Have a few towels and beer handy.  =
Call your mother often.
1.. Jack the car and USE STANDS AND CHOCKS - your face will be at stake =
if the car falls on you. I like my face how it is, and you should, too.  =
As with other phallic things, get it up as high as you can.=20
    2.. Put your key in the ignition and unlock the steering wheel. =20
    3.. Loosen the tie rod lock nuts just enough to unscrew the tie rod =
ends.  No need to "pull" them off.=20
    4.. Completely unscrew the tie rods, but don't move your lock bolts =
- you will want to reassemble where they were.=20
    5.. Using a turkey baster (big opportunity for bad humor here, but =
trust me on this) empty out the power steering reservoir well.=20
    6.. Place a drip pan under there, and undo the TWO (just two) banjo =
bolts on the rack's fluid power unit.  There are four bolts.  Only the =
two that go UP into the car need to be removed.  The other two are =
attached to the rack, and will come out with the car.  Fish the four =
brass washers out of the fluid while saying something mean to them.=20
    7.. Unbolt the two large bolts for the sway bar on the drivers' =
side, and loosen the two on the passenger side.  These are the bolts =
that bolt the bar to the frame.=20
    8.. Pull down on the bar a bit.  If it doesn't give some, you will =
have to REMOVE the other bolts.  The reason I hesitate on removing them =
if you don't have to is because of the challenge of re-aligning them to =
reinstall.=20
    9.. There is a cover plate under the rack - remove all the smaller =
nuts.=20
    10.. Get out from under the car and get the oily sand out of your =
eyes and mouth, wash hands and face, repeat.=20
    11.. To remove the larger plate-bolts (4), you have your challenge:  =
How do I hold the tops of the bolts (!  ?)  You will either need a =
special tool of some unknown description (cha-ching), or just use a =
small-medium allen wrench kind of wedged in from above to keep the =
bolt-head from turning.  Sounds harder than it is.=20
    12.. There is one more bolt way up and left.  Easy enough to get to. =

    13.. Drop this cover, repeat step 10 above.=20
    14.. Completely unbolt the "universal Joint" lock bolts.  This is a =
splined shaft and aluminum joint and may need some coaxing to undo.  I =
just used a fat daddy screwdriver to spread it out a bit, and a 15mm+ =
wrench pushed into the gap between the joint and housing to pry it off.  =
It would have been easier if I could have loosened the top half of the =
joint from the shaft, but. . . . . .(Note: it is impossible to =
completely remove/install the joint onto the spline with the rack firmly =
in place.  Lower the rack a bit and pry some more) =20
    15.. Drop the rack with the tie rod ends still attached.  You may =
have to use some finesse (more foul language) here to coax it out, but =
it'll come out. =20
    16.. Clean the garage floor of all the power steering fluid you got =
everywhere and apologize to your wife for the mess and your bad =
language.=20
    17.. After removal, use one of those battery terminal brushes to =
clean out the inside of the joint's (female) splines, and a little jet =
of ol'  WD40.  Also, on your new rack, do the same on the splined part.=20
    18.. Taking the little shafts off the rack is the worst part.  Take =
the rack to the corner service station where they have those HOSS metric =
open end wrenches, or do this:=20
    19.. Pull back the rubber boots from the rack toward the ends.  =
There is a set of grooves near the end of the rack that you hold, and =
UNSCREW the tie rod portion from the rack.  Grunt loudly, get ten bucks =
out of your wallet and go back to step 18.  If you injured yourself, get =
your hernia operation and go back to step 18.=20
    20.. If you bought a used or rebuilt rack, make sure that there is =
no more of that wretched goo (old parts cleaner fluid) in the rack's =
plumbing.  Stand the rack on the ends and press down a few times.  =
Expect the goo to spew, so be prepared with a shop towel.=20
    21.. Use loctite to reinstall this part.=20
    22.. Note that there is a groove in the splined shaft on the rack.  =
This is where the joint's lock bolt passed-by.  There is margin for =
error, but align this as best you can upon assembly.=20
    23.. Undocumented tip for anal-retentive (perfectionist) shark =
owners you do not NEED to do this:  Your rack has a little plastic thumb =
screw that comes off with a twist. (that's what thumb screws do, I'm =
told)  Once you have your rack back in, at least have your universal =
joint bolted on, you can perfectly align your steering wheel to the =
center of the rack.  Have an assistant turn the steering wheel slowly =
until the dimple, visible through the thumb-screw hole is perfectly =
centered.  Pull off the steering wheel, and drop it back on, centered. =20
    24.. The rest is basically "the reverse of removal."=20
    25.. Use ATF, not power steering fluid.  Follow your owner's manual =
here.=20
    26.. Lower the car.=20
    27.. Prime the pump !  Don't just fire it up !  (I'm serious) Fill =
the reservoir and bump the starter three times.  refill and run for =
three seconds three times. Stop and refill.  Start the car and turn lock =
to lock three times slowly.  Refill and let any bubbles settle.  One =
more lock-to-lock and the air should be gone.=20
    28.. Get an alignment.  Remember, not every shop can align your car. =
 Don't let them lift the car and decompress the struts. . .and don't let =
them tell you that the caster/camber is not adjustable.  Don't skimp =
here.  Ask another list member for local advice.=20
    29.. Wash your towels and then wipe out the washing machine.  The =
next time you do laundry, you'll be very sorry if you don't. . =
..especially if it one of your wife's new shirts was in the load (take my =
word for this, too)=20
    30.. Send cash to Steve Peck >WINK<  (stevepeck@bigfoot.com)
