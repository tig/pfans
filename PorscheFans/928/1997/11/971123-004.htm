Andy McIntyre <andyjmc@ihug.co.nz> asked:  Why the 928?

Andy,
The 928's inherent contradictions -- too heavy, too big, to "luxe" for a
sportscar, yet too biased towards performance for a luxury coupe -- makes my
description a list of features that do not necessarily add up to the sum of
its parts.  Nonetheless, here is MY list:

1) I needed something in my life that was not based solely on cold
"use/dispose" financial considerations.  I needed something that I could
commit to preserving.  I threw away my Braun coffee maker because it would
cost more to replace a minor part than buying a new one.  Given my interests,
a fine automobile was a good choice for this small protest against
consumerism.

2) For this I wanted a car that would realistically reward such dedication.
Given my need for a daily driver, an Alfa Romeo 2000 GTV or a pristine 914
would likely turn to iron oxide during the ten-year span I used in my
calculations.  A Lotus Elan +2S 130/5 (or any Lotus) simply doesn't cut it as
a real car.

3) Maintaining my commitment would require something special.  I did not want
to be constantly pining for something more or different because of some
built-in flaw, like lack of power or ordinariness.  This last point ruled out
cars like BMW 6-series coupes or the first M3's... too much like "regular"
cars.  The 928 is distinctive and different, both visually and intellectually
stimulating... a front-engined Can-Am car for the street!   Washing this car
is a delight, not a chore.

4) My dream classics include cars like the Ferrari 275 GTB, Lusso and 330
GTC, the Aston Martin DB 4/5/6, and the Lamborghini 400 GT -- all
unreasonable to buy or maintain on my budget.  The 928 is the closest you can
get in the real world.  And what a deal!  As long as you don't try to resell
your 928 after only two or three years, and that you understand the
maintenance commitment/cost going in, a good used 928 is the
Price-Performance bargain of the century!

5) Kinaesthetics -- the sensory art of moving.  My car needed to be
involving, enlightening, capable of inspiring joy without too much punishment
or pain.  Try the shifter on an '85 or later 5-speed: it's like the action of
a fine rifle, each shift is a tactile delight.  As much as the 911 appeals --
size, litheness, power, looks -- I just can't deal with its ergonomics.

6) The opportunity to use the car as a hobby, a chance to share with other
enthusiasts.  Few other interesting marques have enough "installed base" to
generate sufficient cameraderie.

There are negatives, however.  First, the perception of Porsches (especially
the 928?) by a portion of the uninformed  -- as a penile substitute for the
masculinity-challenged, that Porsche drivers are rich country-club snobs --
does bother me.  So does the fanatical, blindered "there is no substitute"
crap.  Second, I am not mechanically experienced or adventurous, and the
928's complexity leads me to avoid taking on tasks that a simpler machine
might encourage.  Finally, the 928's weight and size tell.  I would gladly
trade power for the light and lithe feel and sharpness of a 911 or a Lotus.

As I said, my list for my circumstances.  No regrets!

I thought someone would catch that "Kiwi shoe polish" connection!   ~~;^-)
