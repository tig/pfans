Ed,

What is it about smoking up the rear that is so satisfying!?  I'm the same...
the ultimate take-off doesn't normally include much wheelspin, but just
occasionally, isn't it nice to let rip!  It's nice to see someone else finds it
satisfying!

I'll go and hide now.  Last time I admitted to this I got a flood of emails
flaming me for treating my car in such a way and telling me I'd break it.
My car is a thing, it will feel no pain, and if I break it then I have to fix
it.  In the mean time, I will continue to drive it, enjoy it, and occasionally
lay some of its extremities in smouldering black lines down the road. I
believe it will cope admirably and that the weak spot is the four little
squares of rubber on the tarmac, not the drivetrain.  If you don't believe
this, you don't have to be harsh on yours.  So there, everyone.  Nyeh.
