I feel a little guilty about continuing this thread, but............

    1.    I do not feel using the emergency brake for slowing down -
especially at high speed - is good advice.  If one side is adjusted
slightly diff than the other (YIKES); if the road is even mildly wet or
slippery (YIKES); if you must make even a slight turn (YIKES).  Simply
put, it is a PARKING BRAKE and using to slow from high speed is
potentially dangerous, IMO.  I think most of us can effectively use it
this way, but it's still very risky.

    2.    I don't think quickly slowing will confuse the law.   As you
know, radar is the speed of light, and Barney (Barnette?) can use the
initial reading to pull you over......even when he/she sees the reading
decrease.  I'm wondering if seeing brake lights come on might trigger a
psychological response confirming that said speeder 'knew' they were
speeding and ought to be pulled over?   Geez - way too detailed and way
outta my league here.

    3.    Big LOL to Philip Amonson's post (RE:   me against a 928)

    4.    Energizer Bunny arrested:   charged with battery.

    5.    I like you, but would'nt want to see you working with
subatomic particles (no offense, LL)!
