It was mentioned that the headlights on our cars look stupid in the up
posistion, but I think they look pretty cool. The color of my car is a
stealthy sorta color anyway, but   it seems to draw more attention with the
lights up and on. IMO, the pop-up lights are very tastefully done. I like the
teardrop shape as compared to most pop-up lights on cars that have square or
wedge shapes with ugly flat black paint treatment on the sides. When people
look over at a stoplight and stare at the lights, it's almost as cool as when
they're across the stoplight from you, (headlights not on) and you see the
person in the passenger seat mouth the word "Porsche" as they're pointing at
your car!  Opinions may vary, but the headlights are definitely a
distinguishing feature of our cars. 

I guess I'm the one that got this thread about the brake proportioning valves
started. I apologize that I haven't had the chance to respond or reply about
the subject more. Perhaps they can't reduce nose dive, but from seat of the
pants experience before and after, they sure seem like they do. 
That being said, the brake force regulators may work a little differently
than a straight-up proportioning valve, because, until pressure rises to the
switchover point, the same pressure is applied to the front and rear brakes,
and when the pressure rises further on the input side, the pressure to the
rear brakes is reduced by a set factor. 
A straight-up proportioning valve may, in fact, be applying pressures that
are divided from the get-go, with no switchover point per-say. 
For example: say with my current 55 bar brake force regulator, I drive with a
club foot, and I immediately go beyond the switchover point, then it is
acting more like a pure proportioning valve.  Does this seem logical? 
Oh well, as far as I can figure, especially in a car with ABS, the move from
an 18 bar to a 33 or 55 bar unit, has many advantages with no real drawbacks.
Incidentally, Kim Crumb did say a 33 bar might be better suited for a person
who tends to slam on the brakes instead of easing into them.
  
Just to set the record straight, (so you all don't think I'm a madman behind
the wheel)
my brother made me do it! ....I was on the way to the Grand Canyon and Las
Vegas
and when I pulled in to get gas in Corydon, Indiana, this guy comes out of
the store and says "Hey man, my brother's got a car just like that" (he
didn't recognize me with my sunglasses on) .....I said "Oh really".....He
said "Greg!" .....anyway, we talked awhile and I told him I may see what
she'll do in the desert on the way there or back.
He's an avid photographer and said "take a picture.....noone will believe you
if you don't". So anyway I'm coming back on route 66 between Kingman and
Seligman, Az., and there is no traffic whatsoever, and I turned around twice
to survey the stretch of road as I was thinking "this would be a great spot
to see what she'll do."  Well, to make a long story a little shorter, I let
the big dog eat and clicked a picture of the guages for my brother and
posterity. Actually saw 166 mph, but I can't prove it because when I clicked
the picture, the film rewound as it was the last one on the roll. The car was
stable at that speed and one hand on the wheel was no problemo.
(at least I didn't try to reload the camera)   :)
Ok, so maybe you all still think I'm crazy.....................
