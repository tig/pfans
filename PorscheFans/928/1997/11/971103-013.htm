Honestly, don't bother mixing....have a look at the stats on either
Mobil 1 
15W40 or Red Line's 20W50--the pour points are down in the -40 to -50
degree range!  You're not going to find it thickening up like a
petroleum.

The only time I've ever run Red Line 5W30 is in rally cars on the Rally
of the Lost Patrol (Seattle-Inuvik-Seattle), where we got down below
-50 for several days straight.
