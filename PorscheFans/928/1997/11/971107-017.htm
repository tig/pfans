phil,
Texas GT man here.
the plot thickens....
just thought i'd fill you in on the latest story regarding my a/c repair by the dealer.
they still have my car, but its not their fault.
turns out that the front evaporator core they ordered from PCN came assembled wrong!
something about the inlets were reversed.
they checked for another and all the stock they have in Nevada is assembled wrong from Germany.
my dealer was able to locate a part (old stock) from a dealership in Michigan and received it yesterday.
how could this happen?
is quality control that bad for such a major corporation?
what are they smokin over there?
i want retribution, cause that will be two weekends in a row w/no ride!
thoughts/comments?
