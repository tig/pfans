Sad to report but my 928 was broken into last night - the driver's side =
rear window (the little one) was broken and the lock on the driver side =
somewhat mangled.  Obviously the glass is no concern, I am worried about =
restoring the door to the original mint condition.  My first question is =
whether or not the door is all one piece or many blended pieces (my =
friend has a 356 and I seem to recall him telling me this about the =
front end) as this will obviously make some difference in the repair =
process.  Secondly, I have no idea what body shop to go to in Seattle =
area - I believe there are no 928 owners in Seattle is on this list but =
if they are and have any input it would be greatly appreciated.  =
Finally, has anyone had any experience matching paint - it would seem to =
me that the metallic paint on the car (dark gray) presents a major =
problem.  Maybe I have little faith in body shops, but I fear the worst! =
