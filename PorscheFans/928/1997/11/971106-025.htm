Will one of you technical guru's please help me out of my misery.  The
shark I just purchased had an aftermarket Clifford alarm.  The kind that
has 4 buttons on it. One for arm/disarm, 1 for windows, 1 for sunroof, an=
d
one for remote start.  The alarm was acting up, ( intermittently not
working or needing to be armed disarmed twice.) so I had an alarm guy loo=
k
at it.  The remote engine start never worked.  It would only crank the
engine but never start it.  The car had been running fine and then the
alarm guy looked it over, ( did not make any changes, just looked at it
under the dash etc.) and pressed the remote engine start which acted like=

normal. It cranked but did not start.  From that point forward,  the car
will no longer start.  It will crank but I am getting no fuel pump and no=

spark.  I had the alarm completely stripped out and found 5 different
brains in various parts of the car as well as a remote tracking system. P=
O
did not want his car stolen.  Problem is..,  the car still won't start.  =
We
have checked all the wires and cannot find why we are not getting any
spark.  I am currently getting a new computer to see if the alarm fried t=
he
computer.  any ideas?  the car is beautiful but would still look better
with me behind the wheel on the road instead of at my mechanics. I have
also checked and replaced relays but that did not help either.  The relay=
s
were fine unless I am missing a hidden relay.  any help would be greatly
appreciated.  PLEASE!!!!!    Alex3@compuserve.com
