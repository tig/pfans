Whew.  People do get riled about this, and understandably.  Vehicle =
insurance is
just one of those service industries who seem to have forgotten what =
they are.

I used to have problems getting insurance at all when I was 21 years old =
and bought
my first Lotus Seven.  The magic age in NZ when men suddenly become =
responsible
drivers is 25, apparently, but the penalties are still high for owning =
anything unusual.

Consequently a couple of insurance brokers here have got together and =
done some
research and there are a couple of different schemes available for =
classic and performance
cars.  I must add, these are both based around the vehicle NOT being =
everyday transport,=20
but for those in that category it may be worth something.  The company =
that I am now
insured with for the Porsche and the Lotus is Union des Assurances de =
Paris.  Yep, I'm
in NZ and I have my cars insured in Paris!  I have a mileage limit and =
some other conditions
on the policies, but it sure takes things down and the companies have a =
good reputation
for agreed values and payouts.  (My neighbours wrote their Elan off one =
weekend and
everything went very smoothely.)

If you guys in the US can deal off-shore, they may be worth contacting.  =
Otherwise,
do what a couple of the car clubs here have done and put a deal =
together, give them
some numbers, and approach the brokers.  They didn't laugh at us here =
when we
did it.

(To put it in perspective, my 928 here is valued at around NZ$60,000 - a =
normal
policy would cost around $2100 a year, I am paying $800 or so.  The =
Lotus valued
at $15000 would cost $1200 to insure, or $540 with a 4000 mile annual =
limit.)

I do understand that premiums here are cheaper than other places in the =
world,
btw.  We may be a long way from the real world, but there are SOME =
advantages
to living out here!
