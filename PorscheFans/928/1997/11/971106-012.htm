Glad to read you enjoyed your visit to Tucson.  I'm very familiar with
the Reddington Rd trails since I've spent days exploring them in our
Yukon (2-dr/off-rd pkg).  If you come again this year be sure to give me
a heads-up (and bring your 928/383!).

Speaking of your hybrid, did you build it yourself?  Ever since reading
about the '84 928/413 hybrid in the Oct 97 "Car and Driver" that
competed in the "One Lap of America" ralley (see p.175), I have harbored
a secret desire to sell my Bullitt, buy a early 928 shell, drop my
Brodix-headed SBC into it, and commit extra large zoom!

(Let's see, there's one in this month's Hemmings advertized for $900
with a clean title, and I know someone who lusts after my Bullitt...)

Talk to me, Pat.  If you built it, what kind on mounting, torque tube
mating, electrical, fuel, etc., challenges did you encounter?  Is the
whole thing feasable, or did it fall into the realm of a 1000 man-hour
engineering project?

Speaking of your hybrid...no, I have not done a time trial up the
Catalina Hwy.  Perhaps Rob has.  For those readers not in the know, the
Catalina Hwy runs 20-plus miles from Tucson at 2500 feet elevation to
the top of Mt Lemmon, at 10,000-plus feet.  On weekends the road, a
fair-to-good blacktop 2-lane, is choked with cafe racers, bicycles,
turbo 911s, and assorted tourists. Tuesday mid-morning, however...

The road up Kitt Peak is another great run.  It goes from about 2000
feet to over 7000 in about half the distance as the Catalina Hwy, sees a
fraction of the traffic, and is in truly awesome condition (wide,
smooth, sweepers, run-offs, etc).  It also comes with the one of the
world's best collections of telescopes at the top.  And they're open to
the public every day of the year, to boot.

Perhaps Rob Gold (and any other 928-philes) would like to join us for a
hard day's fun, then we could all adjourn for bragging rights and a
no-host steak-n-ale.

Tucson - where winter means driving your 928 with the windows open!
