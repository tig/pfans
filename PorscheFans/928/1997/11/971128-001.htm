Maybe members of this  group and others like it should investigate the idea
of starting our own non-profit insurance company for owners of Porsches,
Ferraris, etc.  I'd be willing to bet that a few hours research on the net
would come up with some surprising results vis-a-vis the percentage of
accidents that such cars are involved in as opposed to run of the mill
station wagons, SUVs, and pickup trucks that the vast majority of people
drive.

     I tend to agree with the comment about the percentage of accidents that
this type of car is involved in.  I've noticed that other cars tend to keep
their distance and drive extra careful when around more expensive cars such
as Ferraris and Rolls Royces.  Nobody wants to hit an expensive car and have
their premium raised.  A 928 may not be as expensive as a Ferrari, but the
common perception is that if it has "Porsche" stamped on it, it's got to be
expensive.
     The majority of these cars that I have seen on the road have been driven
carefully and well within the speed limit.  No Tire spinning or reckless
cutting off of other cars while jockeying for a position further up in the
pack.  The owners seem to respect their cars more and drive them accordingly.
     I have heard of small groups setting up their own insurance before and
getting lower premiums.  I think this is a good idea and would bring down the
cost of owning and maintaining some of these fun and enjoyable cars.  Just my
humble opinion, of course.
