Thank you Jacques for writing to me.  I hope you don't mind that I've
cc'd the 800+ member 928 list - we are all in one way or another fans of
Bob DeVore and his 928 development efforts.  

Someone recently asked the esoteric question:  Why the 928?  and your
email has one of the best answers for Bob as well as many of us too - to
drive fast cars!

Thanks again for the personal note...

928's Forever!
