I dunno but I think the 928 driver got the last laugh here...

No, no, too general.  You better believe you *won't* be racing any 928
that even sounds close to what I was driving last weekend.  It would be
foolish and your 'stang would be just a toy 0mph to anyspeed, trust me.

re: off the line, I think the 928 performs comendably and even more so
when you consider it has 2.2x gears and more weight than the average
sporty car.  Drag racing isn't it's forte but it still pulls down 13's -
15's stock, and quite easily (fair launch, granny shifting) depending on
year of car.

If we were talking 0 -60 or 0 -80 we should be talking 911TT but that's
a different list!


Good thread.  I'll have to start comparing spec's cobra vs. S4 and see
how the chips fall (btw are you running a chip?)
