<<I have an '89 S4 with central locking.  Whenever the doors are locked

there is an annoying audio beeping telling me they're locked.  Does

anyone know how to shut this off.  I drive in D.C. a lot where it's wise to

keep ones doors locked.  Turning up the radio is only a partial fix.

I have an '89 with auto locking doors when the ignition is turned on.  (via
the aftermarket alarm, interfaced with the factory alarm lock buttons)  No
beep here.  Even in Washington DC.  Maybe there is some problem with the
system.  I don't know what, but maybe the lock module on the alarm is
supposed to sense the ignition power, and only beep when the ignition is off.
 (and presumably when you are out of the car).  

I haven't ever heard a beeping in any 928 with the doors locked.  

<<4.  Locked doors/beeping noise - if you have the illuminated doorlock

posts I know what sound you're talking about.  In my car it's very faint

and sometimes distracting.  I thought it was the light element vibrating

but someone else said it was a coil or something directly underneath

it.  Try adding some dynamat around the door panel to further insulate

it...>>

And I do have the illuminated posts.  No sound.  At all.
