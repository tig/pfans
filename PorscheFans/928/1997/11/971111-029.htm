Porsche is not the only car maker to back away from front engine/rear
drive cars. Apart from the 928-wannabe Corvette, GM has dropped all its
rear-drive cars including the very-popular-for-cabs-and-police-cars
Caprice and its more interesting relative, the Impala SS.  Chevy dealers
currently have no big sedan to sell!


At the moment, Ford's Crown Victoria is the only game in town for
full-sized police cars. Unfortunately for those who like to spot the
bears by their light configurations, the Crown Vic's lights look a lot
like those of the big Mercury and the Lincoln Town Car, and are a
somewhat bigger version of the lights on Tauruses and most other "bar of
soap" cars, including many of the bigger imports.


Anyone know what the police forces will buy when Ford drops its big
rear-drive cars?
