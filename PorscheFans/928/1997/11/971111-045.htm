To all,
 I was very surprised at the shear number (about 30, so far) of e-mail 
inquiries regarding my "bad experience." And, hence, I have decided to 
answer publicly, as suggested by several.

  Okay, everyone gather around....it's story-time...

 In short, a one Richard Miller (who owns the twin turbo 928) residing in 
Ellenvile, New York ordered a Macintosh accelerator card from us on July 
2, 1997, took delivery, and never paid for it...even after countless 
phone conversations, e-mails, and letters since.
 It was most disconcerting to me, as our first conversation was quite 
friendly and based on our highly modified 928s, and the like.  He 
impressed me with his "story" of selling 3500 modems to various 
law-enforcement agencies in the US. Then after learning that I work at a 
company who makes Macintosh accelerators, he starts painting a glorious 
picture of how many he wants: 6 for his "office," and 50-70 for other 
"branches" of his office, and other "companies" he owns, and, the biggest 
of all, all 3000 of the law enforcement agencies he and his "companies" 
support.  Hmm. This sounds like a pretty good sales opportunity for us.  
I pass him on to our sales group, where he then orders a grand total 
of....(drum roll, please).....one.  (Yep, too good to be true...)
 We send him the unit...but never hear back.  Finally after a three or 
four weeks go by, we ask for the unit back or payment.  Now this is when 
the excuses and lies begin (well, actually, he was lying about 99.9% of 
everything regarding his "business" the whole time...we just did not know 
it until later...). Again, we had at least 15 separate 
conversations/e-mails about getting our product back or paying for it, 
but no dice.

<INSERT TONS OF CRAP E_MAIL CORRESPONDENCE HERE>

 Well, after several months of getting the major run-around, we decided 
to do some "research."   We decided to hire a local (in Ellenville) 
private investigator, and attorney to find out the truth.
 We now have a very interesting "file" on him and his antics from the 
last several years.  In short, he has *many* judgements against him 
totalling tens of thousands of dollars, is being criminally investigated 
by a New York Trade Bureau, and has no real companies that are listed 
with any state agency, nor any legal DBAs.  He does not own a home, he 
lives at his parent(s) house, in an extra bedroom, spends a great deal of 
time in various "chat" rooms....and his girlfriend (who apparently is 
attractive and nice [investigator's opinion]--poor thing's been duped, no 
doubt)...
 If this is what *we* found out 1500 miles away with just a few phone 
calls to some resourceful people, I can only imagine how many others have 
been screwed by this twit.
 He apparently turns money by doing Web page arrangement/design...that's 
his BIG "advertising company," of which he brags.  The only clientele we 
learned about were car dealerships he has done web "services" for in the 
tri-state area...I wonder if they know what a flake he is?

 Here are some of his fictitious companies:
 MILLER ADVERTISING
 GUARDIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT
 GUARDIAN CYCLE
 GUARDIAN MICROSYSTEMS
 GUARDIAN EQUESTRIAN
 GUARDIAN blah, blah, blah
 etc, etc.

 I have never heard so many bullshit stories, delay tactics, blame-game 
crap in all my life. I could go on and on with the details on just all 
his excuse-laiden "e-mails," but it would be pointless.  This guy is 100% 
total fraud.  Don't let his inflated pedantry about himself fool any of 
you, he is a scammer in the most basic, amateurish sense.  I know he has 
"befriended" several on PorcheFans, so now we all know what the real 
story is.  Bottomline: Since I "okayed" this guy, the $1200 loss comes 
out of MY personal pocket.  What a gutless, sniveling, mealy-mouthed 
prick.
 If he even attempts anything else like _this_ on PorscheFans, I will 
have to post all the e-mails and the rest of our private investigator's 
file on him.
 Ahhh. Now having done my civic duty, I feel much better.
