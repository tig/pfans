I have a question that has an obvious answer (change the damn thing you fool,
its quite a gamble not to!) But I am a little short of money.

I am doing a timing belt water pump and idle pulleys on an 86 928s.
I just found out how much a new tensioner costs, I have not priced a rebuilt
tensioner yet.  My car has 80k miles on it.  The tensioner is not bad, but I
would like to replace it if I had the money.

What are the failure modes of a typical tensioner? Does it just slacken
slightly, does it blow oil all over the place?

Is there engine oil running through it, or does it have its own oil supply,
and whats with the bleeders?

Does the tensioner just adjust slightly for warm engine expansion reasons or
does it do some serious adjusting?

Can I just replace some indiv parts in it myself from the dealer for a
savings?

Should I just leave the damn thing alone?
PARANOID
