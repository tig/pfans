After playing with CarTest and looking at the program's "Optimise Take-off"
feature I had a few discussions with people regarding whether it would really
be efficient to drop the clutch at 1600 rpm to get the best 0-60 mph times,
and also whether it would really light up the rears for nearly a second at
that low rpm.

It chirps and flies forward at much better rate than any clutch-slipping take
off I have tried.  And it doesn't seem to wind up the drive train badly, either.
Once my current accelerometer project is finished I will do some definitive
tests, but it's looking like CarTest may not me as far removed from reality
as we first thought.
