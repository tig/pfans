To 928 List Members:

A)  I'd like to know if anyone has first-hand experience with aftermarket
chip upgrades.  If so:
       1)  Was the power gain REALLY noticeable (or just wishful thinking)?
       2)  What brand chip did you use?
       3)  Did you make any other related performance modifications at the
same time and potentially obscure the source of the performance increase?
       4)  The proof of the pudding - would you do it again?

B)  In the ongoing discussion of 928 vs Cobra performance, someone mentioned
how the 928S4 ('87) has only a 2.20 rear gear - a real acceleration
performance sapper without a doubt.  Since I would rather have my '87 928S4
AT geared for acceleration, rather than a top speed of approx. 215 mph in 4th
gear (that the car can't pull any way), are there any options to changing the
ring/pinion to a higher ratio?  I would be plenty satisfied with a top speed
gearing of, say, 160 mph (2.95 rear gear) if it means gaining a 35% effective
torque increase at any given road speed.  What a performance boost for
autocrossing and track events!  Gearing like that would mean faster lap times
due to the ability to blast out of corners like a scalded cat!

    1)  What is the highest gear ratio used by Porsche on 928s and can it be
retrofitted to an S4 model?
    2)  Does anyone besides Porsche make a rear gearset for the 928?
    3)  What's the possibility of having a gear company make a custom
ring/pinion for the 928 - anybody have any idea who could do it and how much
it might cost?
    4)  Wouldn't you think that lots of 928 afficionados would buy one of
these gearsets considering the extremely high cost of equivalent-performance
mods to the engine?  To get a 35% power increase at any given road speed
would probably cost significantly in excess of $10k.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
