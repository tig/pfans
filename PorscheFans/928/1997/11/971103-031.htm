OK,OK, I have held back long enough from keeping myself from telling my
Radar/Parking Brake Story (mostly from shame).

I was driving back from Charlotte, NC at about 4am at night in the rain in my
then 2-3 year old 87 Acura Legend Coupe. I like some others had gotten this bad
habit of using my parking brakes to avoid slow-down detection. At about the S.C.
line I was about half asleep when my Escort radar detector when full-alert, the
shock caused me to grab the parking brake full tilt and here I go spinning down
I-85 at 80-90mph in the rain. After the 2nd revolution me and my Acura went into
the grass in the middle of the Interstate and I saw one of those large concrete
drain covers getting closer, my left front suspension hit the concrete on my 3rd
revolution and wrapped the front suspension under the car and unfortunately
amplified my spin down the wet grass median. It is amazing how wet grass will
not slow a sliding car at all. On my 5th revolution (I think) I realized that I
was heading for the other side of the Interstate into what looked like 4 or 5
18-wheelers in a convoy. On my 6th or 7th revolution, about the time that I
though I was going to be a ping-pong ball for the 18-wheelers and all would be
lost, my headlight flashes across a car sitting on the inside median of the
northbound lane and in the blurr it looked sort of like a highway patrol car.
..On the next revolution my drivers door slammed into the front bumper of the car
stopping my spin and then slammed into side of the car and both cars moved door
to door about 20 feet and stopped. As I looked out of my drivers door I was
looking directly into the drivers door window of the SC Highway Patrolman who
had fired radar at me and started the whole episode. !!!! He was terrified and
frozen stiff with his hands clenched on his steering wheel. He had seen me
coming towards him and had more time to freak out.
At this point I asked him if I could get out of my car and walk around (I was
shaking like a leaf) and he nodded his head OK. (he still hadn't moved of taken
his hands off of the wheel).
Anyway after 7-8 HP cars arrived and State Photographers snapping photos I was
given a speeding ticket for 85mph and many not so flattering words and questions
like "doesn't that Acura have anti-lock brakes", A few hours latter I was then
left on the side of the interstate alone with my car to wait for a wrecker.
One of the funny parts was when I went to pickup my Acura after 60-90 days, and
$14k of repairs, the body shop dude had only one question for me "What the hell
happened to the parking brake handle? when it arrived here at the shop it was
wrapped all the way back and over the center console in a "U" shape." I just
shrugged my shoulders, grabbed the keys, put my tail between my legs and drove
home.  Traded the car the next day for the new style 90 Nissan 300ZX ..... and
unhooked the parking brake when I got home.


Think twice about using your parking brakes to slow down from speeding,
especially in the rain, it is a bad habit "JUST SAY NO"
