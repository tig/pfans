There was a review in Car & Driver in the past year or two discussing 
radar jammers. There are functional units for sale in the small ads in 
the back of most auto magazines. You might observe most places selling 
radar jammers are garage operations. If the local law enforcement 
agencies can't find a way to prosecute a radar jammer, the FCC can.

As for their effectiveness? They work. But once a police officer has 
heard the model you are using he knows exactly what it is and where 
its coming from. Even in traffic.
