Re: Installing amps in a 928.

When I bought my '90 the kid had a Kenwood 200 watt amplifier installed.
He had the rear seat half laid down, and the amp sitting on it. I
haven't changed it because I don't use it, the antenna pre-amp is not
wired in, so I don't think much about it.  I need to go in and mount it
to the back of the seat so it doesn't fly around at all. This may be a
thought for your application. With it bolted to the back of the seat, it
can be concealed, firmly mounted, get enough air across it to cool it,
and easy access if you need to work on it.

As I said I haven't looked at the setup to closely, but I think the seat
backs latch in place and the trunk (boot)cover helps hide the seat back.
My rear hatch curtain is suspended on an elastic mounted bar, so there
is enough room for this setup, but I don't know about yours, but it
might be worth a look.
Hope it helps.
