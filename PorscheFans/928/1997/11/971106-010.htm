Just wanted to let everyone know that I have just finished reading the
928 market update in the latest Excellence.  I had a conversation
yesterday with a fellow 928 fanatic & P-Fan member who suggested that I
send an E-mail out to the 928 list to give my opinion on Bruce's numbers
since I have moved a few 928's in the past few weeks.  I would have to
say that with the 87 & newer cars (which I have been dealing with) the
numbers are right on.  I hate to say that (being an 87 S4 owner myself),
b/c the prices are so low, but Bruce has it right on the button.  A good
to excellent 87 is worth anywhere from $13K to $17.5K.  $23.5 for an
excellent 89 might be a bit high (as I have a customer currently trying
to sell an 89 black/black auto, 49K miles for $24K with NO luck), but
maybe it's just the time of year.  Just as a disclaimer, my opinion and
a nickel will buy you a cup of coffee, so I doubt Bruce cares whether or
not I agree with him, but I just wanted to post my experiences.
Brian E. Buxton
