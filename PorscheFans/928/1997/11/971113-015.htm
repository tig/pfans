<<BTW, has Acura fixed that NSX-replace-the-tires-every-3,000-miles
problem?>>

My, my how info gets out of whack as it passes from person to person. 
The "more than normal" toe-in on the NSX is NOT a problem, it is an
intentional design to increase handling.  And it does work.  And tires
last more like 12K miles.  I don't really want to perpetuate this NSX
-vs- 928 discussion any more either, but I never been much for logic and
reason.  So here goes...

The NSX and 928 are two totally different cars built for two totally
different reasons.  Just like the 911 and 928 are.  Do I love my 928? 
Yes.  Do I love my 930?  Yes.  Do I love both cars for the same
reasons?  No.  Would I trade a 928 for an NSX.  Probably not.  BUT, the
NSX does handle better than a stock 928, the brakes are excellent, the
ride is excellent, and the NSX that I have right now makes 305hp from a
small, stock, naturally aspirated 6 cyl. with headers/computer
chip/exhaust.  Not bad.  However, it has to be said that the NSX was
designed as a sports car.  The 928 was not - which is one of the reasons
that the 928 never "took off" here in America.  The 928 is a touring car
- luxury and speed in one package.  It isn't a stoplight racer, even
though it is fast.  The 928 is also very expensive to maintain and not
as reliable as the Acura.  Would I sell my 928?  Probably never.  Would
I sell the Acura?  Call me and find out how quick.  There's just
somethingto be said for German engineering and quality, and I'm a
Porsche kind of guy.

P.S. To the gentleman looking for an NSX/928.  Call me and I'll set you
up either way.  Also, the deal on the 89 black/black 928GT w/ 30K miles
