>>5)  There's a certain exclusivity I think,  except that it is too often
>>mistaken for a 944.  Nothing against 944's, but...

Phil and the Group:

So far, the ininformed group has included my accountant (who says I should
not have put money in another toy car but says she loves my 944 anyway...)
and a few others who  -are-  intelligent but frankly aren't car folks.  They
buy Mercedes SL's because they are "cute" and then gripe about the service
and gas costs.  I remind them that Mercedes is a TRUCK company that dabbles
in automobiles, and that usually ends the discussion-- thank God!  They also
accuse me of grabbing the 928 to use as a penile extension and a last grab
at some lost youth.  I get to sagely point out that in addition to the
'factory' fixture I've had a garage full of these 'extensions' since youth,
and that my real youth  -started-  a lot later than theirs.  Usually ends
THAT discussion.

It's the company I keep, to put it succinctly.
