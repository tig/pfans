Hi Steve,

With the accumulated repair and maintenance bills, latent is hardly the word.

I love driving.  I also enjoy the odd tipple ... these do not go hand-in-hand.
Save for the Air-conditioned Beer Chiller.

I'm sure the digest members will have views on this perceprion of reality.
As for price, 928's are none too cheap down here.  I originally thought
the $1000 was a typographical error.  Perhaps the parts price is to justify
the original sticker price?


> 6.  You were looking for an economical car....

I estimate I've burned 5000 litres since buying the car in December '96.


> 9.  It's fun to drive

And how.

I thought it would be unfair if I won the free apostrophes, so I'll
wait a while before posting my own story.
