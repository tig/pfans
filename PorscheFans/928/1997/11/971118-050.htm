David Christman, at the end of his posting regarding brake proportioning
valve adjustment, said...
  
"If your front brakes are locking before your
rear brakes more presure to the rears will reduce nose dive somewhat by
reducing weight transfer to the front wheels."

As I mentioned in my previous posting, nose dive is a function of the
vehicle's deceleration, and not dependent on where the braking force is
coming from.  If two identical cars decelerate at 0.9G, but one uses only the
front brakes while the other uses only the rear brakes, they will both
experience the same amount of nose dive (i.e., weight transfer from front to
rear is identical, hence front spring compression is the same).

Increasing the pressure to the rear brakes so that the fronts will not lock
as soon will, in fact, have the opposite effect to the one described by Dave.
 When the front wheels lock and then slide, the coefficient of friction
between the tire and the road surface decreases, which reduces the car's
deceleration, and thereby the amount of nose dive.  So when rear braking
pressure is increased relative to the front in order to eliminate front wheel
lock, the car's deceleration will actually increase, causing greater weight
transfer to the front with consequent increased nose dive.
