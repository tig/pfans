     Hi Greg,
     
     Sorry for the late reply, but I have been away recently. I also run my 
     928 GT in SCCA A-Stock Solo-2 auto-x's. The only mod's I have done are 
     lowering the spring perch heights in the front, an alignment with -1.5 
     degrees camber in the front, -1.0 in the rear, and zero toe in front. 
     I also run 245/45-16 BFG R1's on all 4 corners with stock 7.5F and 9R 
     wheels. I have done well on fast open courses, but still struggle with 
     the smaller, tighter courses.
     
     Changing springs or using non-stock wheel sizes will put you in Street 
     Prepared class. Either or both are allowed. SCCA puts 928's in BSP, 
     not ASP. For 1997 BSP will also include all Corvettes. Previously only 
     earlier model Vette's were in B and newer models were in A. They were 
     convinced to move them to B with other larger heavy vehicles as A has 
     been dominated by Lotus's, RX-7TT, and 911's all which are smaller and 
     lighter, but respond well to SP mod's. SP also allows external engine 
     mods like headers, fuel injection or carbs, lighter racing seats, etc. 
     SP also allows engine or trany swaps for cars on the same line which 
     makes 911's do well such as Curt Ormiston's light 72 with 3.2 injected 
     engine. Let me know if you have other SCCA Solo-2 questions.

     Hello all,
     Just a few questions to those who run their cars in SCCA autocrosses 
     or Solo 2. I currently run in Stock Class A with my car as it is. 
     (stock 87' S-4) If Weltmeister springs are installed...does it change 
     your class to Street Prepared ? If so, is it still class A? 
     Also.....Same questions regarding going from 16" to 17" wheels? 
     What classes, and, with what modifications are you guys running in?
     
     Thanks,
     Greg S.
