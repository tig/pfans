I have successfully been running  factory daytime running lamps for a little
over 4 months now with no problems.  There must be a socket on the
fuse/relay panel on the left side that is denoted as Daytime running lamps.
I will have to pull my amps which are located on top of the fuse panel to
get a gander at the Audi realy part number.  I ordered mine through a
Canadian Porsche dealer at the cost of $40 plus shipping only to get a
purple Audi relay in an Audi box with a Porsche stamp on the outside of the
box!
Istallation is very easy.  I removed the two fuses for the right and left
fog lamps and plugged the relay in.  I don't remember why the fuses had to
come out, something about causing another fuse to blow, causing the brake
lamps not to work.  I called the Dealer I purchased the relay from and the
parts dept told me the fuse numbers that had the foglight fuses in them were
not used in models with daytime running lamps....Oh the relay is like 8
bucks at an Audi dealership. If you use my idea, send $5 to cover the cost
of the $40 relay for learning this....(Just Kidding!)  I will post the relay
info when I get to the panel this weekend!


Hey Phil did I win the DEVEK shirt?
