RDK / Tire Pressure Bypass
11/1/97

Preface: 
Procedures given for informational purposes only.  No warranty or
assumption of liability is implied or given.  Proceed at your own risk.

Tools/parts:  
Small philips screwdriver, small flat blade screwdriver, soldering iron,
solder, 4" length of insulated wire (18 gauge or so speaker wire is
acceptable)

The 928 RDK was engineered by Porsche to make the car a safer vehicle. 
Tire pressure, or lack thereof, is monitored by two small pressure discs
per road wheel. These pressure discs pass by a suspension mounted
sensor, which is in turn wired to the RDK brain.  The RDK brain is under
the dash, directly above the clutch pedal.  The RDK brain is also wired
to the ABS brain, as well as to the digital readout cluster.  This is
just to let you know the complexity of the situation and a hint at the
caveats when working around any electrical components, especially
expensive and rare 928 brains.  As with any powered leads, use caution
to eliminate the danger of fire.

Non-standard issue or aftermarket wheels have no provision for the
pressure sensing discs. Thus without the proper pulsing signals to the
sensors (two signals per rotation of each wheel), the RDK brain reports
a failure to the display cluster.  Further, the RDK brain compares
pulses with the ABS brain and will generate the warning.  Every 15
minutes.  So yes your 928 does look cool with those big aftermarket
rims, but the false warnings are beginning to get on your nerves, as
well as take your attention away from the road!


Procedures:

1.  Strip insulation from the two ends of the wire, twist then tin the
leads with solder.

2.  Unscrew the brain from it's mounting plates (two philips screws).

3.  Unclip the harness from the brain (black amphenol connector)

4.  Use flat blade screwdriver to pry back the cover mounting tabs and
remove cover.

5.  Do not touch electronics inside brain

6.  Using wire from step 1, connect/solder pin 2 to pin 13.  

7.  Fold wire appropriately within box so it does not come in contact
with any other component, and has no risk of being rubbed or crushed
causing a short.

8.  Close up the box, reattach connector, remount brain, you are done.

9.  Road test.  Tire pressure warnings suppressed now.  PSD and ABS
should function as normal - use caution when testing systems, you are
not at Stuttgart on the proving grounds.


Closing comments:   

This 928 secret was revealed to me by Mark Anderson at 928 International
and I thank him for sharing this info.  I used my GT as the test mule
here and caution you to observe all safety recommendations.  

Devek performed testing with me also and has solderless procedures for
GTS-spec 928s which may work on GT-spec cars also.  

I highly recommend you contact either 928 International or Devek
Performance before proceeding in case there are updated instructions.
