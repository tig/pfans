Phew, it seems like I've gotten 50 emails in the past two days, mostly
people saying it sucks to be me, and also people urging me to stay with the
928. I decided to keep it, no matter what. But there are a couple options,
I can fix it back up (with the S4 strosek nose) and just send it back to
Greece. Or I can pull the insurance off it, fix it slowly, and take the
time to make it a 200 mph demon, then send it to Europe (and post pictures
of "Bad Boy II: The Legend Continues" online, of course), meanwhile driving
the boxster daily.

Anyway, I found a group in Canada that makes shock tower cross-braces for
928s. I've been told it is a very high quality product, so I ordered one,
will post my thoughts when I get it (and when my car is done...again)

Also, I'm going to do another complete repaint, because I want perfect
color matchup. I am going to strip all the point down by having it
sandblasted and will have it painted a pearl yellow. 928 Bad Boy will be
back better than ever!
