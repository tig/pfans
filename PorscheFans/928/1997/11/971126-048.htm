Brian:

Because of the previous problems with the dealer ( R&R AC with 
freon-$247, only to fail one month later; problems with 
appointments and timely service related to not ordering parts 
ahead of time, stock orders for parts adding days to the 
repair,etc) but  mostly because of a well placed conversation 
with the district service manager- Steve Riley from PCNA, they 
held the cost to the original estimate $200 labor and $70 parts 
for the central vent. The cost would have been 9+ hours at 
$68/hour plus the bellows and other parts ($200+) which would 
have been unreasonable. 

The Dealer also put me in a rent-a-car plus insurance at their 
cost but sad to say, it took 8 days (Tues-Weds following).
This problem is difficult from the standpoint of what to do with
a difficult to diagnose problem which may require substantial 
labor to track down. That is why the porsche dealer relies on 
algorithims and troubleshooting methods to "predict" the 
problem. Not unlike a physcian, I can tell you.


I think that if you have a medium to long standing relationship 
with your service provider, and have accrued some goodwill, a 
reasonable thing to do would be to pay for the parts but not 
(some, all, or between) of the labor costs-- if they cannot 
accuratley fix the problem. Duplicate work, or work not fixing 
the original complaint, should be credited in some form, to work 
needed.

I don't expect "fast food service" because (we) aren't driving a 
mass produced "fast food " car. I expect delays and problems in 
service and even problems getting parts quickly. But if I pay a 
premium price (PCNA Dealer) I expect premium service and 
consideration.In many ways, since this car is my daily driver, I 
am willing to do so. However, I am considering a 1980-1982 928 
to play with and that car would be my responsiblity. 

Lastly, if your shop, independent, or Dealer cannot  fix the 
problem in a timely and  correct manner, it is time to move on.

I would be curious as to others experience in this area.

To those that asked about the clock light:
In my 1986 Digitial m there is, in fact, a light. This is not 
listed in the technical manual according to the dealer.
