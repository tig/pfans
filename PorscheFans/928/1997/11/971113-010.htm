I am going to pick up a 1979 928 next week and am really excited!!  It has
been lowered, has a performance chip installed, has new or nearly new; water
pump, radiator, timing belt, seals, breaks, smog pump and has been recently
painted "arrest me red".  The motor and transmission have 130 K miles but
seem in good shape.  There are no leaks and the compression is fine.  The
second gear synchro is a bit worn and lets you know about it, unless handled
just right  until warm.

My question is - is there anything in particular I should watch out for or do
in terms of preventive maintanence?  This is my first 928 and would greatly
appreciate any comments or observations made by those more experienced.
