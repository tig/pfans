How about a black as night 1000+ lb angus cow?  Sorry farmer left it 
out when it got loose, and guess who found it?  A dark road at night 
(2-lane) and just after hitting the top of the hill, there it was, 
with its buddy, hiding in the overcast, rainy darkness.  A tree to 
one side and a fence row over a dropoff on the other convinced me 
that straight was best with max braking involved.  I used to fly out 
that road in my 90 Mustang 5.0 (I know, I know), and was luckily 
taking it easy that night.  The impact was at about 35 and it was a 
head on hit to the cow--he stared his death down.  It went into the 
hood, OVER the car leaving hoof marks on the roof, busted the rear 
spoiler, and ended up beside my right front tire.  Was a little over 
5K in damage to the car (almost 1,000 of that being airbag and 
related).  I try to take it much easier at night as where I live 
(East TN), there are many deer that can be seen at night on either 
side of the road or jumping across in front of you, and before this 
year, it was rare.  Much more common now.  Not a nice thing to do.
