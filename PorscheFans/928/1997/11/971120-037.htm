Brake proportioning is all about weight transfer and traction.

Let's assume a reasonably competent driver, who is not going to allow
BOTH ends to lock up, at least for very long...also, who will ease into
the brakes over 1/2 second or so, rather than hammering them (before
weight transfer happens...i.e. locking the fronts).

While 928s' weight distribution is about 50/50 steady-state, it's not
going to be true when either accelerating or braking (this of course
applies to any vehicle).  If you have enough traction at the front
wheels, you can change that weight distribution under braking to 0%
rear/100% front, i.e. lift the rear wheels (granted this requires
fantastic, imaginary tires).  Motorcycles can do this...most racers will
pick the rear wheel slightly off the ground when braking at the end of a
long straight (even a fat-ass 202lb-er like me!).

If you're braking very hard, more of the car's weight is transferred to
the front of the car, which means that the front tires have more
traction (and the rears have less), so you can't allow the rear brakes
to grab nearly as hard, else they'll lock the rear wheels.  Thus, you
want the bias to be heavily front-weighted.

If you're not braking very hard, and want to make the front brake pads
last longer, you can shift the bias rearwards a bit, since you're not
standing the car on its nose with the brakes, hence the rears have some
weight on them and can help slow the car.

If you're braking in low-traction conditions, such as wet or snowy
pavement, or gravel, you also want more rear bias, since you can't
transfer nearly as much weight to the fronts before they start to lose
traction and slide.

So the proportioning set up by any factory is going to be based on a
number of conditions:

 - how the car is expected to be driven (racing vs. street performance
vs. commuter)
 - how important long pad life is to the expected consumer
 - the kinds of conditions (rain, snow, etc.) expected for this car
(Subarus probably brave the snow more than Porsches!)
 - the traction levels of the tires the factory mounts (or expects
consumers to mount)

Early 928s have a tendency to lock the rears under heavy braking.  My
guess is that Porsche expected the car to be more of an all-weather car
than 911s, and also the tires we're mounting on them now have better
traction than 15 years ago, and so we are using the brakes harder, thus
pitching more weight to the front, and unloading the rears more, so they
slide.

Of course, ABS solves the whole deal by watching for locking wheels!
