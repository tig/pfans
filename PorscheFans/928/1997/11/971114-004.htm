|  No, on the front, it's supplemental to the factory unit, I think it's
|  designed by Dr. Clyde Kwok, I'll find out.


Cool - I've heard about this and am interested in the details too.  Jim
was going to cook up a triangulating brace but don't know where that
stands.  I haven't noticed a whole lot of body flex but then I'm not
running phat sway bars & suspension *yet* heh heh!

The stock bar is body mounted isn't it?  In any event, though it looks
like a solid hunk of metal, it is actually a featherweight piece and
polishes quite nicely once you remove the paint.  (the purists are
gagging right now but you could always buy a spare, stock bar for
spare/concours).

Stones in concert this weekend!  I just need tickets :]

ps.  Right on Paul keepin' the 928 faith!  Did the wing go already?
