On the L-Jetronic cars the sensor just goes to the injection computer
(yellow) and ground (brown). Ignition is still mechanically timed.
So the injection would certainly be running in a weird region with
20K ohms in series. I don't suppose it might be wired across the
sensor, i. e. in parallel? That would be a litle more reasonable,
would make the injection controller think that the engine was a
little warmer than it actually was.

The PO (or his mechanic) strikes again!
