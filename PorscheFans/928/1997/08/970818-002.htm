I had identical problems with my 78. Cold starts were great, warm starts
within a few minutes of stopping were fine, but warm starts more than 15
or 20 minutes after stopping were nearly a no-go. Acted like it was
heavily flooded - would only start if I held the accelerator to the
floor and kept cranking, then it would sputter and belch for a minute or
so until it 'cleared'.

I replaced the fuel accumulator and never looked back. I believe I saw
this solution as a Tech-Tip in the Automotion catalog. As I understand
it, the accumulator holds the fuel in the lines at pressure when the
engine is not running. This prevents fuel from vaporizing from the
standing heat of the engine and causing vapor lock.

I don't think later 928's had accumulators, but I'm not sure when they
stopped using them.
