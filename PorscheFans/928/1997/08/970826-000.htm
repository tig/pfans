Nice sentimental point Chris, but have you ever heard of beating a dead
horse?  I am sure there are many 928's out there whose _ONLY_ chance to
be driven and not scrapped is a Spyder conversion, widebody kit, total
interior re-work, or to become a track car.  I myself have one of the
many cars that, no matter how much I try, will never be original.  Not
without spending more than a newer GT would cost!!  Yes, the people who
take a running/driving car and part it out to make a buck bother me, but
that's economics.  Personally, I would love a Spyder or a Carelli-like
convertable, but I just don't have the ___ to cut the top off my
car...... (so I'll just spring it, cam it, pipe it, wing it, paint it,
stuff 17'' s under it and DRIVE IT!!)
(Please understand this is only my .02 and I do _so_ rarely get up on a
soapbox)
((btw there's a MG Midget 'round here with a Grand National engine...
sounds fun!, no?))
