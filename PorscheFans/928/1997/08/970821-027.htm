Well, you know what they say? "If you have to ask, you can't afford it." 
That doesn't quite apply here but almost. If you don't love your Porsche it 
won't love you back. In the life cycle of the 928, more and more are 
landing in the hands of those who will love them to death.

As for practicallity? My 928S is the best grocery-shopping and computer 
hauling car I've ever owned. A 1986 VW Golf was marginally easier to place 
lots of classic paper grocery sacks in. But the nice big space flat space 
behind the rear seats is wonderful for placing computers and monitors. The 
big hatch doesn't hurt.

My most memorable trip in my 928S came about unexpected one day. A severly 
disabled friend was in town that day for the grand tour, to visit, and to 
check up on the project we were working on (which was being designed almost 
exclusively around his needs in absense of any formal market studies. In 
hindsight we couldn't have had a better set of goals.)

That day each of us at various times escorted Daryl Smith, until it was 
time for him to go home and my turn came. Some awful GM station wagon was 
borrowed for hauling Daryl around. Daryl layed in the back seat with an 
attendant beside him. I was driving. After a couple of miles with about 40 
miles to go I realized I was getting near where my 928S was parked, and 
asked if Daryl wanted to ride in the Porsche? Daryl had quite a sense of 
humor and replied somthing to the effect, "It can't ride worse than this!" 
In transporting Daryl we had two major concerns, one is that he was 
sensitive to being jostled around, his joints were mostly stiff, his back 
totally fused. The other thing was A/C as Daryl couldn't sweat. I was 
worried about my 928S being a bit rough, and knew the A/C was below 
optimal. But it was obvious Daryl wanted to ride in the Porsche.

Due to Daryl's condition he didn't have a wheelchair, he had something they 
called a "transporter". It started life as a wheelchair but had front 
wheels from a wheelchair on all 4 corners. Daryl layed on his transporter. 
And we had to find somewhere to put the transporter in the 928S if we were 
to haul Daryl. Eventually it went in the passenger side of the front seat. 
I had to be careful when shifting else get poked.

Daryl's attendant crawled in and rode in the right rear seat. And behind 
the rear seats we used blankets and foam padding to make a nest for Daryl. 
We put his head on the left, closest to the exhaust pipe. If you haven't 
figured out, Daryl was fairly small, under 50 pounds, and about 45 years 
old at the time.

But we all fit, so we were off. Daryl loved the sound. He'd yell every few 
minutes, "How fast are we going?" I'd tell him and he'd answer, "I thought 
Porsches when faster than this!" Thought a bit about how unlikely it would 
be to get a speeding ticket if the officer saw Daryl. Also knew from prior 
trips that (fortunately) Daryl had no sense of balance (else he'd get 
awfully sick travelling) and therefore had almost no sense of how fast we 
were going other than the exhaust note and frequency of bumps. My main 
concern was for my passenger and how well we'd "packed" him.

So we were westbound on I-565 out of Huntsville, AL, on our way to Moulton. 
Being passed by semi trucks. Think the sight of Daryl under the glass of my 
hatch gave a couple of truck drivers a fright. Was careful not to let Daryl 
know until years later.

Other than being goaded, "How fast are we going?" the trip was otherwise 
uneventful. I kept looking for proper oportunities to open it up and let 
the engine sing its favorite song for Daryl. Finally ahead was the last 
turn, onto Daryl's 2-lane country road, and my last opportunity. 
Downshifted to 3rd or 4th and turned off the 4 lane highway without 
braking. Slid a little on gravel. Floored the throttle. And Daryl started 
yelling, "We're all going to be killed!" and "How fast are we going now?" I 
lied, "80 or 85" when it was more like 70. Never knew if Daryl was 
frightened or it was his huge sense of humor, probably a little of both as 
he kept asking how fast were we going.

Was going about 70 in 3rd and his head was close to the exhaust and the 
past 30 minutes he'd been listening to the exhaust at 1900 RPM and now it 
was 3500 RPM or 4000. Sure sounded fast. This only lasted 30 or 40 seconds 
before arriving at his house. Made a show of braking hard as if I missed 
his house. Actually the braking had more to do with the fact I wanted to 
crawl into his gravel driveway with 2 deep wheel ruts and my low 928S. 
Managed to straddle the ruts. Daryl's father waved us around to the back.

This was my other concern, "what would Daryl's parents think when we arrive 
in a non-station wagon?" To put it in perspective, a 40 mile trip to 
Huntsville might as well have been to Europe as far as his parents were 
concerned. We had to promise not to drive Daryl in the rain nor between 
4:30 and 6:00 PM (because they heard in the big city most traffic accidents 
happened at that time.) Much to my relief, Willard (Daryl's father) thought 
the 928S was a neat vehicle to haul Daryl in. The hatch made it easy to 
lift him in/out. Daryl said the A/C was perfect (ran full blast the whole 
way, fortunately it was cloudy as he was under the rear glass) and the ride 
was as smooth or smoother than he'd ever made the trip before. Guess I 
dodged the bumps?

Daryl died this year at 50 years old. I understand when Daryl was 
entertaining nurses in the hospital (one of his favorite pastimes) he often 
retold the story of his ride in a 928S. It was much more interesting to 
hear him tell of it.

Only regret is that I didn't have my camera that day.

If you are interested, the product we developed around Daryl can be seen at 
http://www.tbe.com/products/imperium/imperium.html. Sorry, no 928S pictures 
there, and no pictures of Daryl either.

So back to the original topic: What does "practical" have to do with it? 
You want practical? Get a station wagon. You want fond memories, get a 
Porsche.
