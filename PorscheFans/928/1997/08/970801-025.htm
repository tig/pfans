Mike,

I have this green/green Caddy convertible FS which needs paint bad, so =
I had a bit of rust repair and repaint done on the worst spot @ $!50 by =
a guy out in the country near Georgetown, here in southern Indiana: Kenny=
 Smith (812) 951-2795. He is a body shop employee who also has his own =
place on the side. He did OK on my repair, and he told me:

"I used to work at a Chevy dealership and when they needed to replace a =
door panel or other upholstery, the parts guys sometimes didn't bother =
to look up the color, just ordered whatever. When it came in, leather or =
vinyl, we would spray a prep on it which would open the pores. Then we =
spray-dyed it. You couldn't tell the difference."

I had heard that you can't dye to a lighter color than the original. So =
I asked Kenny about that and he said not so. So I ashed if he could dye, =
say, black, and make it, say, light yellow. He said sure. "Does it really=
 look OK?" "Yes."

He offered to redye my entire Caddy interior for about $285 in tan. Which=
, I think, compared to green would up the resale more than $285. Because =
it would match better to repaint the exterior red. I much doubt I will =
do it, because I want to get rid of it (5 cars, 4 garage slots).

After talking to Kenny, I heard elsewhere that vinyl dye would "chip off"=
, but that sounds more like paint than a stain or dye that soaks in like =
wood stain. Same guy, not an expert, told me you could buy it in spray =
cans at parts stores.

Still, I doubt dye would last as well as original, but I don't know that =
as a fact. A lot of what I have heard bad about dyes could be from experi=
ences with obsolete chemistry, or cheap brush or spray-can jobs.

Will
