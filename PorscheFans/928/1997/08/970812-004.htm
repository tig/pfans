Ah, Stephane, we owners of pre-85 US cars were trusted by Porsche
to do the right thing, so our cars are not encumbered by such
intrusive devices as your officious rev-limiter.

Seriously, I'm somewhat torn about rev limiters. For instance,
turn 6 at NHIS is an increasing-radius lefthander that has to 
be taken in second gear. Now, since it's opening up, you are
accelerating pretty hard all the way around it, and I find
that I'm running out of revs before I run out of turn. You
really can't shift if you're near the limit in a turn, so I
tend to run to about 6500 rpm before the track straightens
out and I can shift up. I would hate to have a rev limiter 
cutting power there; it seems that it would be upsetting to
the car (and therefore to me too). On the other hand, my
arm position there is such that I can't really see the
tach anyway, so maybe a series of upshift lights a la the
F1 cars would be best.
