Hey, Gang!

I have a =9178 928, and regardless of the drag coefficient I=92d rather w=
alk from
Phoenix to El Lay than own a Hyundai.  Didn=92t Saturn do a similarly poi=
ntless
ad referring to Porsches recently?  Had something to do with a Saturn own=
er
racing against 911=92s and winning.  Proof that winning isn=92t everythin=
g I
suppose.

I=92m sorry I missed the get-together yesterday in Belmont.  I sure hope
someone will be posting a summary of how things went so I can wallow in
guilt, shame, and remorse...

To Mr. Easley=92s post, I think the T-shirt idea sounds great.  If anyone=
 still
has the =9350 Ways...=94 piece and would care to repost I=92d appreciate =
seeing it.

One other thing- I=92d heard awhile ago that Porsche engineers fitted a G=
olf
with the 928 engine, transaxle, and torque tube.  This was done early in =
the
design stage of the 928 for use in testing the combination without giving
away the design of the body.  The Golf was used because it had a large en=
gine
compartment.  I think this test car was subsequently written up in either
Road & Track or Car & Driver.
