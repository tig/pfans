<<I love the original 928 styling, but a few weeks ago I passed (the 928's

driver obviously wasn't in a rush) a white '87+ 928 on I-95, somewhere near

I-495 (I'm talking metro Washington DC area here), and it was a beautiful

sight to behold--I've become much more comfortable with the new styling.  I

don't suppose this car belongs to someone from the list?>>

Oregon plates, it was me.  Probably was not though.  I was on my way back
from Milwaukie a couple of weeks ago, and go straight down 495 to 95 on my
way home.  I was also in town, staying downtown on the capitol, and drinking
in Georgetown the last two days.  See any recently?

'89 was first for trip, I play with it often.  LSD was option for awhile, and
why care about the clutch if you want an auto?  ABS option in '85, standard
in '86.  No major changes, just some new curves and bulges for the GT and
GTS.  New rear panel, see 928 Int'l ads for example, for the GTS.

Good luck, and stop by Williamsburg next sunday to visit.
