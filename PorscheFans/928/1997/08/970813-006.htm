The  tail light warning sensor is very sensitive to bulb wattage. Be sure
you have the Factory-specified wattage bulbs in your taillights.

If that checks out, you may have some resistance in one or more bulb
sockets (as you described cleaning out electrical contacts). More cleaning
or replacement may be called for.

Mine too. Tell us the solution when you fix it, please.
