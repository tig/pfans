"Idle speed on an 85 should remain the same, because your system
has an idle stabilizer.   If it is dying when first started, then your 
head
temperature sensor probably is giving you a slightly leaner mixture
than the engine needs.   Time for some diagnosis."

Thanks for the response. Head temperature sensor???? You must be an ex 
air cooled owner. This sensor is generally referred to as the Temp II 
sensor on water cooled motors. Mine checks out just fine. Wished it 
didn't really as I'm starting to grasp at straws to figure this one out. 
Your right about the mixture being too lean. If I disconnect the temp II 
sensor and fool the injector computer into thinking its real cold the car 
starts and runs like a champ for a while. There has to be a vacuum leak 
somewhere. More digging at the weekend I guess. Anyone taken the throttle 
body off? Will it slip out without removing one or both intake manifolds?
