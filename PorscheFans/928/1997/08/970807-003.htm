	Hi ,

Since there is such excitement going round about a Gullwing 928, I just
want to add my part on it too.

The silver one mentioned in this digest several times now is not a one
off.  There is a second one.  The thing they have in common is that they
were both made for Japanese business man, or salary man as they call
themselves.  This second one was done in 1989 by 2 famous German
customizers, being Hahn and Strosek.  We probably all know these guys.
As a base for this Gullwing a '89 928S4 automatic was used, no airbags.

Why the hell are these airbags so important anyway, unless you have the
intention to drive your car against a tree or something, or leave to
little room between the person in front of you;-);-).

Anyway, to come back to the Gullwing.  The Japanese salary man it was
intended for was, or still is, a disco owner in the famous or infamous
entertainment Tokyo district Ropongi.  Anyone who's ever been in Tokyo
will know this district.  Believe it or not, but the only reason this
guy wanted it was to park it in front of his disco and show it off to
the people visiting.  But then again, Japanese man have always been
posers.  I've even seen it once, the first time I visited there, I can
therefore tell you, in 1993 it was still cruising around Tokyo.

But seriously, it was the most beautiful car I've ever seen, the only
thing I was discusted about was the interiour.  It was bright red
leather.  This guy has no taste at all.  The car itself was black
metallic, was lowered, had wider tires, completely closed black rim
covers , tuned engine, changed hood with air intakes as you also see
them on the Ferrari F-40 (The air intakes were positioned where the air
intake hozes from the engines air box end up on top of the radiator),
the only good looking rear spoiler ever seen for a 928, a special small
n-shaped spoiler just over the width of the top part of the window in
the rear hatch.  To keep it short, it was drop dead georgious.  Apart
for the Gullwing doors, there were no big chances done to the car.  It
was just right or civilized if you want to call it that, and not over
done, as you see so often with customized cars.

Its a car like there is no second and there will never be.


All the best,

PS:  Anyone out there that might have some answers on the earlier
message I posted about 2 electrical problems.
