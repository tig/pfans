Hi All,

  I've mentioned before that I've had an intermitent starting problem
  with my '83 for quite some time.  The car will always start eventually,
  but I usually have to crank it quite a bit (3 or 4 ten second cranking 
  intervals) and try a few "tricks" before that happens.  In all cases,
  the fuel pump does not turn on when the car won't start.  As soon as
  the pump turns on, the car will start.  I've already replaced the fuel
  pump relay, but this didn't make any difference.  I can jumper around
  the pump relay and hear the pump run, so I feel confident that the pump
  and associated wiring is o.k..
  
  As far as the "tricks", here's what I've tried with varying luck at 
  different times.  None of these tricks have made the car start each
  time I try them, so I haven't been able to isolate any particular bad
  component.
    1) jumper around the fuel pump relay
    2) remove the air filter and slightly depress the flap on the air
       flow meter while cranking
    3) jumper across Temp Sensor II
  
  On Monday night, the no-start problem hit hard and the car (for the first
  time) would not start at all, despite trying my usual tricks.  John
  Stapelton had mentioned the possibility of an open circuit in the 
  distributor (archives July 27) and David Bigelow had written up some good 
  suggestions back on April 15, so I decided I would dive in once again to
  debug the problem.  The first thing I did was to remove a spark plug to
  verify that I was getting spark.  I kept the plug in the wire and grounded
  the plug against the front strut brace while my wife cranked the engine.
  As soon as she started cranking, I saw a spark, heard the fuel pump turn
  on, and the engine wanted to start!  I reinstalled the spark plug and the
  car started right up!
  
  Can anyone tell from this account what might be wrong?  Could the symptoms
  indicate poor ground connections or what?
  
  A simple question for other L-Jetronic owners: can you hear your fuel
  pump turn on just before your car starts?  Mine isn't unusually loud
  or anything, I'm just very tuned in to whether or not it is pumping 
  when I try to start the car.
  
  I'm baffled... As usual, any help would be appreciated.
