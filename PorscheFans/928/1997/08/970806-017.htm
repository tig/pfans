I also saw this one on the PCD.  It happens to be a car I flew to
Houston to look at in January.  Needless to say the car was claimed to
be in great condition or I wouldn't have flown so far to see it.  It was
rebuilt from the front bumper back to the windshield.  It also had minor
work on the sides and rear end.  It was leaking oil, ATF, and power
steering fluid.  The title was not in the name of the person selling it,
and I heard various stories as to its origin.  It had 63K when I looked
at it then, and the asking was $13,000 or so.  I think it has changed
hands, or someone else is working on selling it now.  

<<1987 PORSCHE 928, WHITE, blue lea., 68000 MILES, exc. body & interior,
needs minor work, $8900 nego., 713-461-3836., TX.>>

I would HIGHLY advise that you stay away.  I know it looks attractive,
but I conservatively estimated that it would take at least $5000, and
probably more like $7000 to put it back together again right and to
paint it.  The fenders were rebuilt poorly, and becuase of that the hood
doesn't even come close to fitting, and various mounts for the radiator
etc. aren't right.  It needs a complete repaint, and lots of minor (at
best) engine work.  

On the other hand, it is now cheap.  Much cheaper than when I saw it. 
It does have a clean title, and the engine is strong.  The transmission
shifts well, and the interior is in good shape.  It even has 12 way
seats instead of 8 (rare in my experience).  I know someone was looking
for a project, and this could convievably be it.  On the other hand if
you aren't looking for a project, steer well clear.  And at the very
least email me if you want more info.  I would be happy to pass it
along, and then see that the money I spent looking wasn't wasted.
