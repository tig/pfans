  I find it interesting that you're able to diconnect Temp Sensor II and
  the car will still run.  On my '83 (L-Jetronic), if Temp Sensor II is
  disconnected, the car _will not_ start.  If the sensor is disconnected
  while the car is running, the engine dies immediately.
  
  I guess the LH-Jetronic cars have a limp-home mode in fuel/ignition 
  computers that allow the car to run without Temp Sensor II(?)  Or could
  it be that _since_ the car still runs without the sensor, this is indicative
  of a short in the wiring such that the computers believe they are really 
  receiving a signal from the sensor?  If I recall correctly, resistance in the 
  sensor is high (10-14K ohms) for a cold engine and approaches 0 (actually
  200-300 ohms) as the engine warms.  Wouldn't a short provide essentially
  0 ohms and therefore make the computers think the engine was warmed up and 
  therefore lean out the mixture?
