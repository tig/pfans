........okay........I gotta continue the theme......
I've got one (Mountaineer), and had one before having one was cool
(about 15 years running, now).  As to speculation regarding this common
thread, hmmmmmm........how 'bout a top ten?:

    10.    If you can't outrun 'em in the 928, then you can SQUASH
'em!    tehetehethee
      9.    Deer strapped onto the hatch glass during hunting season
tend to slide in tight turns.
      8.    928 sits too low, and hole in rear bumper cover ruins the
aerodynamic efficiancy when a
             a trailer hitch is installed.
      7.    Hey.......with a 928 as collateral.......you can buy
whatever you please!
      6.    It's more interesting pulling doughnuts in an SUV during
snow/ice/chance of rain.
      5.    Adds security during fits of road rage.
      4.    Frees you up to sctratch your privates, spit snuff into
styrofoam cups, and let loose with any
             other bodily functions without denegrating the gentile
nature of the 928.
      3.    Easier to ingress and egress an SUV while wearing a ball
cap, torn T-shirt, and muddy
             hiking boots (required male garb here in Indiana).
      2.    For 928/SUV owners that are women - provides a decoy
allowing potential dates/mates
             necessary time to detect possible testoterone poisoning or
knuckle-dragging.
      1.    We gotta have something to fetch parts if our 928 runs hot,
slips the shifter ball-n-socket,
             explodes behind the driver's seat, or wheels fall off due
to miscalculation of tire/wheel
             offset!      :{)

May you all have a wonderful day and your 928 perform flawlessly!
