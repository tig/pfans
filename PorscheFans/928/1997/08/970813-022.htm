 Yes. One of my Euro-engines is an '85 (2-valve); it had
dual-distributors that were chain/sprocket coupled. And if I remember
correctly, it could be retro-fit on any earlier block, as well. It is
available to sell, as I replaced it (and the OE computer) with an
Electromotive TEC-II fuel-management/ignition system. 
 (BTW, those boxes are *current* amplifiers for the coils.  CDI systems
store their energy for the spark discharge in a capacitor, where as
others
store it in the inductance of the HV coil itself.)
