You bought manuals before buying the car? Makes great sense to me. Wish
I'd done that. Found the manuals are excellent things to read at night
to put yourself to sleep.

Then when shopping for a car, you know more than most anyone else about
what's inside. Its fun to see the components in real life for a change.

Then when you see that "fixer-upper" you have visions of its parts spread
through out your house and garage, it turns your stomach, so you pay
extra for a nice healthy car you can enjoy and save more in the long run.

Of course keeping the manuals might *cause* you to buy a 928.

Maybe its time I repost my "What does "practical" have to do with it?"
message which hit this list at a bad moment?
