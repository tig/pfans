Colin,

  I don't have any experience with the LH-Jetronic, so I won't be able
  to offer answers to those specific questions.  Regarding the cooling fan, 
  however, here is a response that John C. C. White had sent out on this 
  issue back in May.  (BTW, last year I replaced the switch coolant temperature
  switch on my '83 (on the lower right front of the radiator) with one that 
  would turn the electric fan on at a lower temp.  For months, the fan never 
  turned on when the temp gauge indicated that the fan was needed.  Suddenly
  and without me making any other changes, the fan started working as it
  should and has been fine ever since.  Very strange...)

The electric fan is controlled by two switches in parallel: the
coolant temperature switch and the refrigerant temperature switch.
If either temperature is high enough, the fan relay is picked and
the fan goes on. So you may find that the fan goes on if you're
running the A/C, even if the coolant temp isn't that high. It may
be that you have a bad coolant temp switch, if the fan doesn't
go on with the coolant temperature really high - the challenge is
to figure out which of the many temperature sensors is the one
that controls the fan.
