Here is a plug for Red Line and Water Wetter. I called the 800# posted on 
this list last week to find the nearest retail source for WW. Believe it or 
not, all Pep Boys carry the stuff and both of my local stores had it in 
stock. Bought a pint and put it in my '84S.

The next day I had to drive my car approximately 200 miles round trip. In 
the past, the needle stayed centered on the guage. Now it stays just over 
the lower white line while driving at highway speeds. This was on a 90+ 
degree day with the A/C on. In the city my car would generally inch up 
toward the upper white mark, the secondary fan would then kick on 
maintaining that temp. With WW, in traffic w/ the A/C and 90 degree weather, 
my car seems to be holding a temperature 1/2 between the mid-point and the 
upper white mark.

An added benefit, it seems that the cooler the car is running, the colder 
the A/C blows. I may be imagining this, but hey, perception is everything, 
isn't it?

Needless to say, I am very impressed w/ this product. So much so, that I 
went and bought another pint to try in my SUV. I hope it works as well 
there.
