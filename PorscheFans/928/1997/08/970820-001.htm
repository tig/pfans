Nelson,

How much are you asking for your wheels?  Are you willing to split the set?
 Are they the silver w/ clear coat like the '87-88 wheels?

I have an almost perfect set...I mucked up the finish on one of my rears a
little bit however and have been looking for a trade out deal w/ another
rear...like if someone wanted to have a set chromed, then my wheel would be
fine...if someone wanted a wheel for racing fine...just for driving no one
will notice...a wheel for concours events....NOT!  I mean it is not terrible,
it is just not perfect anymore and no one has any refinishing solutions and
all Wheel Enhancements and Robert Wood want to do is do an exchange
SET...NOT!

Sorry this is so long just wanted you to understand my delima and see if you
could help.

BTW your email address did not show up so that is why I am posting this to
the list.
