Ken,
Let me get this straight, you want to go +3!  The first question is
why?  If it's looks, then I can't objectively argue with you.  However,
let me point out, that when you go from 15 to 17" wheels, your tiny
brake discs will look pretty silly.  With 18's on, yikes!  There will be
>1.5" of radial clearance between the caliper and wheel.

Now, if you're doing it for performance, there is really no point as
I've been told.  You gain a lot going from 15 to 16 and a little going
from 16 to 17's but, since many DOT approved race tires aren't available
in the best 17" sizes, the 16's seem to be the wheel of choice for the
track and 17's for the street.  I think most of what you get with 17's
and 18's is a whole lot of harshness.  Those 18" tires are really
expensive too - you could get great 16's for less and do better things
with the $'s - like improving the driver for example.  If $'s aren't
your particular problem (congratulations BTW), then why not upgrade to a
GT/GTS?

My view,
Kurt
'87 S4 5sp (225/50-16 & 245/45-16 R1's)
(BTW, you actually increase your moment of inertia and your acceleration
will decrease slightly with the 18's.)
