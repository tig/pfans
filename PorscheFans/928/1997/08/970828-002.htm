Regarding the recent thread about 928 values, a couple of years ago I was
kind of down on the 928 experience after paying a large repair bill and I
took my '85 928 to a local used car lot that I had heard offered fair
prices for used cars.  They offered me $2500.  Then last night I was
tinkering on the internet at Kelley's Blue Book page and I discovered that
my fiance's 5 yr old Toyota Corolla DX is worth more than my 928.

I don't consider selling my 928 any more, though, because the more other
cars (all newer) that I drive, the more I appreciate the build quality and
performance of the 928.  It's almost magical the way it pulls through the
gears and is up to speed so quickly.  I always find the drive to and from
work takes several minutes less than when I drive my other car ('94 SHO)
without any extra effort.  And I'm almost always disappointed to have
arrived because it means the drive is over.  You can't really quantify
that, but it's worth a lot.
