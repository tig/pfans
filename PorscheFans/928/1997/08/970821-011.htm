Colin,

  Could it be that you may have finally explained my occasional no-start 
  problem?!  I've been keeping mental records of when the car does and 
  doesn't start and I had arrived at the conclusion a while ago that it was 
  temperature related.  That's what had initially led me to check the values
  on Temp Sensor II (which turned out to be within spec) - but I measured 
  directly off the sensor, not at the end points of the wiring harness.
  I'm still looking into my problem from a fuel supply perspective, but
  A. Radcliff had also suggested checking the ignition control unit.  If
  the brown wire with the spliced-in resistor goes to that unit, then
  maybe I've found my problem?!  I'm anxious to check the wiring diagrams
  when I get home...
  
  Thanks a bunch for the very detailed response.
