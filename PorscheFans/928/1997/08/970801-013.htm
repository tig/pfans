This reminds me of one of my first (non-direct) experiences with a 928.
Summer of 1979, I had fallen in love with 928's almost a year earlier,
but hadn't seen a 'live' one yet. I was returning home from Grand Rapids
Michigan (I lived in Southern Ontario, Canada at the time). I was
driving my 74 Mazda RX4 at hyperspeeds though an unbelievable downpour.
There was literally half an inch of water on all standing surfaces. Out
of the mist, from behind, came an eerie silver ghost - a 79 928 doing
hyperspeed+1. I moved over into the slow lane and let him slowly slide
by me as I took in every detail of the land sharks exterior. I then
matched his speed and followed him for the next 40 miles until he
flashed his taillights at me and exited the highway. What struck me most
was the aerodynamics of the car. The rain caught in the draft behind his
car was not in a maelstrom of disarray, but was flowing gracefully down
off the tail, then upwards as it met the pavement. Behind the rear tires
there were two perfectly symetrical horizontal 'tornados' of rain, one
for each tire, rotating in the opposite directions. A thing of beauty...
