<<Brian,

Tell me about the White '87...is it an auto?  Need and auto.  If it is not
auto then nothing else matters.>>

It is an auto.  Seems to shift properly, smooth, right RPM's when you sit on
the throttle.  Maybe a little hard shifting at the high RPM's.

<<Here is what I am interested in doing and I do understand the cost of all
of the work to get it done, but I am insane and I think it would be cool to
have:

-wide body kit
-total change of paint color...to Riviera blue or Meritime blue
-Weltmiester comp/racing sus
-4 or 5 point harnesses
-racing seats
-supercharged motor
-obviously wide wheels to fill in the wide body

Would this be a good donar car for that?>>

With all that in mind I really do think it would be a good donor car.  You
would be replacing the fenders front and rear, right?  This is the major
problem area.  The hood looked proper, the fenders looked wrong.  The front
fascia is proper, the mounting points for radiator, etc., are cobbed together
with body filler.  This could all be fixed pretty easily when you did the
conversion.  Supercharge the motor, and you should pull it and do the head
gasket anyway.  So you could fix the leaks and whatever else came your way
when you had it out.  

<<What it would require is a good motor to start w/, good tranny all the way
back, good running gear (obviously shocks/springs could be shot, as well as
dinged wheels and used tires).  Prefer a good interior so I could save that
for last, and preferably poor paint/body because I would hate to take a
perfectly good car and strip it down for repaint.>>

Sounds like it might meet the above.  I didn't have it inspected, I do my own
inspections.  I didn't get to the mechanicals of the engine and the tranny,
because the body work wouldn't pass for me.  Interior is generally good.  I
think I might remembera couple of cracks in the dash.  Navy blue interior, by
the way. Same Identical car I have now, Gran Prixe white, and navy.  I found
the current one when this one fell through and I flew to Dallas to visit my
brother.  So it wasn't all bad.  

<<What do you think?  I am in Austin, TX so I could probably check this car
out w/o to much trouble and take my 928 mechanic w/ me to check on some of
the mechanicals.  What do you think they would take for it based on what you
know?

Looking forward to hearing back on this one....>>

I think if you are in Austin you should a) call the seller and talk first. I
am almost postive that it is the same car, but it may not be., b) ask them
what they would take realistically, I believe that would probably go as low
as $8K based on the price now.  This car may be different, I doubt it though,
and it may have additional problems since I saw it in Feb.  I know it was
advertised through most of the spring, again in the beg of summer, and now I
see it again.
