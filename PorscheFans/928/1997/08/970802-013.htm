<<What I've experienced:

'84 S,  oil unknown 1.5 bar idle, 5 bar normal speeds

'84 S,  Castrol synthetic 2  bar idle, 5 bar normal  (20 - 50wt)



'90 GT,  oil unknown 2 bar idle, 5 bar normal

'90 GT,  Mobil 1 2.5 bar idle, 5 bar normal (15 - 50wt)



With near 2 gallons of oil in the case, it takes awhile to heat to

operating range.  During that time, pressure stays 5 bar (of course).

When the water temp reads slightly above half, then pressure starts to

come down to 4 bar, etc.    Putting fresh oil in the car is one of my

favorites so I don't mind  frequent changes (but should start driving

the car less now - I've put miles on it already! Ahh, summer!).

I just fixed my oil pressure sending unit.  I remember a lot of talk about
this a couple of months ago.  Instead of replacing it, I just knocked it
gently to loosen any "stuff" in the galleys , then removed the harness and
sprayed it and the sending unit with brake clean.  I reinstalled and finished
the oil change with Mobil 1 15W-50 (On Sale at K-Mart for $3.60 quart, plus
$3.60 rebate on a case).  The guage works fine now.  I believe it was all of
the crud on the harness contacts. It runs 5.0 bar at warmup, then in gear it
wil fall to about 2.5 bar.  From 800 RPM upt to about 1300 RPM it climbs
gradually, above 1500 it is pegged.  I know this may be late (I still haven't
read all the digests from last week.
