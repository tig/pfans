Well, my 930 is catalyst exempt since it is a 79, but the 928 was very simple
to do.  I irdered a Bursch test pipe (for off road use only) from
EuroProducts (who I would highly recommend) and unbolted the catalytic
conmverters.  As some of you know my 928 is in like new condition and doesn't
get driven in rain, so rust was not a problem.  The bolts came out and the
cat pipe came right off.  The oxygen sensors even screwed into the Bursch
pipe.  That mod and the AutoThority computer chips are the best thing I ever
did to the car perfromance-wise.
Good luck and be careful with the torch!
