Nelson and LL,

I have about the same experience as LL it that my car rarely gets hot.  There
have been a couple of occasions this summer where it has got hotter than
normal (normal being about half way up the gauge) but a little bit of out of
the traffic driving and down came the temp.

Have you tried any water wetter...there was talk about its benefits awhile
back.  I am keen to give it a shot but have not found it anywhere.

Does anyone have any ideas on a good paint cleaner and polish protectant/wax?
 I am going to try the Meguire's Medallion series to see.  I looked at the
one of the local PCA web pages after I had already bought the stuff, they
recomended a 3M product...maybe try that next time.

TIA,
