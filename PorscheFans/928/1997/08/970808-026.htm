Hi folks,
Just an example of Porsche service here in Europe for you...
Today I called my local Porsche dealer to make a date to get my emmissions
checked, the guy said "why do you want to do that"?
I said because I think my car is running a little rich and I want to check
it out.
He says "OK"
I say  "ok can I come someday next week"
He says " Oh no you can only come on the 18 or 19 September"
I say "you're joking"
He says "No we're very busy"
I say "can I not come along and if you have five minutes we could quickly do it"
He says "No No it takes much longer than that cause you must take the bottom
engine covers and lots of stuff off to check this out"
I say "thank you very much I'll find another way, goodbye".

Marveous EH?

Just finished putting a pair of CUP Mirrors on my S4 ..beautiful..



By the way....
