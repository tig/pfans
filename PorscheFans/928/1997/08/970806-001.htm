I'm not sure what injection system a USA '85 has, but I used to have an
intermittent starting problem with my '83 Euro 928S. Invariably it would
refuse to start _only_ when there was a family nearby  with a kid saying
"look Daddy, a Porsche".

My Porsche mechanic told me it was most likely to be a dicky fuel pump
relay, so whenever it happened, Sally-Ann would have to pull her legs up
onto her seat and I'd be down in the passenger foot well jiggling relays,
usually to no avail.

After months of winning the "Most embarrassing 928 problem" award, I
finally tracked down the problem.

The K-Jetronic system has a "warm-up control" unit mounted near the oil
filler. This has two wires connecting to it. The connector has a
right-angle rubber boot on it to waterproof the connection. This boot was
split, and water had entered and corroded the connections causing the
intermittent problem.

A quick clean-up of the connectors and then liberal silicon sealant has
fixed up the problem. I now no longer dread parking on the main street of
town.

Cheers,

Andy - '83 EURO S, (rubinrotmettalic) complete with two Doberman's sitting
in the rear.
