The thread about ignition switch and occasional starting troubles:

I had exact symptoms on my '79 Euro and took entire
switch/tumbler/column lock mechanism apart.  The back of key/tumbler
component engages a small eccentric that actuates the steering wheel
lock mechanism.  This piece sits inside the steering stalk and is
removed toward the tumbler side after key switch is pulled out.  It is
about three inches long, has the eccentric disk (about and inch in
diameter and the disk looks to be nylon-like) with a very small coil
spring.  The flat rod through this eccentric makes the mechanical
connection into the electrical switch which is screwed from the backside
of the whole assembly and is easily accessed after pod removal.  The
ignition harness/pigtail plugs onto this electrical switch.  Even though
I wound up replacing every component.....the culprit turned out to be
that little eccentric piece.  The ignition tumbler pawl and  eccentric
are aluminum - with the result that over time and usage, the aluminum
wears away enough that twisting the key cannot always result in enough
rotation through the assembly to make the electrical switch on the back
end to work properly (WHEW!).

Also.....the design of the electrical switch is such that it can only
turn into 'start' position once - then the key must return to 'off'
before another attempt at starting (prevents possibility of engaging
starter while engine is running).

My car has about 130k miles......and that little component (eccentric)
is the only one that actually showed significant wear.  You will find
928International very knowledgeable and helpful with further advice or
parts.

BTW......everything Vince Yu wrote is accurate.....this is just
additional info.

Good luck - let us know what you find!     :{)
