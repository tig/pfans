Although this isn't much of a 'thread', it might help a few of you out
there.   Just to redux my info:  I'm restoring a beat '79 Euro model.
At the moment STILL waiting (grrrrrrrrrrrr) to get the body back from
the body shop getting a new coat.   It was stripped to bare metal - in
my garage - using about three gallons of Aircraft stripper and two sets
of lungs for moi.  Engine is out and has been rebuilt requiring new
rings and bearings.  Engine had extremely low amount of wear considering
the very poor POs and obvious abuse.  Interior is pretty ratty, but
being reassembled/repaired as I go.   All the glass is out, and I'm
replacing the pod and dash with uncracked units from recycle yards.
So.........to share what I've found and to offer opinions:

    1.    As a part reference, the EuroSelect part book is available and
sells for roughly $25 through 928International.    The Porsche 'Parts
and Technical Reference Catalog' (part number PNA-001-147-A) for water
cooled models (1977 -1988) sells for $9.95 through MYPorsche out of
Seaside, California.  It is the IDENTICAL catalog, folks!   My friends
at 928International have been terrific and I will continue to rely on
them for many items, but the reality is that at least this handy
reference is available at considerable savings.
    2.    I got Porsche part number 477-898-011A to install my
windshield.  It is the correct kit for windshield and back glass
sealing/bonding........sells for about $120 through Porsche.  It looked
familiar.......hmmmmmmmm........rummaging through my 'stuff', found
universal seal kit from 3M used in one of my domestic cars.  Holy smokes
- they are IDENTICAL!  The 3M part is #08611 (Ribbon Sealer) and sells
for about $10.  Even the glass standoffs are identical in both kits!
The Porsche kit does, however, include two teeny vials of glass cleaner
to prep the edges - but acetone (for example) works perfectly.
    2.    Re:  the saga to fill transmission oil.  I use a hand pump
purchased from most any discount auto parts store for $5 to $10 to pump
the fluid from bottle to filler hole.  The kit I got came with ample
hoses that easily fit to the inlet and outlet of the pump.  It's the
most effective thing I've used yet.
    3.    Re:  the PPG paint (two pack process) thread.  My car will be
painted with that system.   My reasoning was that it gives a great
appearance, has the lifetime warranty, and takes advantage of latest
technology (ie. UV reduction).  Downside is that it is not as readily
touched up, so there are tradeoffs.  Last fall, I had another vehicle
painted with that system with great results - but time is the real test
and I cannot testify how it will look in five or ten years.  As we all
know, the talent of the shop and proper prep are most critical.
    4.    When investigating what to do with my block, I had trouble
finding anyone competent with that design.  The local specialists, all
paroled from the well-known local Porsche dealer, gave conflicting
opinions and suggestions.  I believe them to be very competent and fair,
but it was tough to determine what advice to take.   In my research, I
stumbled on a business that specializes in fork lift rebuilds.  WHAT?
you say?   Well, many of those power plants are aluminum!   A 928 owner
with too much time and money hired this guy to buy all the appropriate
Sunnen equipment to supplement his machining centers and bore/surface
his engine!  After friendly conversation, I decided he knew the
peculiarities of this design and material and in fact machined the
owner's block with success.  He offered to do mine for $50 per hole!
This is a BARGAIN!   I decided against it as my block did not require
machining.  Here in the midwest, he is the only possible resource I
could find at the time.   He is located in South Bend,
Indiana.........and if there is interest, I will be happy to post his
name and phone number.   Fortunately , I did not need his services, but
you are welcome to discuss your needs with him and decide for yourself
if he can help.
    3.    I don't remember who observed (Leonard?....Phil?......) about
the Euro exhausts.   Mine appears to be completely as originally built.
The head pipes convene into the  front muffler which has a single
outlet.  The rest of the system is single, except at the tail muffler
outlet (the two tailpipes).  All numbers seem to be correct, and the
bolts had to all be ground off ( but that may mean nothing due to fact
that this car had plenty of miles driven in the rust belt).  Should I
look at upgrading to dual at some point......or keep it as acquired (and
functional)?

HEY!   WAKE UP!!!!!   I figgered a few of you needed that at this point
-   :{)

So, that's my story for now - and I'm stickin' to it!   Because of the
project (and money) at this point, I'm gonna need some astute advice
next summer when I tear into my Cuisinart (sp?) of a 5-speed ("it
slices.....it dices......")!

PS>   I'm enjoying all the poop from you guys!
PSS>  Sorry for the length, but it's just a 'delete' button long!
