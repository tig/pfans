 Hi Tony
 
 I also have an 84 Euro spec 928 S.  The two parts you are talking about
 I beleive are the ignition signal splitters.  One operates the left
bank
 of cylinders, the other the right.  If one is unplugged, only one bank
 will fire because only one of the distributors is getting spark, due to
 one of the coils not getting a signal (I think).  For those WPO owners,
 the ZZZ 928s have one ignition computer (Bosch LH), two splitters, two
 coils, and two distributors.
 
 Have you tried 928 International?  Mark Anderson was extremely helpful
 to me when I was getting my car up to snuff.  When I bought it the poor
 thing was sitting for three years because the PO couldn't figure out
why
 it had no spark.  I didn't pay much for it, but it caught up to me!
 Computers are not cheap!!
 
 Good luck
 
 Mark
 84 Euro spec (in need of Right Front ABS Sensor, 90 tooth ring, '85
with
 optional ABS will fit also!)
