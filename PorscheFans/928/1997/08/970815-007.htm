Doug,

This happens to a lot of S4's anyway (I have check w/ many folks) and it
stems from NTW (or any other tire place) doing an alignment and not
understanding the car that they are doing it on.  What happens generally is
that the jack up the car, replace old tires w/ new ones, drop the car down
and then go to aligning it.  Have you ever looked at your car after taking it
off of a jack?  It sits about 3" higher than normal...and usually takes
several miles to settle back down...so while they use "factory" setting for
the alignment, once the car settles it is way off, so you get bad tire wear.
 One of the interesting things is that most everyone I talk to has worse wear
on the inside of the left front...not as bad but still very pronounced on rt.
front and none in the back...

Hope that helps...take your car to a place that knows how to align Porsche's
and get a new set of tires too.
