	I would eliminate the starter solenoid first.  You can do this
by verifying voltage at the solenoid hot terminal.  Check the wiring to
the solenoid next.  If the ignition switch is at fault, you need to
remove the pod to access the ignition switch assembly.  Behind the
ignition key tumbler is mounted the ignition switch assembly.  This is
the assembly you need to R&R.  It is held on with two screws.
Disconnect the wiring plug first.  You might want to replace the
ignition key assembly if there is too much play on the tumbler.
