Hi John,

Further to my last email, DEVEK's address is 248 Harbor Blvd., Belmont CA 94002.

I had to find the address on the web, as my catalog had their old address.
They moved recently.

I'm sitting here waiting for their new catalog to be released.

Congrats on your S4. (Swoon!)

I've got a Euro '83 S, but I'm hoping to be visiting the US later in the
year to get a trashed S4 or GT to ship back over here to rebuild for
racing.

Cheers!
