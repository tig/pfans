Congratulations!  Looking forward to seeing your purebred up on your
page!   Your previous experience with car conversions will certainly
help when working on the 928.

Tell you what to do with that spare V8 - clear out the garage except for
the Porsche and said drivetrain.  Keep the S4 stock & maintained
meticuously.  Find a decent donor 928, preferably 5-speed,  drop in the
spare motor and go as wild as you want with widebody, spoilers, etc.  I
will bet you'll get even deeper satisfaction from the Porsche conversion
& use, than any 'kit' car you've done so far.  From the pix on your
page, you do very nice work and will appreciate the detail and attention
gone into the design and build of the 928.  Get the book "Project 928"
if you can find it anywhere!

The 928 world is about ready to undergo a metamorphasis that we've never
seen before.  Market prices are all over the map.  Things are in flux.
We are the hardcore here.  Our aftermarket is hanging with us and even
expanding.  Definately an exciting time for all!

Hang on to your hats, fans - the big 2-1 is going to be unbelievable...
Phil
