Hi:

I've been so busy with last weekend, etc. that I forgot to give the
update...

TorqueMaster ( www.torquemaster.com ) was kind enough to send me a eval
set to report on.  They're in the car and I'll get the part no. later.
Before sending them, they required some background info to configure the
plugs for this application ie. type of ignition, current plug type, etc.

The plugs soon arrived, with many pages of tech data & dyno sheets.  One
of the TorqueMaster selling points is race or street - one plug type.
Another is very obvious, there's no need to index these plugs as the
side electrode is actually a ring around the center electrode -
therefore nothing is shrouding the spark.  There is one caveat though -
to gain maximum performance one should install bigger injectors in
conjunction with the plugs.

To give these a thorough test, I'll run completely stock as a phase I...

The plugs installed easily enough to a cold motor (important for
aluminum heads) and yes I did put hi-temp anti-seize on the threads.
TorqueMaster further recommends a die-electric insulating grease or
something to the porcelin to cut down on any emitted spark loss as high
as 25%.  I didn't have any on-hand and don't think you would either.
Maybe they should put a small tube in with the plug kit?

First impressions are (stock injectors, etc.) these plugs like a hot
motor.  I noticed some stumbling with a cold motor and on/off throttle
modulation.  Not a big deal, these are supposed to be performance plugs
so I accept little trade-off's like this.  The motor does feel decidely
'soft' low to mid rpm's.  Hi-rpm's in a GT is always exciting and my
seat isn't dyno-calibrated so I can't tell you much until I dyno it or
go to Sear's again.

Second impressions:   I thought I 'd be smart and try out that Super
104+ octance booster to see if that helped the cold motor / low rpm
situation.  Didn't.  But that stuff does turn your plugs a powdery
reddish color!  Weird huh?

Future tests hopefully will include a nice rising rate pressure
regulator, and then ultimately bigger injectors.  I have every
confidence the TorqueMaster plug makes superior horsepower in the upper
rev range.  Not earthshattering mind you, weren't not talking about
nitrous!  But enough of an edge, easily installed/reversible, smog
legal, to make them worthwhile to try.

If you do primarily short drives, or lots of city driving you may want
to stick with Bosch platinums - they're great - and save these special
plugs for the track...  I think TorqueMaster's real forte is boosting
highly modified engines ie. nitrous'd or compressed vs. standard plugs
which might not fire properly in those conditions.

Final analysis at this point:  If you've already done the big injectors,
exhaust & chip mod then you're ready to try TorqueMasters!

Phil
