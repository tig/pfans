I added daytime running lights to my 1990 S4, using the factory relay
made for this.  On the 1990, I'm not sure about other years, there is a
socket  III and the panel lists it for daytime running light relay.  I
inquired at the dealer about the relay, the parts manager told me it was
for Canadian models only.  I was told its not available to American
dealers. So I called  a Canadian dealer (Actually two) and ordered the
relay. WARNING! If you plug the relay in without removing the fuse for
the fog lights you will blow many fuses when you turn on your
headlights.  The highbeam foglights work fine. and the driving lights
switch off when you kick on the high beams like normal.  The relay that
came in is actually a Audi relay, purple in color and I guess much
cheaper at the audi dealer.  I will pull out the fuse cover tonight to
get the Audi part number if there is any interest in this.  BTW this
relay is about $40 American at the Canadian dealers.
