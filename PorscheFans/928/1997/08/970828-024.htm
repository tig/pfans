All of these accessories can work with a battery which is so dead that you
won't get even a click from the starter relay. I would try jumping the car
(use the terminal under the hood; unscrew the cute captive nut to expose
the terminal, then be careful). If you're more patient and have the
equipment, first try charging the battery through the same terminal and see
how much it draws (more than 1-2 amps means it's hungry).

If the battery is flat, check for causes: voltage regulator alive? heater
fan relay stuck closed? alternator belt slipping? battery out of water?
battery old and tired?

If the battery isn't flat, something simple (e.g., the starter cable
falling off) may have happened; don't assume that it must be something
high-tech or intrinsically expensive.
