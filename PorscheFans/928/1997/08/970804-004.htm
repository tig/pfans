Derron,

I just sent in my application to PCA, so don't have any Pano issues..

I would appreciate knowing the specific issue as I may be able to order =
a back copy. Better yet, can you scan the article and post it? Is that =
asking too much? I don't know if you can do this at work or what.

Thanks, Will
