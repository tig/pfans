Thanks.

That interconnected detector is something I hadn't thought of. We need =
them throughout the house too, so I will do that for sure.

High garage ceiling we have, @ 14' 3".

Glad you mentioned the temperature question. As it is now our hottest sea=
son here, I will put a thermometer in the garage today and keep records. =
Will put it near the ceiling. The critical time seems like a while after =
we've parked two hot cars on a hot day, ya think?
