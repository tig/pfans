Hi !
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ON THE LIST. PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR ANY MISTAKES I MIGHT
MAKE .

I HAVE A PROBLEM THAT I HOPE SOMEONE OUT THERE HAS EXPERIENCED BEFORE AND HAS
A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.

FIRST IS THAT  WHEN I AM DRIVING IN CITY TRAFFIC THE TRANSMISSION WILL SWITCH
GEARS UNDER 2,000 RPM. IS THIS NORMAL AND IF NOT CAN IT BE ADJUSTED AND HOW
DO I ADJUST IT ? 

SECOND WHEN I TAKE OFF FROM A STOP POSITION THE CAR WILL ACCELERATE UP TO
4,000 RPM AND THEN SWITCH GEARS, HOWEVER, IF
I AM IN MOTION AND TRY TO ACCELERATE IT WILL HESITATE THEN SLOWLY
GAIN SPEED. THIS HAPPENS WHEN I PUNCH THE PEDAL AND WHEN I TRY TO 
SLOWLY PUSH THE PEDAL DOWN. I WENT TO SEVERAL MECHANICS WHO TELL ME THIS IS
NORMAL .  I DON'T REMEMBER MY OLD TRANI DOING THE SAME THING. ( TRANI
REPLACED A YEAR AGO)

CAN ANYONE HELP , I AM VERY EAGER TO FIND A SOLUTION. 
THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR ANY HELP AND INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP.
.
