Yes.

Phil is playing with you, but that's Phil.

There's a question of degree here. The 928, while obviously a sporting car,
is much less flashy and visible than almost any Ferrari or many of the
current Japanese cars (e.g., the big Mitsubishi, which tries hard to look
like a Maclaren F1), most of which offer lower performance than the 928,
let alone the Dodge Viper.

My wife, I think correctly, calls the 928 a "stealth car" because it is
relatively invisible for its level of performance. This pleases me, because
I don't always want attention from those who are measuring status or those
who want to compete. I prefer, following the ancient (Chinese, I think)
dictum, to choose my battles.

So, I don't think that people buy 928s primarily to express their "posing"
impulses, but actually to use and privately enjoy them.
