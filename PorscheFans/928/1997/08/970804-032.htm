An thoughts or ideas on the 928 4 sp auto trans would be appreciated:

1.  Leak at torque converter: Assume this is the converter hub to case seal.
Anyone have experience replacing this?

2.  Second gear starts: Is that why these cars are so doggy off the line?
Anyone have experience actually modifying the valve body to allow part
throttle, normal driving first gear starts? Is it really necessary to buy a
new Euro valve body?

3. Trans overhaul: My car - a fix up project with 93k mi - seems awful sloppy
in 3rd and 4th gears. Is this worn clutch packs? Pump? 2nd gear seems tight
and fine. Do MB rebuld intrernals fit? Is there a reasonably priced after
market source?

4. How about the differential? My car is seeping lube at the RH CV
flange/diff side case. Do the transaxles last a long time, or need o'haul at
100K? How about final drive ratio? This car seems incredibly overgeared
(2:20:1). Are lower gear sets from other years readily available?

5. Torque Tube: What's your advice - should the torque tube bearings be
replaced at 93K, assuming that R&R is necessary to service the converter
seal, in any case? Are these std bearings, or application-specific/expensive?

6. Labor: Any tips on transaxle R&R? I've worked on plenty of 911's, etc, but
this is first 928 I've tackled.

Thanks in advance,

John
