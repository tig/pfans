Dear Bob: I hope to be in Williamsburg around mid afternoon on 8/24
(Sunday). I'm flexible with dinner plans or for just bending the elbow.
Since it's your stomping ground, pick a good place for my better half and me
to meet/eat/drink. Wish I could stay longer but we have previous commitments
back in northern VA for the following weekend. Looks like we'll only be in
your area till 8/27 (Wed.).

See you soon. Ed

I will be back on Saturday evening.  I have several ideas, but since I don't
know your schedule, and you don't know mine, why don't I give you my home
number and you can call me and let me know where you are staying.  Lets shoot
for Sunday early evening, say 5-7 pm.  I will forward this out to the others,
and if any of you want to call me and leave me your number I will pass the
final plans around.  If I hear from others I will pick an easy place to find.
 The prices will be fair, the quality good, and the service uncertain since
you are in tourist and college heaven.  John Ryall I know we can at least
count on you to show up, right?  I would like to see as many of the others as
possible.  If anyone wants to do a lunch in interest of travel time home, let
me know, and everyone else on this email by replying to all.  I obviously
wont be able to check my email while I'm gone, and when I get back there will
be several hundred messages, so the preferred method is the phone.

To anyone else who reads this, as I will also copy it to the list, your
welcome to join us in Williamsburg next weekend on Sunday.  In fact I just
thought of an excellent, short, drive down the Colonial Parkway from
Williamsburg to Yorktown, and then Yorktown Pub food on the York River.  (one
of my favorite motorcycle rides around here)  Or whatever.  Any preferences,
let me know.
