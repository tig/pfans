Dear folks,

A few years ago a house in our neighborhood burned because an Olds in the=
ir attached garage cought on fire. They got out OK.

Now that we are going to be keeping 4 cars in a 2 car garage (Please see =
my post today re cocooning), and I keep buying them older and older, and =
our garage is attached, and I am installing electric lifts and (plastic?)=
 cocoons, and we sleep on the second floor with no fire escape, (though =
we have a throw-out-the-window-chain-ladder), we are extra concerned.

Any of you have experience/knowledge re automatic water-sprinklers, or =
automatic gas/foam-cannisters that would fill a space with inert gas or =
foam? Other suggestions?

Anyone know of a newsgroup or site re automatic fire extinguishing?

They built our house first, then attached the garage, so there is a layer=
 of brick veneer between the garage and the house, which is some comfort.

FYI:

Last fall when we were getting our house heat pump replaced, and the exte=
rior unit moved, the installer's helper was propane-torch-soldering a 2" =
copper tube joint a few inches from the new hole through the wall. He cou=
ght the insulation behind the brick on fire, it just smoked and smouldere=
d and glowed in a spot oh maybe two inches in diameter, never any flames.=
 So I used a fire extinguisher just like the one we keep in our garage =
and cars. It made an impressive cloud of fog and got yellow dust on every=
thing.

But as for putting out the fire, it sucked.

(I found a spray bottle like Windex comes in, filled it with water, and =
that put it out immediately. I suspect Windex itself would've worked just=
 as well.)

Will
