Hey Keith,

Removing the dash is not as hard as you might think but that might not
make your situation any easier.  Most of the wiring in the interior of
the car is concentrated around the instrument cluster, the center
console and fuse panel in the passenger side foot well.  You might want
to take out just the center console portion of your dash to do any
wiring repairs.  The center console for that year is easy to remove: 
	Simply remove the side carpet panels.  
	Remove the console trim.
	Unclip the retainer ring for the stick shift boot and let it hang about
the console.
	Undo the console's rear retainer bolts.  
	Remove the retainer bolt(s) from under the dash/instrument pod. 
	Carefully remove the warning lights/switches and the radio.
	Pull the console out.

Be *VERY* careful about the AC control and its attendant vacume hoses
and wires.  Remove the radio before removing this item.  There's enough
slack in these to pull the unit out a few inches and then tilt the unit
so it can be put back in behind the console.  Just leave that unit
hanging during your repairs.

Good Luck!

Subject: dash board removal

Hello,

This past June I aquired my first Porsche, a 928. First I'd like to
thank
Phil for putting it's picture on his web site (1980- Keith Robinson). I
suspect this car was a stolen / recovery or just maybe the most abused
Porsche on the planet. Although the body is in good shape, the interior
is
destroyed and it has numerous electrical problems. It appears that the
PO
had some sort of monster sound system that was not professionally
installed.
There's splices all over the place. Pigtail splices, Western Union
splices,
3 into 1 and so forth. I plan on attacking the electrical problems first
and, as you can see, I have my work cut out for me.

After waiting patiently for the workshop manuals to come off back order,
I
finally received them this Friday. I can not seem to find any procedures
for
removing the dash board. I believe removing the dash board would make
the
job a lot easier. Is there anybody out there that can tell me how to do
this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Keith
