There's another visual difference:the GTS has larger and more streamlined
outside rear view mirriors 

The '89 GT came with forged "club sport" wheels. These appeared on the 1988
928 Club Sport and the '88 944 Turbo S among others. The 1990 GT came with
 "Style 90" wheels which are very similiar in appearance to the club sport
wheels but are cast. These were standard on the GT's and optional on the
S4's. Of course, the 'wheels for the 90's cars incorporated the tire pressure
monitoring system sensors(2 per wheel).
If these haven't been answered before: 
1) the first year of the electronic dash was 1989. It was also the frist year
of the half 
height whip antenna on the roof.
2)the frist year of a limited slip became standard was 1990 according to
sales literature. Of course, that year was the elctronically controled
system. I have a copy of the window sticker from a 1989 GT. It does not
mention a limited slip in either the standard or option column. So, my guess
is that it wasn't standard on the 89 GT, but I could be wrong.

I have just completed a multi-year search for an S4 and have found out quite
a bit about the differences between the various years. If you have any more
questions, maybe I can help 
.
