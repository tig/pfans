When I bought my 928 it had a similar problem.  The tires were in 
horrible shape.  In fact, by the time I got the car up to Cincinnati 
one of them was showing cord.  Needless to say, among the other work 
I had done (steering rack, upper and lower ball joints, tie rods, 
bearings, etc.. major front end) I replaced the tires and had them 
balanced and aligned.  After the repairs but before the new tires the 
vibration was still noticable but not as bad.  Once I got the new 
tires on (Dunlop D40M2's) balanced and alligned the car drove 
perfectly and has ever since. 

Balance might be the culprit here.  It's cheap to get a balance job 
at a local tire shop.  That's what I'd try.
