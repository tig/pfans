These parts are cheap enough that I would replace them, Instead of an
engine if one of them decides to go.
There are actually 3 rollers, you also want him to check the rubber dome
on the end of the tensioner.  It only costs about $10 through 928
International and they have the tendency to dry out and become brittle.
When they crack or break like mine did you end up doing the timing belt
again because oil will shorten the timing belt life.  Not to mention
leak oil all over the place.  It will also add yet another place for
dirt and moisture to enter the heart of your beloved 928!  BTW the
tensioner almost never goes out but when it does its about $600.  Also
check the tensioner gasket.
