A workable solution to the problem is to install a starter relay
which will bypass the deteriorating wiring harness.    The original
harnesses accumulate corrosion throughout their complex 
length, and the usual area of problem is between the starter
switch and the solonoid, about twenty feet of wire and several
connectors.    

You interrupt the starter solonoid lead near the 14 pin connector 
near the front  of the engine, and use that to activate the relay.
On the other side of the relay you bring a new (large, very large)
wire off the hot terminal in the same area, and relay that down to
the starter solonoid.    I used number ten wire several times and
have always solved the problem, in conjunction with a large relay
(a diesel glow plug relay works perfectly).     The only difficulty
is finding a place to mount it.

This is not a particularly elegant fix, but the alternative is a difficult
rewiring job.    How many times do you have to ask a Corvette owner
for a push at a gas station before you fix it for good? (!)
