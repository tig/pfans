When I drove home tonight I heard an explosion-like sound from either between
or behind the front seats - just as if something had busted under very high
pressure.

The AC was off at the time - it had been sealed and recharged about 3 weeks
ago.

All systems appeared to work fine afterwards, as far as I could tell. I got
home alright, and did not see any fluid dripping under the car. To my
knowledge I had nothing in the car that could have busted.

Any ideas?
