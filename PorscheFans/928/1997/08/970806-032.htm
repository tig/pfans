Fixing the undercoating is fairly easy.  Most autosupply sells that
rubberised material that can be either
sprayd on or painted.  Just make sure that the steel is clean and rust
free first (I would even put some
primer on if the steel is exposed).  However, if you want to make sure
that the car is concour original,
you might want to find which brand of material is used on the car
originaly (Wurtz??).  This information
might be available from one of the listmember or even PCNA.

I will ask him about museum quality preservation next time I speak to him, and get back to you. However, I suspect that you have to watch out you don't keep a museum too dry for the patron's membranes. Not so with a cocoon.
