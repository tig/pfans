Hi all,
my '87 S4 is guards red, spent most of its life in Florida, and now lives
outside. Needless to say, the paint gets a bit oxidized and dull. Until 
recently, I had always washed/cleaned/polished/waxed it using Maguires 
products every 3 weeks or so (more washing between waxings of course) but
dull spots would still manifest after a bit over a week in the sun. I 
decided to experiment as follows: stripped all the wax off and cleaned up
any road tar etc. Next I covered all the painted surfaces with light 
mineral oil and let it soak like that for 3 to 4 hours. I washed the 
excess oil off and polished/waxed as usual. 2 months later, there is NO sign
of dulled/oxidized paint. Just an idea you may like to try if your 928 
is stuck outdoors in the sun..

As for a gripe, I have scrolled through WAY too much quoted text lately in
the daily digest. Yes it is a good idea to quote a bit to let newcomers
get a clue what a thread is about, but when one message has so much old
material included that taglines are repeated 3 times it is TOO much! 70-90k
per digest would be nice if there were more than 50% new material per post.
Enough griping...just a long day I guess :)

Enjoy the weekend in those fine German machines!

David Schultz
