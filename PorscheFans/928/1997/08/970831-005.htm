I just purchased a U.S. 1984 928S automatic and am looking for
information regarding upgrading performance/h.p.  The guy that I
purchased my car from also owned a 1979 Euro 928 automatic, and although
it was several years ago when I drove it, it seemed to have a lot more
acceleration than my 84.  I don't know much about the difference between
the two except the dual exhaust and about 66 h.p.

Are there any "typical" modifications that one can perform on a U.S.
1984 928S to bring it closer to its Euro cousin?  I know that the more
you are willing to spend, the faster you can go - but - are there any
specific mods that are performance/cost effective?
Dual exhaust?
High-performance chips?
Port and polish?
Blueprint and Balance?$$?

This is a brave new world to me.  A month ago, I would never have
thought I would be driving this car but here I am.  Thanks in advance
to all the 928 fans for the forum to discuss such topics.  The thought
of having a little chat with a dealer or speed-shop about such issues
makes me a little nervous (cha-ching $$$) At least if I have some idea
about what to consider before-hand, I will be a little better off and
won't be talked into something that won't really benefit the car.
