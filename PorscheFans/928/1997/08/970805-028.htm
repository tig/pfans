 928 Fans,
I just got off the phone with BettyJo Turner. If that name sounds kind of
familiar it is because she is and had been the Editor of Panorama for the last
25 years. BettyJo lives right here in Atlanta (Phil, now I know why I get
Panorama before anyone else).

We had some very interesting discussions about the 928. She actually got to go
to France for the debut of the 928 and drive one. She is also the instigator of
the recent 928 article by Kim Crumb and worked very closely with him to get all
the facts as accurate as possible. FYI : The photo of the S4 in that article was
taken by her husband Leonard at the debut of the S4 in Germany and hasn't been
used before because she felt the flowers distracted form the car.

She is now ready to join our ranks and is looking for a 90 (wants airbags)and up
low mileage auto S4. If anyone has any leads on such a 928 please e-mail me or
call BettyJo at Panorama (404) 378-9823. She is a huge fan of 928s and it would
be nice if we could help her find a nice S4 at a good price.
