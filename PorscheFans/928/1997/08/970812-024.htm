I haven't really been following the thread on this one but I seem to 
remember Tony mentioning one module he was after as being a "CDI". This 
is usually the acronym for capacitive discharge ignition which was 
certainly fitted on earlier 928's. I'm not sure until when. I know my 85 
with dual distributors doesn't have it. Out of curiosity, when was the 
dual distributor/ dual coil introduced? I thought it was with the 32V in 
85 but Marks message seems to prove that to be wrong. By the way, the two 
module are not splitters. They're more like amplifiers really but even 
that's not quite correct. They're basically just power transistors that 
are configured as switches for the coil primaries. The "switches" being 
turned on or off at the appropriate time by the computer. Electronic 
contact breakers!!! A CDI system works quite differently and does not 
have such modules.
