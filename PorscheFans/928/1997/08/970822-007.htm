Thanks for the tip!

Just got the porsche back yesterday. Mechanic says the pedal was failing
for some time. Makes sense. What I thought was clutch or transmission
problems, turned out that I was having to push the clutch hard to floor to
shift. Was having a hard time getting in & out of gear. Mental note: check
pedals first!

There ends my first month of owning the porsche. Looking forward to many
more!!! :)  

ps. Practical has NOTHING to do with it!
