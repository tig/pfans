     Kurt,
     Sorry about the typo. LR was labeled wrong in 3 places, but the rest 
     were correct. Scary brain lapse. I was also impressed how close my 
     actual numbers for adding a driver were to your calculated deltas for 
     adding a passenger. Looks like Porsche put the driver very close the 
     the F/R cg.
     
     I do not think that I will get back to the site where the scales were 
     to check the level of the surface anytime soon as it was on an active 
     airbase in Mountain Home, Idaho. I still may try your method using the 
     spare tire in my garage sometime, but maybe I'll save it for winter 
     when there is more car down time. I do have another question regarding 
     the spare. I knew of someone who had used his inflatable spare. After 
     using it he could not get it to compress back to the original diameter 
     and it would not then fit back into the spare tire well. Have you 
     experienced this?
     
     Looking in the workshop manual, it shows a range of spring forces for 
     a set compression value along with uncompressed spring lengths. If I 
     use a median value of force to estimate a spring rate it equals about 
     250lbs/inch spring rate (assuming linear rate springs). If this number 
     is correct, what RF perch height change would get me to balance? Also, 
     if I want to shift weight to the rear to help equalize F/R balance, 
     can I also increase ride heights at the LR and RR?
     
     Does anyone know the actual spring rates for my 91 GT? I know that I 
     also need to check the painted color stripes to know which tolerance 
     range I have. I haven't done that yet.

My guess is the FR in the 3rd line is really LR.

I'm really pleased with how close my numbers for adding a passenger are 
to yours - without even accounting for potentially different seating 
positions.
     
From the first set (w/o) driver, I get a 35 lb difference left to right 
for the front and -52 for the rear.  For the second, +86 Front and -19 
rear.  This would say the balance is off by 87 lb. for the first and 105 
for the second.  Therefore, I'd say very roughly the measurement gives 
96 lb. imbalance with an uncertainty of +/- 9 lbs. (although the 
uncertainty in the uncertainty is ..., well there is none).
     
Now, if you had the Kim Crumb springs, you would need to turn 1 adjustor 
by 0.34" effectively (about 2/3 of that depending on which).  Since you 
have the GT springs I'd suggest you measure your spring constant - 
probably you have to go 50% more is my guess (it's worth what you paid).
     
HOWEVER, we're talking 1/2" here.  I picked a good surface and it was 
out by 1/4" so you can't eyeball the surface (or I can't at least).  (Of 
course the surface won't change - next time you go back there you could 
measure the surface and then know where to go.)
     
I'd enjoy seeing how well you do using the spare tire method - then you 
can know your surface and see if the results are the same.
     
Best,
Kurt
