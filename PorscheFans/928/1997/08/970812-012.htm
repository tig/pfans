Hi folks,

I just want to clear up the impression a couple (or more?) people seem 
to have about the Euro I'm selling.  It's not in horrific shape.  You 
don't need to bring a trailer.  It's reliable.  The trans shifts fine.  
It is, and always has been, legally registered for the street.

Maybe we've all gotten used to sellers glossing over things and starting 
with "you're nuts" pricing.  I won't do that.  I don't like "surprises" 
after I buy a car so I put out the info at the start.  My car is simply 
16 years old and not had wash-and-vacuum-every-week sort of owners.  
Shop time for fixes and maintenance, yes (receipts available).  The 
asking price simply reflects my desire to sell it in a fairly short 
time.  If the price seems too low, I will gladly accept more.  (Phil, 
got some extra garage space? ;) )  This is not some rusting parts hulk 
I'm trying to dump.  Just ask Lucky, Marc & Evitza(sp?) at DEVEK.  It 
was the only Euro at the DEVEK meet on August 2nd so maybe a couple 
people will remember it.  Sorry for chewing up the bandwidth on this.

Doug K
