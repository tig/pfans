Some of you probably remember a few weeks back that I'd promised to do a
write-up about troubleshooting vacuum problems.  After scratching my
head for awhile, I decided to take the approach of generalizing the
process since each model's vacuum circuit is different.  What I'm about
to tell you is what I have experienced on my '83 928S.  This is probably
applicable from the year '78 thru '88.  If you accept this information
in context rather than in content, you'll probably be able to figure out
what the differences are between your year's model and my '83.

You need to have a reliable vacuum gauge to begin with.  Some gauges
(especially if you have an old one) tend to leak internally around the
piston seal.  This would give you a false indication that the vacuum
circuit that you're testing is leaky.  Test your gauge by plugging the
inlet and pull some vacuum.  The gauge should not show a leakage for an
extended period of time.  I make it a habit to tap on the gauge's face
with my fingers a few time to make sure that the needle "settle" and
would watch it closely for at least 30 seconds before I release vacuum.


I recommend that you remove the dash and center console if you suspect
many vacuum problems.  Obviously the vacuum source is from the engine.
The first component that I would check is the check valve located close
to the brake booster and master brake cylinder area.  Remove the check
valve.  Note its orientation and vacuum line hookup.  Test it
separately.  It should allow air passage in one way only.  Check the
four-way rubber coupler next.  On mine, I found that it leaks only when
I bend it slightly.  From the coupler, the vacuum lines runs all over.
It is color-coded so you should not have any trouble tracing it.  A main
line is the one that goes to the vacuum switch rack.  This rack is
behind the center console, underneath the behemoth ventilation unit.  If
you pull vacuum from this line and spot a leak, then you need to test
the vacuum switches (or relays) individually.  Each switch controls a
vacuum solenoid.  You can easily trace a vacuum line directly to a
solenoid.  But like I said before, accessibility is much easier when you
remove the dash and center console.  This is also a good opportunity to
lightly grease the pivot arm of the solenoids.  A solenoid should
operate smoothly and not in a jerky motion when activated or released.
If it does not operate smoothly and testing it does not show a leak,
replace it anyway.  A jerky operation is a sign that it is about to go.

Another vacuum line from the rubber distribution coupler goes to the
cruise control vacuum reservior.  This is located inside the fender,
driver-side.  You test the cruise control servo by applying vacuum to
the source inlet, which is the lower one.  As you apply vacuum, the
throttle assembly should move proportionately.  Keep it in a fixed
position and hold.  It should be stationary for a duration of time.  The
next step is to apply 12 volt to the electical connector sporadically.
Note polarity.  Whenever you apply voltage, you should hear a click and
vacuum will be released.  The throttle assembly should move in the
opposite direction.

On my '83, there are four vacuum solenoids in the center console area
and one next to the blower motor; between the interior and engine
compartment area, passenger-side.

You'll find that your car will start easier and possibly more power once
you've fixed any vacuum leaks.  This depends on where the problem
originated from.  For example, I find that my '83 doesn't stall anymore
whenever I turn on the AC.

I think this pretty much wraps it up.  Happy hunting!
