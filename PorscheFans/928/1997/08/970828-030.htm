I came back from Greece on Sunday and went to the shop where my 85 928 was
being repainted 993 Speed Yellow, and pretty much rebuilt from the ground
up. When I pulled up I was bombarded by a sparkling yellow wonder, it was
so bright and shiny I could barely look at it in the sun (ok, I'm
exaggerating a little). I have honestly never seen a more beautiful 928.
The S4 body work and paint was immaculate, the rims were beautiful, the new
GTS brakes were a glossy red, and the new two-tone yellow/black leather
interior was stunning.

Immediately the guys started with their apologetic ramble, "yeah you know,
it's a little rough around the edges, we're not done yet, you know, we still
gotta wet sand and then buff it, then compound it, then hand glaze it..."

I couldn't believe they were apologizing for the way the car looked,
absolutely beautiful. We took the car for a little cruise and stopped for
gas at a Mobil station. I went in to get a drink, and when I came out, a
group of 5-7 people were standing around the car in awe, and the rest with
their heads turned and staring from the gas pumps.

The painter got out of the car and nudged me, he opened the hood to reveal
a sparkling engine compartment, with yellow and black accents everywhere.
The airbox is yellow, along with the intake tubes and the crossbrace. All
the bolts are black with yellow washers. The onlookers erupted in wows and
hoots.
"Spent as much time painting in here as on the outside, sand, paint, clear."

Amazing! I think I'll drive around with the hood up wherever I go, or
needlessly check the oil very often.

Now just waiting for the new Koni reds to be put in with the Weltmeister
springs, and the installlation of the Devek headers. Pictures will be on
the way next week Phil!
