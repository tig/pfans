Not sure on an 86.  But on my '83 928S, the sensor is located directly
behind the transaxle body.  If you crawl from the rear/underneath and
look directly at the transaxle, you'll see a wire leading to the sensor.
There is a clip hold it in place.  I don't think the sensor is the
problem.  Make sure you don't have a broken wire.  How I fixed my
sporadic speedo was to removed the instrumentation cluster; check the
rivets close to the center of the flex circuit board.  If you can rotate
them with your fingers, its too loose.  Hammer it with a drift lightly
to tighten.  Do continuity check.  There are three electrical edge
connectors going to the instrumentation cluster.  Check that the wires
are not loose.  I had 3 wires making intermittent contact.  Clean the
fingers on the flex circuit with a pink eraser.  Finally, Remove the
speedo from the cluster.  You will see that a major component is an
40-pin IC.  You'll probably noticed that the IC pins are tarnished;
black in color.  On mine, they're silver-plated and the IC is socketed.
This is one source of intermittent contact; tarnished pins not making
good contact with the IC socket.  Pry the IC off the socket and brush
with a contact cleaner; local Radio Shack should have the cleaner.  Note
IC to socket orientation.  Reinsert; make sure no misaligned or bent
pins.  Voila!  Speedo should work like new.  Since you have the
instrumentation cluster out, check the bulbs too!  I've replaced all
mine, even majority of them is still good.  Reason being that the


filament of the good one is weakened due to time and use.  It WILL break
once you've reinstall the cluster and then find that some of them are
inoperative.  When installing bulbs, clean them with alcohol and do not
touch with finger.  This will extend the life of the bulbs.

Disclaimer:  Based on an '83 928S.
