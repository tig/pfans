Rob,

I didn't know that carnauba isn't a wax. Does carnauba contain blocker?

Generally, I know that everybody has their own preferences as to cleanser=
s, coatings, and leather and vinyl treatments. Anyone know of any reports=
, like maybe Consumer's Union, on same?

My operating impression is that UV damages all of the above, and is the =
(only?) part of sunshine that is harmful to any part of a car, therefore =
if I'm not dealing with the UV I'm not dealing with the real problem, but=
 I have no proof. Anyone?

Glad to learn that clear coats contain blocker. Is the clear itself immun=
e to UV?

Does anything for your car come with ratings, like say #40 blocker for =
your own skin?

Will
