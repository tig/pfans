Howdy all:

Glad you had a good time!  It was over before we knew it and wouldn't
you know it Lucky and crew immediately went to work again!  Lucky closed
up the bottom of the S4 used as a demo car, and Marc & Bob hooked up a
scope to NSTY to play with air meter settings.  Listening to the car it
sounded like an angry bull in a pen - WOOM, WOOM!   WOOM, WOOM!  Idle to
6500 rpm in less than half-a-second.  450+ hp (steer power?) busting out
of the seams!  Bring on those damn 300Z TT's now!  Headers and exhaust
sure turn the 928 into a race car... not to mention the stroker kit!

I must have started too late trying to collect signatures in my book - I
got 19 porschefans but recall someone saying we peaked at 51 cars!!!
The neat thing is folks were jotting down their car's nickname ie. Super
Wing, S-Look & Battlestar, so I'll start asking everyone to name their
cars, like all good race cars!  I missed getting Mark Anderson's
autograph but got a picture at least!  Hey Troy (six-liter 'Bionic GT'),
I laughed my a@@ off when I read your joke! "Two" funny!   I also like
the 928 characture by Angel (?).

Yes a Panorama reporter was there (undercover?) so we might make some
news.  BTW, I didn't go up to the roof for the parade photo - wanted to
stand by my car + hold up Phil Kalamaro's picture of 928 #00029 who was
with us in spirit) so whoever did I'd like a photo!  (that would be a
cool t-shirt too)  Susan will be sending a notice to everyone that
turned in a blue card, plus hopefully be offering photos for sale for
fans at large...

The bargain hunter of the day turned out to be ---  Alan Ng, again!  I
think he picked up Richard's spare wing & side skirts for much less than
just the spoiler when new!  There were some interesting items for sale
like Al Holbert S4 posters - a must have!  Gordon could you post contact
info for everyone?  And yes hold one for me!

I don't remember who got the People's Choice award since I was milling
around but for me it was a really tough choice between Del's absolutely
immaculate GT and Richard's Strosek...  Yes my tastes run the gamut on
this one but you know I dig any 928!.  Paul's '928 Flowmaster' looked
particularly stunning in it's new blue paint & technology wheels.  I
nearly flipped when I saw Sandy's black MicroCoat race car - super trick
carbon fiber taillight covers!!!  Wicked!

That was tremendous fun, and I think Lucky sure got a kick out of seeing
all these cars assemble that day.  I know I did!   There's lots of
activities left for the year and I'm glad to hear a couple new 928ers
joined the PCA saturday.

We are forgotten no longer - 928s Forever!   A huge THANK YOU to all the
volunteers, attendees, fly-in attendees, distinguished guests, and Devek
/ Dyno Tech for being our most gracious hosts & sponsors!!!  What a
great day!

Your fan,
Phil Tong

ps.
I will be pricing out '928 Owners Club' t-shirts in the coming week,
using the Paul Bell designed logo as displayed at the show.  The target
price might go to $16.95 + s/h for a black short sleeve t-shirt, with
brilliant white logo (small pocket print & large back print).  Of course
they will be printed on 100% heavy weight cotton tees like Beefy's or
similiar.  L and XL only, since min. print runs are in X dozens only.

pps.  21st Anniversary celebration planning volunteers wanted!  Since
we're 'coming of legal age' someonse suggested the wine country and I
sure second that idea!  More to follow...
