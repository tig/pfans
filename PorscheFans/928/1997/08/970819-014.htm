Hello!
Thanks for the comments!!

Of course. Always.

>About the center disk, its trashed too!  If you keep on using it, the
oval blued spots will >eventually fatique and crack.
Time for a "driver=mechanic" call.  I decided to re-use it, it was super
flat, the hot spots were not too deep, and buffed out nicely. I also
decided that the clutch job was not difficult enough to worry about the
risk of  -possible- complications arising from re-using this $$! part!
(If the clutch is still flaky, _THEN_ I'll tack it back out and buy the
center plate!) Thanks for the .02 though!!

I am sure many mechanic types know this trick, but here goes:  For
stubborn pilot bushings or bearings, simply find a dowel (wood or metal)
that fits the center hole really well.  Fill the end of the crank
completely with thick grease, keep pushing it in with the dowel until
there is no nore air in there.  Whack the dowel in, and the hydraulics
push the bearing/bushing out.  Add more grease, repeat.  Messy, but so
is a torch!! :)
