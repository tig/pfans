I have a couple of relatively minor problems I can't figure out and need
some ideas.

1) The front seat on the passenger side will no longer move.  This
applies to both the forward/reverse as well as back adjustments.  It was
working fine a short time ago.  I checked the fuse - it's ok.  I also
checked the switches on the seat.  They are all getting power.  Any
ideas?

2) The automatic release for the rear trunk no longer seems to work.  It
was working fine and just seemed to stop doing so. When you 'pull' the
switches, the motor works, but the lid does not open.  I tried adjusting
it up and down, still no luck.  I sprayed it with WD-40 to make it run a
little smoother.  Still no luck.  There must be some trick to its
deceptive simplicity.  Any ideas on this?

Thanks,

Jerry  '87 928S4/5-speed/grey leather and soooooooooo fast!
