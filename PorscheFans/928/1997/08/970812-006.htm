Vince Yu asked about glass removal - so here goes:

        Take off reveal trim and escutcheons.  Many use the 'piano wire'
method to cut the sealant.  The drawback is it's tough to do without an
accomplice, and it is easy to cause minor chipping of the glass around
the edges.  I usually use a putty knife to slide between glass and
opening just to 'cut' the sealer.....moving carefully around the
circumference of the glass.  At the same time, use the palm of your hand
to gently press outward on the glass - just enough to allow the sealer
to be sliced.  If you want, at this point, you can place small pieces of
plastic, paper, or anything else in the expanding gap to keep the
sealant from bonding back again.  I've found that after going around the
whole glass, you can generally get the glass to lift away from the
opening using evenly distributed pressure outward starting mainly at the
top of the glass.  It is important that once a part of the glass begins
to lift away, you move to another part so as not to allow too much
bending pressure which will result in breakeage.  You can use a blow
dryer around the edges to help soften the sealer.

I've removed about a dozen windshield/back glasses this way and only one
has broken - the 928!   YIKES!  On the other hand, complaining to people
that make their living doing this.......I was assured that at least one
third break on them as well - regardless of technique or tools.  I was
inserting the putty knife into the sealer without any outward pressure
at all on the windshield when........TINK.......it cracked!
*$%(@*#^&$!!!!

    Installation is easy and straightforward.  It takes considerable
time to clean all the sealant off the glass and the openening - but it
is time well spent.  It will assure a good bond and limit the chance of
a leak (either air or water).  I usually scrape the glass edges with a
razor blade, then use liberal amounts of lacquer thinner followed by
glass cleaners or anything else handy to get the glass as clean as
possible around the edges.  Putty knives, screwdrivers and such, can be
used on the opening to remove most of the sealant.  A non-residue
solvent (like acetone) should be used as a final cleaning fluid to prep
the edge of the glass to bond with the sealer.  Put the sealer ribbon in
place.....carefully drop the glass into the opening (you only get one
shot at positioning, or you'll have to take it back off to recheck the
sealant bead in the opening)......and PRESTO!

I've learned to do this myself as it's really not that difficult,
convenient, and saves considerable money.  Incidentally, the going rate
for a 928 windshield (new from auto glass place) is around $550.  I
found several used pieces for $150.  The only problem is that most
places will not ship the glass - so you'd need to find one within
driving distance.

Well.....that's it.   Hope this helps and may all your glass be
crackless!
