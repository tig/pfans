Paul,

You should've asked us first.  You VIOLATED no less than 2 fundemental
rules:

1.  This is the important one:  Never ask your significant other to
help.  Always find a way to do it alone.  You remain much better
adjusted this way.  Stephane has disputed this point with me so some may
be in a different boat than me but evidently you aren't.

2.  Always loosen the fill plug before opening the drain.  (You of
course have since figured this out but for the others out there.)

More seriously, with what oil did you replace the pea soup?  The
synthetics are reputed to really help the feel.  Typically you're
looking at $7/qt for locally available Mobil.  You can also get Swepco
or the widely touted Red-Line Racing mail-order (well, not this week)
for the same price.  I did the Red-Line and it did improve the feel a
lot.  Of course, we have different trannys so YMMV.  I did the squeeze
routine with heated oil  - made coupling and inserted it from the inside
of the red-line cap (which is a small non-standard cap).

Best,
Kurt
