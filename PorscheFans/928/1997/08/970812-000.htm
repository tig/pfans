* Hi All:  I purchased an 84 928S with 71K in June. I fixed most of the =
little problems it had but two of them have got me. Can anyone tell me =
any information about the following:

1. When I turn on the lights within 5 seconds I get a tail light warning =
light.  At first I had no tail lights on the right rear side.  I cleaned =
the fuse and holder and got the lights to work,  I have since replaced =
the fuse, but I still get the warning light.  Once and a while when I go =
over a bump the warning light goes out for a few seconds.

2.	I've been having a problem with operation of the cruise control. It =
will seem to engage, sometimes but drop outs during operation.  I can =
accelerate using the control but it will not hold the speed I set it to. =



Old 928's never die they just go faster
