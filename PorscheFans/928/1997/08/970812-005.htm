OK, why does it have to be taken in 2nd?

To paraphrase from the nearly useless Prost book on competitive driving
techniques, if you're going to run out of revs, change up to a higher
gear before the turn.  It's better to sacrifice some pickup in the turn
where you don't need much power than to sacrifice time, both in holding
back as well as shifting time, when entering a straight.  Further, these
V-8's don't have a narrow power-band so that I wouldn't think you'd lose
that much in the turn.  (Of course, the real answer is to change the
gearing.)

However, I don't know that track let alone that curve so please educate
me.
