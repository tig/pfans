Rick - Some inspectors are more touchy about front wheel bearing
play than others. When the bearing has just been adjusted, you
can feel essentially no play when you hold the tire and try
to move it back and forth, but a couple of mm of motion seems
pretty normal. The bearing is easy to adjust, but getting the
hub cover off is hard. There is actually a special tool for
pulling it off (the hub cover, that is), but I've only ever
seen it taken off with a hammer, some sort of punch, and some
patience and confidence that it will eventually come off if
you work your way around it, banging every 90 degrees or so.

Once the cap is off, you'll see the retaining nut, which is clamped
in place by an allen-head screw. Loosen the screw, then tighten the
nut until the washer under it "can just be moved with a screwdriver."
Pretty vague, but that's what they say. Then tighten the clamp
screw, put the cover back on, and you're done. Incidentally the
looseness might be a hint that it's time to repack the bearings.

And yes, I expect to be at NHIS on the 4th. Hope to see you there.
