Subject: More 928 questions/woes

Hi,

I'm still having the intermittent speedometer.  It is currently working but the
last two mornings I took the car into work it was not.  I've  tried the tap on
the instrument pod trick...

My previous 928, an '86 S / Auto, had a similar problem.  The dealer
diagnosed it as a dirty/faulty sensor on the drive shaft.  According to
them, there was a magnetic sensor that sensed rotation somewhere
under the car.  They did not want to replace it, since my speedo would
start as soon as speed got higher (25-30 mph) and getting to it would be
expensive.

Hope this helps.
