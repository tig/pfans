OK, I'll bite.

This conditions some of the answers.

This is something you can only observe under full-tilt racing conditions,
and can be fixed by baffles in the pan (sold, strangely enough, by Devek).
No street situation or likely PCA driver ed situation will ever expose you
to risk here, or with the other pre-GTS oiling problem, a starvation at
certain main bearings at sustained (10+ seconds) red-line (6500+ rpm)
engine speed. For those who are going racing, your crank can be drilled to
fix this problem.

I like hard cornering...

So do we all; corner hard and don't worry, dude.

For what year was the the trip computer added?

'89

>LSD became standard for '90, I believe?

on the GTs in '89 (still an option then on S4s).

>Was it available as an option earlier?

Yep. Look for option code 220 on the build sticker in the trunk.

>Did the changed single-disc clutch work right when it was introduced with
>the S4 in '87

Yep, as did everything else. There is no need, for clutch or any other
consideration, to get a later car to avoid early-model problems in the S4;
I've never heard of problems peculiar to '87 or '88 cars.

>Is it actually any better, esp. in high-hp applications?

No clear story here. The single disc clutch is very strong (700+ bhp), but
a healthy dual-disc clutch is, too, maybe stronger.

>Can you retrofit a double-disc unit to a later car?

Lucky Ekman says he can. By the way, I thought you wanted an automatic!

>Any (major) body changes after '87?  (If not, how can you tell S4/GT/GTS
>apart, without seeing a rear model designation?)

A real, original GT has wider wheels than an S4, with scallops rather than
slots around the rim (S4s got slightly different scalloped wheels in '90)
and a dual-outlet exhaust system (though variations abound).

GTS cars have mild barrel-shaped flares at the rear, covering five-spoke
"Cup" design 17" wheels (widely retrofit to earlier cars). A GTS also has a
red reflector strip between the rear lights and a body-color (rather than
matte black, as in S4s and GTs) rear wing.

By the way, most GTs do not have a model designation on the rear.

Not in the US, so far as I know. The improved aerodynamics of the '87+ cars
are part of a (big) package of changes which distinguish the S4 from the S,
but the late '86 cars have most of the engine power and all of the brakes
of the S4. They lack the wider rear wheels and tires, the snazzy-looking
wing, and some of the current price, so may be worth your considering (the
bank you rob can be smaller).

....and you'll need the 6 liter engine to turn the compressor in the hot
weather, right? More seriously, since cooling is a priority for you, look
for a car with rear air.
