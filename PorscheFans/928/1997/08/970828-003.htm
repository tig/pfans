A great summation Ed.

I think the 16v cars in general and any A/T or high-mileage ones are
taking a beating in the marketplace.  Your local paper or the for sale
msgs here, mine included,  prove that.  Well kept 32 valve manual cars
can hold their own because all it takes is one test drive to feel that
power.  If there's any doubt to our car's longevity, point 'em to the
dyno testing section in Project 928, then to all the nice cars in the
gallery - especially Vince Yu's close to 200k mile 928.  Then ask the
buyer if they've ever seen a 200k mile 'Vette or whatever that can still
move down the road like a 928 and look good doing so too.

I'd rather look at it this way, there's going to be alot of early bodied
projects shreding pavement in the future.  And Bob DeVore did get it
going with 16 valves...
