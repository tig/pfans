Hi,
        I'm still having the intermittent speedometer.  It is currently working
        but the last two mornings I took the car into work it was not.  I've
        tried the tap on the instrument pod trick - but I'm not sure if this
        fixed it or if it was the warming up of the car. (Speedo worked both
        times when I took the car home / air temp. warmed up to 85 from 70's).

        This weekend I took the car out for an extended drive and I noticed
        two other things.

        1. When I brought the car up to 90/95 mph or so, the drive went from
        normal/smooth to shuddering/bucking, I immediately slowed down.  
        Where should I start troubleshooting this one? Wheels not balanced
        correctly?  Engine mounts?  The only work I had done on the car 
        recently was to have a steering-rack, tie-rod replaced and a alignment.

        2. When braking hard from 60-70 mph -> 0 mph into a sharp left stop, 
        I experienced the shuddering/bucking again.

        Could this also be related to the tranny? When I got the car I had
        all the fluids changed including the diff, etc.  The car seems to
        drive normal under regular driving conditions, but the above two
        items have me very concerned.  According to the manual 3rd gear on
        the auto should be good up to 90 mph (when the two problems occurred
        above, the car was in D), could this problem be indicative of the 
        tranny having problems up/down shifting?  The car seems to shift
        fine during normal driving.  I neglected to see where the RPM's 
        were when this occurred, I'll try and recreate the two situations
        today.  Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks,
-Mike
