Never seen it. But did you know that a VW and Porsche dealer actually built a
widened VW Golf based on a complete 928 chassis, engine and interior? That
was a real stealth speeding car...

 something like .42 Cd...

Indeed the 928 aerodynamics were not that efficient initially. Keep in mind
that the design was developped in the EARLY 1970ies - years before the car
went into production and at a time when everybody else built "boxy" cars. The
round rear seems to cause a lot of turbulences in the air, reducing
efficiency. Also, the wide tires and intensive cooling requirements probably
limited aerodynamics. However, Posche (and also Mercedes) did a lot of wind
tunnel testing for keeping dirt off the windows etc - and we keep hearing the
positive results from other list members.

Leonard asked why the car had no downforce when tested backwards. Well, first
I'm not an aerodynamics expert, and second I have just heard this as a rumor
and don't know any specifics. 

However, cars with low rears generally seem to have a tendency for uplift -
that's why so many of today's performance cars have a wedge-like shape or
rear spoilers. 

This reminds me of a guy in Germany who reversed the body on his Beetle on
the chassis. Wherever he drove people were scared to death, and he even made
it on TV...

Well, don't try that with your 928 - you'll seriously compromise high speed
stability (see above)... ;-)
