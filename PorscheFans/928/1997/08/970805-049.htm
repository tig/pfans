Nothing strange about this. The GTS has wider tires, and doesn't have the
adjustable air inlet louvres the S4 had. The tires alone could easily account
for the difference to the S4 (Unfortunately wide tires cost money,
efficiency, max speed - but they're FUN!)

>> Something else strange is that "Project 928" says they got a Cd of
0.390 with the original 928 shape, although it does say that the 
test was run with a 1:5 model. This was compared with the first 
911, which had a Cd of 0.381. The problem with the 928 was seen
to be its rather substantial width.

Usually these 1:5 models yield much lower drag coefficients than the real
life production car. I believe the main reason are the difficult simulation
of cooling air flow in the models, as well as the differences in trim and in
the grooves between the panels. 

BTW: Has anybody ever noticed that the sheetmetal of the front and rear doors
on newer Mercedes cars are overlapping? Guess what: It has been done for
aerodynamic reasons! I wonder, if Lexus has copied that already...
