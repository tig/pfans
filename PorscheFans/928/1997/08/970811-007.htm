Some time ago I posted a question about a couple of extra wires with 
connectors coming out of the injection computer connector. There are also 
a couple of similar wires on the Ignition computer. I finally found out 
what they do for those of you that are interested. Connecting them 
together changes the ignition and injection maps for lower octane fuel. 
As an aside, I found this info on a print from the All Data database that 
someone had mentioned before. Via a couple of different contacts I had 
managed to get prints from both the All Data and Mitchell databases for 
the engine controls of my 85. The Mitchell was hopelessly wrong in many 
respects but the All Data seems to be pretty good. Of course, the 
Mitchell could be better than All Data for different vehicles but I guess 
we don't care about that do we. These databases are huge with all kinds 
of info on all kinds of cars. The major stumbling block is the price at 
several thousands of dollars which really does limit it to professionals 
I would say.
