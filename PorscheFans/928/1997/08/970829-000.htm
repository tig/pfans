Actually Vince's answer wasn't quite right even for the earlier
(L-Jetronic) cars. The cold start injector is powered from the
starter circuit, so it operates ONLY when the car is being started.
The timer switch lets it operate for only a few seconds, so that
if the car doesn't start, it also doesn't get flooded. The fast
idle is caused by the auxiliary air regulator, which sits on top
of the engine, just ahead of the air cleaner, slightly to the
right of center. When open, it bypasses some air around the
throttle, giving the same effect as pressing a bit on the gas
pedal. It has a heating element, powered from the fuel pump
relay, which causes it to close over the period of a few minutes.
Enrichment is provided by the normal injector controls responding
to the temp sensor.

Now, I don't happen to have an '85 convenient to hand to look at,
but is it possible that it too has an auxiliary air regulator?
