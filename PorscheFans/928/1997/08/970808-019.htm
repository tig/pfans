<<Hi Brian,



If the '85 LHD 928S down here in NZ falls through, I'm seriously

considering getting a car in the USA later this year and shipping it over

here. That one was (so far) top of my list of potentials, as I'm looking

for a bargain basement price. The body condition is not important to me and

the entire interior would be removed (with anything suitable - radio,

alarm, etc - being transfered to my '83 road car).>>

Have you talked to the seller yet?  



<<Considering the front end re-build, is the chassis suitable for racing, or

would there be major work involved?>>

I really don't know what you might be concerned about as far as racing it
goes.  I was only concerned with a) driving it, and b) getting rid of it.
 The major re-work doesn't bother me per se, it is only the fact that the
work appeared sloppy and amatuerish.  I wouldn't be able to know more without
a better inspection, and possibly even a partial tear down.  With the poor
quality work (e.g. the hood didn't fit properly so the lip of the hood near
the windshield was riding about 1/4 to 1/2 inch too high.  A BIG gap.  And
the front of the hood was snug against the bumper fascia.  Obviously the
fenders were rebuilt too short.) you will naturally expect more corners to be
cut than can be seen just by a cursory inspection. 



<<I'm hoping to find a suitable vehicle in the Mid-West or West of USA and

driving it to SanFran for shipping. A good way of seeing part of your

country (as long as the car holds out for the trip).>>

It seems if you were looking at an '85 already you could find one for prettey
near $10 K to $13 K any day of the week.  Why buy for $9K and have headaches?
 Plus you would be concerned about the engine if you were going to race it.
 It seemed alright, good power, no hesitation or rough idling.  But it also
leaked pretty badly.  

Good luck,

Brian Robinson
