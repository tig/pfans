Hi,

I believe I may have grabbed the best deal on an S-4 I've heard of yet.  
It's an 87, Guards red over black, 122,000 miles, 5-speed, Porsche 
maintenance since new (up to date and all records), toolkit, compressor, 
new Dunlops, never wrecked, garaged, never smoked in, no aftermarket 
parts or mods except Alpine CD, creampuff.  On the down side, it has a 
torn CV boot, cruise or power hatch release doesn't work, dash pod is 
cracked, nose is faded, only has one key, and the passenger tailight is 
cracked.  

I saw the car advertised in the Augusta Chronicle for $12000, and 
figured it was trashed, but went to see it anyway.  When I saw it, I had 
to have it, and paid the asking price after getting it a full checkup.  
Do any of you know of a well-maintained S-4 going for less?  Is the 
resale value on these cars really that low?

The paint is unbelievably good for a car with this many miles, probably 
since it's a southern car.  Is this typical of Porsches?  The interior 
also looks younger than it is.  

This is my first Porsche, but it probably won't be my last.  I've had 
(and still have) some interesting cars, but nothing compares to the S-4.  
I look forward to fixing the minor problems with this car, and 
appreciate in advance the help I will get from list members.  I would 
also love to meet other 928 owners in the Augusta, GA,/ Aiken, SC 
region.   Thanks for having a great list,

LeeH
