Hi Scott' I have the same car and have had the same two problems.  The
light warning was a bad connection in the drivers side front parking light.
The cruise control was fixed with new vacuum hoses.

>1. When I turn on the lights within 5 seconds I get a tail light warning =
>light.  At first I had no tail lights on the right rear side.  I cleaned =
>the fuse and holder and got the lights to work,  I have since replaced =
>the fuse, but I still get the warning light.  Once and a while when I go =
>over a bump the warning light goes out for a few seconds.
>
>2.	I've been having a problem with operation of the cruise control. It =
>will seem to engage, sometimes but drop outs during operation.  I can =
