	ok, here's one for you: last week i traded cars with
	a co-worker: i got his '86 carrera (lowered, chipped, etc)
	for the week, and he kept my 928 in his locked garage while
	he went on vacation. tuesday he returns, driving my 928.
	he casually mentions to me that the PS belt bailed out on his
	way to work. i wander down to the parking garage with a
	flashlight, open the hood, and point it at the PS pump, and have
	a look. he says "oh, that's the PS pump? what's this thing here,
	its the one that's not spinning."  "oh that's just the smog
pump,
	which drives the fan", says I. hmm, i think, that's funny. a bit
more
	looking, and i discover that what actually happenned is that the
	front bolt backed out of the crank, and the pulley cluster is
now
	dangling helplessly in front of the harmonic balancer. there's
	a '928 specific 'OH SHIT'" for you :-) :-)

	sorry i couldn't resist. i tightened it up, real good this time,
and
	drove it home. runs great! less money!


928s forever!
