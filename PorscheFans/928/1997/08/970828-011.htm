Hi everyone,

 I own an '84S that the clutch pedal is not returning to the top =
sometimes.  This condition seems to start, in stop and go traffic when =
the car gets hot(near the second white line, runs near the first line =
most of the time).  When the clutch is let out at stop lights it grips =
at half of travel.  I can bring it back up from half way to top with my =
foot on the side of the pedal or it pops up on its own good time.  The =
problem is not consistent and can go away for weeks, as well as it seems =
to cure it self so far.  I also am having a hard time getting it out of =
gear (second or third ) if driven in those gears for any length of time. =
Does not happen when going thru the gears on my way to fourth and fifth. =
Also when accelerating hard and letting off  in (first second or third ) =
I feel the shifter moving from the torque of the motor is this normal.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Old 928's never die we just make them go faster
