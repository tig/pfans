 When you mean that it does not turn over, you still mean that the
starter is turning the
engine?

Also, is it the same gas as it was left 2.5 years ago?  You might want
to make
sure that the fuel stills get to the engine (fuel pump running and fuel
filter not clogged).

I will bounce this question to the 928 Porschefans list and ask the 500+
member to give
you a hand with your problem.  I strongly suggest that you join the list
at
http://www.porschefans.com

keep me posted, I can suggest many ideas with a bit more details (ie how
did the
car run when it was parked?)

Good luck,

.
