The little pin hole has an important role in our car.  It should be set
at the
12 o'clock position when installing the thermostat in the car.  It is
put there
to let any trapped air escape from the system.  If your thermostat is
not brand
name, you should use a small drill bit and put a small hole to serve the
same 
purpose.

What I find surprising is that Porsche engineer thought of putting a
bleeder
on the 944 but removed the need for a bleeder on our car with a simple
hole
in the thermostat.   Very interesting...
