Hello everyone,
   not a good day today. I was driving my just washed 928 GT today when =
this
lady ran a stop sign and hit me hard in the front passenger side by the
wheel.  Heavy damage to the bumper quarter panel, headlight... it looks =
like
the engine compartment got damaged from the impact also. Not to mention =
heavy
frame damage, the drivers side door rubs with the front quarter panel =
and I
was hit on the passenger side! I'm not sure of the damage bills yet but =
will
find out Monday. She was at fault so her insu. carrier better cover all =
of
this.  One other thing is my 2 week old rim was badly damaged also. I =
was
physically ok from the accident though.

Hi Matt:  Sorry to hear about the wrecking of your 928.  Mine  1981 was =
wrecked on the LF and it sounds like you have all the same parts wrecked =
as I did on the other side.  Mine was totaled as the Porsche dealer in =
Reno came up with a 17,000. Repair bid.  I decided to do the job myself =
and it was easy once I got past the frame rail, I had a local body shop =
with one of the best frame machines available do the frame and alignment =
and I am doing the rest.  Finances keep me from blasting through the =
repairs, but quite frankly, that saved me many dollars.  I picked up a =
fender  for 500. And a bumper cover for 250.  The headlight was 100. I =
straightened most of the other parts and am still in the process before =
I have it painted.  I had to take it back to the frame shop 3 times =
until I was satisfied with the alignment of the frame rail, what I did =
to check the alignment at home was, on a level garage floor I placed =
two. 1.5X1.5 aluminum angles that were 20' long alongside each tire.  =
Then I measured in-between them and made a centerline on the floor with =
a carpenters chalk line.  From there it was just a job of a plumb bob =
and checking that everything was symmetrical.  mine was twisted. If you =
have patience and time, it is the way to go, I am back in mine and still =
under 3500.  For a 1981.
Good luck
