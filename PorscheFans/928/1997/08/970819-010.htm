Leonard/Nelson,

My '89 S4's (5-spd/55k miles) temp gauge consistently reads between the
second and third white marks, slightly favoring the third line.  I added
Water Wetter and it seemed to reduce the temp a needle width.  At the
track, the temp reads as high as on the third white line, never above it. 
Some people have recommended 25%/75% anti-freeze/water mixtures for added
reduction of coolant temps.  I have not experimented with this change
though.
