In the end, I could do it in 1 hour - probably take you 3 the first
time.  If a shop charges $100-$200, maybe it's worth your time, maybe
not.  The measurements are certainly very prone to errors but the
calculations shouldn't be - I've reduced them to subtraction and
division in the write up.

My guess is the FR in the 3rd line is really LR.

I'm really pleased with how close my numbers for adding a passenger are
to yours - without even accounting for potentially different seating
positions.

From the first set (w/o) driver, I get a 35 lb difference left to right
for the front and -52 for the rear.  For the second, +86 Front and -19
rear.  This would say the balance is off by 87 lb. for the first and 105
for the second.  Therefore, I'd say very roughly the measurement gives
96 lb. imbalance with an uncertainty of +/- 9 lbs. (although the
uncertainty in the uncertainty is ..., well there is none).

Now, if you had the Kim Crumb springs, you would need to turn 1 adjustor
by 0.34" effectively (about 2/3 of that depending on which).  Since you
have the GT springs I'd suggest you measure your spring constant -
probably you have to go 50% more is my guess (it's worth what you paid).

HOWEVER, we're talking 1/2" here.  I picked a good surface and it was
out by 1/4" so you can't eyeball the surface (or I can't at least).  (Of
course the surface won't change - next time you go back there you could
measure the surface and then know where to go.)

I'd enjoy seeing how well you do using the spare tire method - then you
can know your surface and see if the results are the same.

Best,
Kurt
