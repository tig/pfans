Dave Forlani has a recent 928 acquisition and a cruise control question.

I've also been having a problem with intermittant operation of the cruise
control.  Sometimes it will engage, sometimes it won't.  If it will engage,
it will work perfectly (no drop outs during operation).

I have had a series of vacuum problems.  Just replaced the brake vacuum
booster and I'm waiting on parts (from Germany, no less) to replace the 5
electrically operated vacuum switches that cause the a/c-heater flaps to
open and close.  Three of the switches leaked badly when voltage was
applied.  

So...  I don't know if my problem will be solved when the vacuum switches
are installed but I doubt it as I've disconnected that particular vacuum
line (by the way, the car feels like it has more power now... could the
vacuum advance have been affected by the leak?).

I have noticed that the cruise control is much more likely to kick in if
(1) the car has been sitting in the hot sun for 3 or 4 hours or (2) I run
the engine up to 4K or 5K RPM for a short run when entering the freeway.

I have the service manual and all the tests passed, so I wonder if the
cruise control brain is faulty?
