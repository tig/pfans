As a strictly "for reference" quick thumbnail check, we used to jack the
front end up, grab the tire at the top and bottom, and shake gently.  You
should be able to feel the wheel and tire just barely move on the spindle,
almost imperceptably.  Grabbing at the top and bottom isolates the bearings,
removing steering component play from the check.

I haven't tried this on a 928 yet, and would CERTAINLY recommend qualified
technicians check the adjustments.  Anyone got the specs for this?

By the way, I think I've solved my electrical problems.  Many "Thanks!" to
all those who assisted.  The solution was to replace my 20-year old
multimeter.  I fried it checking the "key off" drain from the battery.
 Replaced it with a new-fangled digital autoranging multimeter that still
can't seem to handle the amperage when the key is off.  Won't read on the 20A
scale, fries on the 32-320mA scale.  Oh, well.  Actually, the "pull the key
out" suggestion hit home hard for me.  I read that and said "D'OH!"  Anyhow,
I'm pulling the key, maintaining the battery, and not worrying so much.
 Things are working better.  The car now shows resting voltage of 12.92VDC at
rest, comparing to 11.5 or so on the car's voltmeter.

Subject: Some play in front bearings

While getting tech'd tonight for a driver's ed event this Monday at New
Hampshire Int'l Speedway, the inspector noticed some play in the front
wheel bearings.  There was the same amount on each wheel.  Does anyone know
how much, if any, is acceptable? (and how easy is it to adjust?)  Any
comments appreciated.  Are there any other readers going to the event on
Aug 4th?  We're usually lone rangers.

Thanks,
