This problem is often caused by the failure of the pressurized side
of the fuel system (the fuel rails) to retain pressure with the
fuel pump not running. There's a check valve - possibly integral with
the pump - that should prevent fuel from flowing backwards through
the pump. If the valve leaks, you end up with a "vapor locked"
condition until the engine cools down. Test for it with a pressure
gauge on the fuel system.
