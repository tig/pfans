---------------Separator------------------

I've discovered two things that are left on other then just the "P" light.
There is power left to a couple of relays (or one that does a couple of
things).  The first is the "key in ignition" warning binger.  Second is the
headlight motor.  They will still pop up or retract when the key is off &
then back to acc. but not if in acc. after key removal!
