No.  Been there, done that.

1. You can get access to the switches, radio, clock and console
accessories by removing the left and right knee shelves, then slide out
the carpetted console side covers. They are positioned by a single screw
each in the footwell and possibly one at the far end near the seats.  As
you can tell from your new switches, they actually connect way up front
past the forward part of the console in the near the inside edge of the
footwell.

2. The old switches can be pryed up from the top of the console with the
every useful putty knife - they just snap in from the top.  Removing
them will probably break one or more of the switches, so I wouldn't do
this unless I was replacing the switch with a new one.

3. To remove a switch for repair, you could loosen the front of the
console by removing the two bolts at left and right front edge (goes
through easily broken plastic tabs - repair with Plastic Weld) next to
the seat bolsters.  Then you can push up the switches from the bottom.

All this is much easier to do with the front seats out.

Do 1. and 3. above.  Also, the console frame is held at the top by a
bolt/screw behind the A/C vent which is removed with the putty (again)
knife.  Left and right fasteners hold the console frame at the top.  The
right side is accessed by removing the glove box door and liner.  The
left is under some plastic shielding under the instrument pod/cluster.

With drivers' seat out, lying on floor with head under dash, you will be
able to see the screws.

Be aware that, to completely remove the console, you will likely need to
disconnect the radio, clock, cigar lighter, A/C control head, a couple
of vacuum lines to A/C vent flapper valve, and interior temp sensor. 
BUT, you don't really need to remove the console for access to switches
or most accessories UNLESS you are overhauling the vacuum systems, have
serious or wierd A/C problems or are replacing the dash.

All are the same.
