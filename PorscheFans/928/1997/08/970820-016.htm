Hi All,

I am fairly new to this sight and so far I enjoy all the great info!

I am finally in the market for my first Porshe, and without a doubt it
has to be a 928 S-4 or GT (only as a second pleasure car for nice
days).  I want to set a limit of $25K (but would like to stay a bit
lower)and have found some good prospects in the last 6 months.  I will
not be ready to buy until late next month and I have been getting a
scare from some potential sellers.  

The problem/question is whether or not the 28s have started to climb in
price.  I have heard this for a little while but I am not sure if it is
really happening yet or if these might be pressure techniques on the
part of the sellers.  

Are the prices stable (or at least for a few monthsto come)?

What is the newest 5-speed/lowest miles I should expect to see in my
price range?  

I live in Cincinnati and am wondering if waiting until December will
cause a sports car's price to drop signifigantly knowing how much people
love to take them out in the snow (nation wide prices that is).

Thought I would go the people I know have the true 928 knowledge.  Any
help would be a great service.

Joe.
