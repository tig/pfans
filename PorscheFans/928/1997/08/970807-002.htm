Hi Brian,

If the '85 LHD 928S down here in NZ falls through, I'm seriously
considering getting a car in the USA later this year and shipping it over
here. That one was (so far) top of my list of potentials, as I'm looking
for a bargain basement price. The body condition is not important to me and
the entire interior would be removed (with anything suitable - radio,
alarm, etc - being transfered to my '83 road car).

Considering the front end re-build, is the chassis suitable for racing, or
would there be major work involved?

I'm hoping to find a suitable vehicle in the Mid-West or West of USA and
driving it to SanFran for shipping. A good way of seeing part of your
country (as long as the car holds out for the trip).
