Earlier this spring I washed the engine compartment of my '84 and it didn't 
run well for over two weeks. About the time I'd think it was drying out, it 
would resume sputtering, hard starts, and missing. Of course, I thought 
maybe I had disconnected something with the water pressure although I was 
very careful and couldn't find any loose wires, etc. Took the car to my 
mechanic. According to him, when the water sitting on the manifold heats up 
and begins to steam, it will find any imperfection in the plug wires. The 
solution, buy new plug wires ($150 - $400) or be patient. Patience won. Like 
yours, though, I've never had any problems in the rain. Go figure.

Hi all;

Just have a quick question.  The ignition switch seems to be going out
on my '79 928.  When I turn the key to start the car, the motor doesn't
always turn over.  I have to switch it off and try again (sometimes more
than once).  The warning lights always come on when I turn it to the
first postion, so it is only when I turn it to the "start" position that
it is not working.  Anybody have any suggestions?  The key turns easily
enough, its just not making contact when I try to start the car.

Thought I'd share what looks like a good buy with you all.  Tweeks is
running an ad in October's Excellence offering Borla stainless steel
exhaust for 78-84 928 @ $276, 85-86 @ $363, the rest of you @ $876.
Seemed like a good price to me.  I should be getting mine as soon as UPS
gets back on track.

Thanks,
