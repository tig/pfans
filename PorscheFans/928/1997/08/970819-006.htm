Hi guys.

Leonard,=20
You say maybe the water pump is getting weak! but how do you check it short
of taking the timing belt off and rotating it by hand. I asked this one
before but got no useful reply "Stephane"!!
My S4 runs between the middle and the top white mark at the moment, I've
just put a different engine in and the old one ran right in the middle all
the time but the weather was not so warm then so I cant really say if its
normal or not. I have noticed that the electric fan runs quite a lot latley,
I Measured the coolant temp and it is fine 75-85=B0C, my dealer says it can
run as high as 100=B0C in hot weather.
My main problem at the moment is I cant get cool air, I've checked the
setting as per John whites good procedure and its ok, I did get lower
readings 2.4k to 3.9k for the sensor chain but I put that down to high
ambient temp, any comments John?? I did notice that the motor doesnt do
anything at 27 on the slide but only at 30 can be the same problem.
I clamped the coolant feed to the heater core to check the heater valve but
the air was still the same temp so I dont know, maybe I have a problem with
the intake flap, job for tommorrow!

If I get it all sorted out I'm going to drive the Nurburg ring next week
then we'll see how hot it can get!!
