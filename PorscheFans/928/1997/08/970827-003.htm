Following an internal break in my radiator, I *had to* replace my 3-speed
automatic.

Since I had owned an '85 and '86, I preferred the 4-speed transmission, and
I figured the difference in price would be worth it. It was. But the swap
was pricey.

Here's what you need: a good '85 or '86 4-speed automatic ('83-4 are said
to be problematical, '87 will not fit because of the larger bellhousing). A
late torque tube (might as well buy the rebuilt one). A late wiring
harness*. The later shifter and bezel. Linkage pieces. Miscellaneous
goodie$.

....and a good mechanic.

R&R on a 928 transmission is 10 hours.

A couple of warnings: Even though you see rebuilt torque tubes advertised
for $550, be aware your old torque tube has just about zero trade-in value,
so think $850 outright

*--yes, the trans. has a small wiring harness that costs $525 from Porsche.
I found a used one, from the folks who sold me the transmission, for $75,
and had my mechanic spice it into the car in a few hours.

All in all, I think the swap cost me just under $4000.

Recently, while shopping for a race car., I looked at a Euro '85 928S. It
had an automatic, but the shop assured me that swapping over to a 5-speed
was affordable. He said he was sure 928 International would swap the (low
mileage, perfect) 4-speed automatic for a 5-speed, straight across, then
you'd have to buy the clutch, pedals, shifter, linkage, etc. and install
it. Sounded like about $2200 or so. But since you do not have a low mileage
4-speed, I don't know what you'd pay for a transmission outright. I suspect
the 5-speed conversion would cost about the same, since you don't have to
replace the torque tube... Personally, I'd plan to put syncros at least in
the 5-speed...

In many cases, with 928s, you're better off just buying a whole car cheap,
taking what you want and parting it out.
