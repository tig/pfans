Or maybe just Marvy, as they said in the fiftys.  At least according to Happy
Days.

Brian , 

How does the person driving the car at 115 see where their going when you've

got the hood up looking for oil leaks?????>>

Generally I look for the leaks with the car parked, and the engine off.
 Usually when I am checking my oil level during my fill-ups at the gas
station.  I only notice a collection of oil after driving fast for more than
a few seconds.  

If I want to check for leaks at speed, I have the passenger climb out the
sunroof (carefully!!) and slowly inch around the hood to the front bumper
fascia.   I have installed a step device on the license plate frame.  You can
flip this down and use it to support yourself.  Then I pop the hood, and
whoever is out there will lift it only a few inches (so as not to catch too
much wind), and peak under.  It's really pretty easy.  Try it, you will be
amazed at how it goes.
