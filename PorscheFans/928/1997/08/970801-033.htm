OOPS!  I misspoke myself.  I meant to say that it is most audible at
2-3k rpms in 1st and 2nd gear.. It still squeaks in all 5 gears, or in
neutral.  Pop the hood, idle-nothing, rev up to 1500 and hold for a few
seconds- squeaks and rattles to end all!, rev to 4000 and higher,
squeaks go away.......
The best thought so far is that the T/O is touching part of the pressure
plate when it should not, and therefore has cooked all its lube out, and
squeaks until you step on the clutch, squishing it tighter against the
pressure plate, and shutting it up.  This is probably right, because at
the worst rpm (2K), with full squeaks happening, one quick stab of the
clutch, (not even enough to disengage) will quell the racket for 2-3
seconds.  My thoughts are this is the amount of time for the T/O to get
spun up and noisy again..
I might drag my 'puter out into the garage and make a .wav file of this
"feature"!!
What are your thoughts on letting the clutch just continue to do this
until it dies and replacing the whole thing.  Or would it be better to
just do the T/O.. (NO cancel that, If I'm going in that far, I'm
replacing everything!)  The clutch is GREAT in grab, but the chatter is
still there, I wonder if the ___head P.O. cheaped out and just put in
just friction plates or something... ( He did go into the trans to cure
a worn out synchro, and could not afford a set, so he just swapped 'em
around{or something} "So now it just grinds going into 2nd, which is
better'n it happening coming down from 3rd") (yes that is a
quote..grrrrrr...)

OK bye!! (sorryforambling)

Thanks!!
