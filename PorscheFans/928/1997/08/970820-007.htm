     Kurt,
     
     I read your Corner Balancing page and it took me back to my college 
     days and engineering classes. Great mathematical analysis! Your 
     backyard measurement method looks like a viable application of 
     principles, but also appears to require diligence and patience to 
     prevent serious errors in measurements and calculations. I applaud 
     you for efforts.
     
     I participated in a SCCA sanctioned Divisional auto-x a few weeks ago 
     and they had scales set-up to weigh the modified and prepared cars for 
     rules verifications. I put my 91-GT on their 4 corner scales for a 
     quick check. They were set-up on a good concrete surface so I assumed 
     it was reasonably level although it wasn't verified as such. I weighed 
     the car with and without driver, the car as I race it - no spare tire 
     or tools, gas tank near empty, and front spring perches lowered fully.
     
     Car Only = 3457 lbs                     Car + 164 lb driver = 3621 lbs
     
     LF = 953  RF = 918                         LF = 1014  RF = 928
                       F = 1871                                    F = 1942
     FR = 767  RR = 819                         FR = 830   RR = 849
                       R = 1586                                    R = 1679
     F/R = 54.1/45.9                            F/R = 53.6/46.4 
     R/L = 49.8/50.2                            R/L = 50.9/49.1
     
     Change by adding driver:
     dLF = 61   dRF = 10
                        dF = 71
     dRF = 63   dRR = 30
                        dR = 93
     
     This was very interesting and helpful (and free) data. I now want to 
     adjust spring perch heights to improve balance with the car + driver 
     numbers. My idea is to raise the right front corner which will add 
     weight to the RF and LR while subtracting weight from the LF and RR. 
     My question is how much??? My car has stock GT springs. By making 
     assumptions and calculations do you think that we could calculate a 
     height change that would get me close? My SWAG is 0.20-0.25 inches. I 
     guess I should play with your equations and see what I come up with. 
     Can you help me?
