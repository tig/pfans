I got new window switches for my 83 928 and would like to install them.
The pattern of my old window switches is gone and would like to restore them.
In addition, the new  switches have a different mechanism with a very nice
mechanical felling.
 I got these in Stuttgart at a very good price.

I guess that to install the new switches I must remove the central
console to get access to the connector attached to the switch.
Is this correct? Can anyone give some suggestions on how to remove
the center console if required?
Is the connector at the end of the newer switches the same
as in the 83 model?  My new switches have a red connector at
the end of the cable with 4 terminations (I think).

Thank you.
