Howdy Y'all,
Just wanted to announce that I'm back. Still have my '83 928S. When 
Porschephiles went down I never bothered to join this list. Work was kinda 
crazy then (still is) and I did not have the time to read everything.

I've been on for about 2 days now. Sounds like a good group. And a little 
more conversation going on than in the Porschephiles list. Probably because
you don't have to weed though all the broken 944 timing belt stuff and 914
FI problems... :*)

I've probably spent too much money on the car because of not having the list
wisdom. But I'm planning on doing some suspension upgrades for track use and 
will need y'all's (Texan for you guy's) insight. This knowledge has been 
invaluable to to me. Especially when something goes wrong and I get 10 responses
on how to fix the problem. I also miss helping people on the things I can fix.

The other thing I missed was trying to get together with other PorscheFans
at the last two Parades.

Thanks,
Brian Scudder
