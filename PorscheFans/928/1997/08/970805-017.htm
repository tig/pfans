A couple of you had asked me to let them know if I managed to fix the 
cold start/ driveability problem I'm having on my 85. So far I'm no 
closer to the problem unfortunately but thought an update might be of 
interest. Jim Stadter had advised that I get a book called "How to Tune 
and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection" so I rushed off to my local bookstore 
and picked up a copy. A good read which gives a good deal of insight. 
Thanks for the suggestion. Armed with the info in the book (I now know 
just about enough to be dangerous) and renewed enthusiasm I spent a bunch 
of hours troubleshooting over the weekend.

I systematically fixed anything that looked like it might cause a vacuum 
leak. I've heard from more than one source (including the book) that such 
"false air" leaks can cause all kinds of problems. Boy that car has a lot 
of hoses. In general I found few problems (after fixing some leaks in the 
past) but did generate a couple of questions for all you smart guys out 
there. First, there is a Tee with hoses going to the oil filler, the 
intake manifold (probably not the correct term but I mean the fat 
inverted T shaped piece that feeds the intake runners on both sides), and 
another valve assembly (looks like a pressure regulator) mounted on the 
right hand side that I'm pretty sure is something to to with the vapor 
purging system. Anyway one leg of the Tee has an aluminum restrictor in 
it with a 1 or 2mm orifice. Question is which leg does it normally live 
in? I found it in the leg that goes to the (potential) vapor purge valve 
but past experience with such devices suggest that they normally go in 
line with the crankcase breather i.e. the line to the oil filler. Any 
thoughts? These hoses have definitely had some attention from a PO as 
they are of US origin and were not very neat until I fixed them up. My 
second question is about the vapor purge system itself. There is a vacuum 
line that feeds from the throttle to a temperature controlled valve at 
the back of the motor under the air cleaner. From there it feeds to what 
looks to be a fairly large plastic vacuum activated valve in a larger 
diameter hose that again appears to be part of the purge system. This is 
mounted on the right hand side in front of the reservoirs. The 
temperature controlled valve is closed when cold so is not part of my 
problem. When open (warm) it has some leakage but seems like it should 
have but the valve in the larger line does not hold a vacuum at all and I 
bet it should. Does anyone feel like taking the small vacuum control line 
off that valve, attaching a hose and sucking on it for me? 

I tested the throttle position sensor. what a bugger that is to get at. I 
found the full throttle switch was intermittent, I managed to pop the 
cover off the switch and spray some electronic cleaner in there followed 
by a switch contact cleaner and it now works just fine. I'll replace the 
switch when the car comes off the road for the winter. Fixing it seems to 
have improved, subjectively at least, full throttle performance. This 
seems logical enough but as the closed throttle switch was OK it didn't 
have anything to do with my cold start problem.

I checked the "Temp 2" sensor and it seems to have exactly the values the 
author of the above book suggests to be normal. I was really hoping this 
would be the obvious problem. No such luck. Another question if I may. 
There are 3 switches/ sensors in the area around the thermostat. One is 
the temp 2 sensor. One mounted on the intake manifold is a temperature 
operated switch that turns the cooling fan on (low speed) when it gets to 
about 100 degrees C. Given the cooling effect normally produced in the 
intake of normally aspirated motors, things would have to be real hot to 
activate that one I would have though but that's another discussion for 
another day. There is another that is in contact with coolant that 
measures as open circuit (wires removed). I assume that it is also an 
over temperature switch but nothing seems to happen if I short across it. 
(Do I recollect there being a different fuse for the high speed mode of 
the fan? If so perhaps its blown. I'll check this evening). I didn't want 
to drain a bunch of the coolant to pull this one off and test it but will 
do so if no one can tell me what its supposed to do or what it should 
measure.

The temperature sensor in the air filter box seems to be fine as the 
resistance changes with temperature.

Pulled all the plugs for a look see. They look just how the text books 
say they should. Gaps were spot on. Distributors and rotors look fine. 

I'm now decidedly stumped. The MAF sensor has a temperature sensor in it 
but from what I read its more to do with the correct operation of the 
sensor itself rather than compensation for external air temperature. 
Presumably the sensor in the air filter box fulfills that function. I 
don't think an air temp sensor would be my problem anyway as the air temp 
will not change that much other than picking up a few degrees en route 
through the intake plumbing when the engine is hot. I'm now leaning 
towards bad wiring but without a manual set that will be a challenge. Can 
anyone tell me which terminals on the computer are for the temp 2 sensor?

Sorry this is so long and obtuse. It started of a simple no luck yet 
message and progressed from there. As always, any thoughts and insights 
would be appreciated.

Colin
