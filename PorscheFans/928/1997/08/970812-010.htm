Because its slowest point is about 3500 rpm in second - say 40 mph -
so third would be nowhere.

The curve is increasing radius, positive camber, 180+ degrees, and
uphill after the apex. So you can use all the power you've got (well,
all the power I've got, anyway) on the way out. But it's so long
that you use the whole reasonable portion of the torque curve and
then some. The alternative would be to change the line a bit, so
that I could straighten out mementarily for the upshift.
