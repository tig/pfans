Moira,

  The S4 started in '87 and ran until '91.  The '87-'88 S4 could be either
  5-speed or auto.  It gets a bit tricky for '89 and I'm not even positive
  that I've got the details right but here goes:  in '89 you could get an
  S4 in 5-speed or auto, BUT (I believe it was late in the model year) you
  could also get a GT which came ONLY as a 5-speed.  I think Porsche was
  pulling one of their infamous mid-year changes which is why the GT was
  available in '89 as an '89 model even though it wasn't planned to be
  introduced until '90.  Kind of like the late '86 928 S models which 
  came equipped with the good S4 brakes that weren't planned to be
  introduced until the S4 bowed in '87.
  
  The GT has approx 326hp while an S4 is 316hp.  From '90-'91 (there were
  officially no '92 928s imported to the States) the choices were only
  S4 (auto) or GT (5-speed).  I believe the '90-91 S4 is the same as the
  '87-'89 S4 with an auto.  Compared to the S4, the '89-91 GT had higer-perf
  cams, sport suspension, wider wheels (forged 8x16f, 9x16r in '89; cast
  7.5x16f 9x16r in '90-91), electronic limited-slip, and probably a few
  other performance oriented goodies that I can't recall. 
  
  Limited slip was available as an option on the S4, but at least from
  '87-89, it was not electronically controlled.  Not sure if it got the
  electronic GT-type LSD after that.
  
  Also, '90 was when dual airbags were introduced in the 928.  As far as
  which car to go for, it's a tradeoff.  I like the '89 GT because of the
  forged and wider wheels, but the '90-'91 have airbags, so there is some
  attraction there.  You could always update to the forged rims _if_ you
  can find them - very rare.
  
  As far as what to watch out for, proper maintenance and corresponding
  records are probably top priority.  And within the realm of maintenance,
  timing belt replacement is probably the most critical.  I'd spring for
  the $$$ to get this done if there was any question as to if or when
  it had ever been changed.  A broken t-belt will cost you an engine.
  Evaluate any replacement parts that have been used on the car.  Porsche
  replacement or OEM replacments are ok, but if you see Pep Boys or 
  Western Auto stuff on it, walk away.
  
  When I upgrade to a GT (yep - I want the same model you're looking at),
  I'll spend the money to get the best I can for my budget and try to
  keep about $2-3K around for the inevitable repairs that the car will
  need just after you take ownership.  Once you get the bugs worked out,
  average cost of ownership, though high, is manageable if you do most
  of the work yourself.
  
  BTW, you have seen Phil's web page, right?  http://www.928s4vr.com
  Packed with good, accurate info and has links to Stephane's ever-growing
  FAQ.
  
  Good books are "928 Performance Portfollio", Devek's catalog (free - e-mail
  them at DEV928@aol.com), and Project 928 (good history of the car through
  development - available for $60 through Vasek-Polak Porsche - search for
  them on the web)
  
  Good luck with your search!
