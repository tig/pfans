 Brian,
I think James was referring to a smart charger in his post.

There are many full blown battery chargers with "smart" technology that will
only charge with the amount of current to safely charge the battery depending on
how discharged the battery is, and shut down automatically when the battery is
fully charged.

It makes more sense to me to buy a full blown smart Charger/Starter for around
$80-$100 than to buy a little battery saver for $50 plus the time and extra
wiring to hook it up properly. You can use the charger/starter for many things
and those little  battery savers for only one thing.

You can set the smart charger/starter out of the way in front of the spoiler and
hook to the remote start term. in seconds, instead of removing panels,changing
wiring etc. Plus I sure would hate to get a short from a charger/saver in my
fuse/relay/brain panel area, that is definitely the last place I would want a
meltdown.

Just a thought ;-)
