Leonard,

>My car's hatch lock will only turn CW, not CCW (left).

They may have started that in 89 along with the flashing LEDs in the top of the
door lock "posts"

 >I haven't seen any indication that my car has any factory security system
>(e.g., no M-code, no extra directions for keys to turn). Please tell me
>what to look for.

It is my understanding that Factory Alarms are standard on 928s from at least
84 and up.
The Factory alarms are passive and are automatically activated when you lock
your doors with the Master key.
Take a look under the hood at the passenger side fender flange above your shock
mount. You should see a "plunger" switch. That is the hood switch for the alarm.
Also check your owners manual it will tell you about the operation.

NOTE: Make sure you use the Master Key during the following Tes
t, the red "valet" key does
not activate the alarm.

Test Procedure:

1- Roll down your drivers side window.
2- Close door and lock as normal from outside with master key.
3-Wait 5 seconds
4- reach in through open window and turn the manual rotary door lock knob to
unlock door
5- open the door from outside.
6- All hell should break loose, i.e., horn blaring, parking lights flashing, and
your fuel and/or ignition computer is deactivated.
7- You have to use the key in the door to cancel alarm.

If this doesn't work you have a bad alarm brain or relay box.
