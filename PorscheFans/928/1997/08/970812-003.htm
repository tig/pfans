Porsche Fans......


	recently my I've been recieving a "toothed belt service"
indication on my 89 928S4.  I dropped a line to the local
Porsche dealer and he mentioned worst case was a new belt (~11
hours and parts!!!!).  The indication only seems to come around
when I accelerate quickly, and it comes and goes.  Has anyone had
any experience replacing this belt?

Secondly, as with others in the group I've been having some problems
with my cruise control.  However, from the other problem descriptions
floating around, my problem sounds unique.....  The result of the
problem is that my antilock system in the left front wheel activates
at normal speeds without stepping on the brakes!  I can feel the
pulsating action of the pads when the system kicks in.  I can recreate
the problem in one of two ways.  First, while above the minimum
cruise control speed I try to activate the cruise control.  This sends
the antilock system into a tizzy.....  Secondly, if I start the car
and shift the car into drive without stepping on the break to clear
the "brake light" indication on the console, the same antilock spasm
occurs within ~20 seconds....  Is this just a bad speed sensor on
my left front wheel, or is it the same vaccuum problem that is plaguing
so many of our friends????



Regards, and thanks in advance....
