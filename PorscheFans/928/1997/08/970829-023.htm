That's exactly what my mechanic told me. (The resistor pack theory).  My
problem is understanding why it didn't start happening until the last year?
 What would cause it to start happening now when it never did it before?

Mine only happens when the fan is on position #1 or 2.  Never in the "0" or
off position.  Also, never when I'm rolling 25 mph or faster, even in
position #1 or 2.

We or I should say he, changed the resistor & it still happens.
