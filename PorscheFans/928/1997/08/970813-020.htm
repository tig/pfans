I've noticed that the Automotion Car of the Month is most often a 914,
followed by 911s. In fact, only my convertible has appeared to represent
the V8 contingency.

I am the designer and webmaster for the site, and we are looking for
Automotion customer cars. We prefer cars that have Automotion equipment
(like Weltmeister springs) or accessories. First priority goes to
competition cars with 'Automotion' windshield or nose graphics.

If you have a car that Automotion has helped you with, and you have a story
to tell, and a great photo, e-mail it to me (minimum 300 x 150 pixels, rgb)
and write it up.

If your car is chosen, you get a $25 Automotion gift certificate.

Automotion also awards a $25 gift certificate for tech tips. E-mail those
to automo@aol.com
