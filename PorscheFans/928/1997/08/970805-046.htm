My car has always run flawlessly until today.  Today I came home to
feed my cats dinner, and then I was meeting a friend for dinner.  So I
go out to the car, turn the key, and the starter cranked, but it wouldn't
start.  It seemed like a dying battery kind of a thing, because after
trying to start it for several minutes (not continuously!), the lights on
the dash started to fade a bit, so I stopped.  I took another car to
dinner, and when I returned a few hours later, I tried again, with no
success. 

I then proceeded to jump the car (with my '66 Dodge - how embarrasing!),
and got it started.  This is now 6 hours after it first wouldn't start, so
the
engine is completely cool.  I backed the car into the garage and shut
it down.  As soon as I got out of the car, I noticed the fans were still
running, which I thought quite odd since the engine was totally cool.
I let them run for a minute or two to see if they'd stop, and they didn't.

So, my theory is, the fans aren't shutting off like they're supposed to,
and it drained the battery to a point where it couldn't crank the starter
well enough.  1) Is this a good guess?  2) What the should I do about
it, other than take it to the dealer to have it checked out?  Has anybody
had a similiar experience?

To stop the fans from running, I just opened the hood which cuts them off.

Sigh, and thanks in advance for any information you can give me,
