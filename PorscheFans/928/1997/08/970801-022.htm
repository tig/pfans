Thanks! Great tip.

Anyone know of any other products that actually keep out the UV? Brian =
Buxton?

I can't see how it couldn't, in both, but I don't have any evidence as =
to the relative difference, and so I don't know which would last better =
if cared for. I suspect leather is more sensitive to abuse.  But if I had=
 to bet, and I may, I would still lean toward vinyl out-lasting leather =
if both treated well.

 My pillars are as new, best I recall at this moment. Are your pillars =
leather? My 81 928 P isn't here at the moment so I can't go look, but I =
thought they are plastic. Vinyl? I am talking about the pillars on either=
 side of the windshield.



Where the leather (I presurme leather.) abuts the pillars, the leather =
is faded, actually kind of reddened, and the pillars are not. So, if they=
 are covered in some kind of sun resistant leather (is there such a thing=
?), I want to recover my dash in it. If not, there's another bit of evide=
nce in favor of vinyl lasting longer.

Can anyone enlighten us on variations in vinyl quality vs lasting?

Anyone know of any sun blocker product for vinyl?

Are you saying he will do all that for $350 + $275 =3D $625? That seems =
too good to be true. We are talking about a 928? I got a quote to reuphol=
ster just one bucket seat in leather, in another Caddy, from two upholter=
ers. One at $800, one at $875. At that time, I called a couple of places =
in Hemmings re hides. Best I could do: $450 for a 1/2 hide. Does his $275=
 include R&R the dash?

The local guy who gave me the $1200 near-estimate on the same things your=
's is quoting (except the pillars) has seemed reasonable on other work =
and quotes, and has a thriving business here in car, boat and furniture =
reupholtering. He is Mr. Ambercrombe (I forget the first name), owner of =
New Albany Auto Trim, of New Albany, Indiana, accross the Ohio from Louis=
ville, Kentucky.

Can you tell us who your guy is?

Can you tell us the source of his leather? My impression so far is that =
there is a whale of a difference in leathers.

Another fine tip. Thanks again. I had noticed the double stictches but =
had no idea not every machine could duplicate them, and that is very impo=
rtant. If I got waves, no show judge would miss it, and I and my wife wou=
ld hate it. I would just have to go elsewhere and pay to have it done ove=
r again.

You may have just saved me $1200!   :-))

We shall see if Mr. Ambercrombe has a frencher, eh? I take it your guy =
has one?

Can you tell us when you are going to have yours done and where you are. =
I would like to see it, preferably before we do ours.

Will
