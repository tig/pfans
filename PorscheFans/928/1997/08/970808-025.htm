Brian,

Big job...quite pricy...course I had many other things done at the same time
so my bill was inflated by other stuff too, but my mechanic (has a 911 and
928 of his own, and is Porsche trained) did say that it is a total pain in
the butt.  All of the top of the motor has to come out...ie all of the intake
stuff.  I think that is the biggest part of the job is R/R of all that stuff.
 Once that is out of the way the valve cover gaskets are pretty easy to
change.  Don't remember how much of the bill was that but I would guess it
was more than $500.

See ya'
