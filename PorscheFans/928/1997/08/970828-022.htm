    I'm a newcomer to the list but its the first thing I look at each
day.

    I have a black 88 S4 -- which I ordered from the factory (I really
wanted an all leather mahogany interior)  which I and a first class
mechanic have kept in perfect shape for almost ten years. Unfortunately,
the mechanic (we're in LA) has closed his doors and I'm an
auto-illiterate;  the car has 40,000 very easy miles on it.

    Today, after driving about an hour, I parked ny car and went inside
for about 15 minutes. When I tried to start it up, the ignition was
entirely dead -- not a sound. The power windows, radio, and seats were
working so I don't think its  a dead battery. My guess -- and as that
guess may show, I'm auto-illiterate -- is that its the relay to the
elctronic ignition.  Do any of you have a more educated guess?

    Also, if it is the relay (or whatever else you think it may be) can
I jump start it to take it to the mechanics or do I have to flat bed
it?  And despite a couple of great recommendations for a new LA mechanic
(thanks, guys) I'm still open toany more.

    Thanks a lot.  Mike Bergman
