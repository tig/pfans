     Last weekend I participated in the SCCA Seattle National Tour Solo-2 
     Auto-x event at a Boeing parking lot in Kent, WA. Stock 928's are 
     classed in A-Stock which has been a popular class in SCCA for 1997. At 
     Seattle there were 12 entrants including 4-Toyota MR2 Turbos, 2-BMW 
     M3's, 3-944S2's, 1-968, 1-944 Turbo, and me. I was pleased with my 
     result of finishing 6th being only my 3rd auto-x driving this car. I 
     have auto-xed with SCCA and PCA for 10 years so I do have some 
     experience, but getting a handle on this beast (car setup and driving) 
     will take some more time.
     
     The courses were designed by a Miata driver so they didn't allow me to 
     take advantage of my extra horsepower, but did offer a good driving 
     and car control challenge. Congratulations to local Bill Buetow in his 
     944S2 with his large margin of victory. Bill is a National calibre 
     driver as he has placed 2nd and 3rd driving a 944S2 the past 2 years 
     at SCCA Solo-2 Nationals in Kansas when the car was in B-Stock. He was 
     first and I was second in P9 at the '95 Portland Parade driving event 
     when I had my S2. I learn a lot watching him out drive me in similar 
     cars.
     
     One of the announcers, Scotty White, made reference to my car as the 
     ZR-1 of Porsches (he is a ZR-1 Corvette and a Porsche owner) because 
     of its motor and size. Not many 928's auto-x so I drew a fair amount 
     of curiosity. The balance and handling of the car is great, but it 
     still feels big and heavy trying to throw it through the tight 
     slaloms. I'm looking forward to auto-xing in some of the more open 
     courses.
