I recently experimented with re-dying some leather. I had a center
console in blue leather that I wanted to re-do in black. I went to my
local shoemaker and was able to get the required products.

First, remove the seat from the car. The chemicals can do a number on
anything you care to spill them on. Also, your brain will thank you for
doing this in a well ventilated area.

Second you strip the color off. Yes, I know, you're not changing colors,
but in order for the new dye to soak in and adhere properly you need to
remove the old dye and open the pores of the leather. Since black is
black and there shouldn't be a matching problem, you're best bet is to
strip a defined area such as defined by a border of welting or
stitching. You can probably get away with not doing the entire seat.
Soak an area with the remover, then wipe with a rough cloth. Soak again,
rub with a toothbrush and wipe again. Repeat until the bare leather is
exposed. I had good luck using a "toothbrush" from an auto parts store
which has brass bristles.

After drying completely, you can apply the dye. With black there should
be no problem with trying to apply an even coat - just dab it on, wait a
few seconds, then wipe the excess off. You may want to do this a couple
of times to make sure all areas are covered evenly, but don't overdo it
- the leather will only absorb so much, after which, you may as well
just pour the dye into rag...  Also, don't let the dye dry on the
surface before wiping. After you are satisfied, get a clean buffing rag
and buff the leather until you have a nice, even low-sheen surface. Then
let it dry for a few hours.


THIS LAST STEP IS IMPORTANT - DON'T SKIP IT
The last step is to put a protector on the leather. The kind I got came
in a spray can. Just spray on an even coat, wait a minute, then spray it
again. Let it dry for an hour or so, then buff up the leather and
re-install the seat. The protector seals the leather and prevents it
from scuffing and rubbing off.I don't have the name brands of the three
products I used right now (I'm at work), but if you're interested I send
you that information.

I'm not sure about the newer cars, but on my 78 the lenses can be
replaced individually. Call 928 International at (714) 632 9288. They
have a web site at www.928intl.com
