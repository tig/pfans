"....Does anyone have any ideas on what problem the installer might have

  my Temp Sensor II seem to be within spec when read directly off the 
sensor...) "

Jim

The temp II sensor (on my 85 at least) has 2 thermistors in it with one 
end of each being connected to ground via the shell of the sensor. One of 
the wires goes to the injection computer and the other to the ignition 
computer. The thermistors have a higher value when cold which tells the 
injection to richen up the mixture and probably (I say probably here as 
theory and practise are not always the same thing and I haven't verified 
this as yet) tells the ignition to advance the timing a bit as a cold 
engine can stand bit more advance and needs it for best efficiency. Your 
rogue resistor is effecting one of those two functions. You are getting 
more fuel or perhaps more advance than the designers intended. This could 
be an attempt to hide another problem such as a vacuum leak or perhaps a 
misguided attempt at improving performance. The colour bands you saw 
should actually be read the other way around i.e. red black orange gold 
which tell us its a 20K ohm 5% device. This is a very high value compared 
to the value of the thermistors so one of your computers will think your 
engine is very cold all the time. I'm not at home at present so don't 
have my reference material but 20K will surely translate to something way 
below freezing. If memory serves, the thermistors are normally 200 to 300 
ohms with a warmed up engine and around 2 or 3K at 60F or so. I've got to 
believe that the resistor is in the ignition circuit as I doubt the 
engine would even start when hot with a value like that in the injection 
circuit. You would also be measuring fuel consumption as GPM!
As you say, this would not be a standard item. I would certainly short it 
out and see what happens.

Hope this helps?

Colin
