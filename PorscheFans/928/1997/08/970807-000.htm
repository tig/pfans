This _is_ Porsche we're dealing with! :^)

The following is based on me looking at the manuals, rather than knowing
for certain.

Pictures of the engine bay in the L-Jetronic and LH-Jetronic models show a
distinctive looking "Pressure damper" sitting just forward of the oil
filler. My car certainly doesn't have one of those, but it has a "Warm-up
Control" unit in about the same place. This same control unit is pictured
in the hose plan for the K-Jetronic system.

Manual pages refer to:

"USA/Japan from 1980 with L-Jetronic"
"1980/81/82/83 with AFC"

So what you have guessed (Euro models stayed with K-Jetronic right through
until the LH-Jetronic came out in '84) appears to be true.

That's good to know from my part, as I now know not to buy-in '83 injection
parts from the USA for my car!

I learn something new every day.
