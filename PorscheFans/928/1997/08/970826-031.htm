Another source for used private-party vehicles are the so-called
"Park and Sell" lots that seem to be springing up in more and more
cities.  At the one I go to, you can start the engine and operate all of
the accessories, but you will be shot if you put the car in gear.  The
nice thing about these kinds of lots is that there's NO pressure to buy
the car.  You can take all the time you want inspecting a car as long as
you don't begin taking the car apart right there on the lot.  You'd have
to buy it first if you wanted to see what makes it tick.  This is sort
of getting off the subject of 928's, so I'll end this note what I saw 2
weeks ago at one local P & S lot:  a 1989 Porsche 928 S4.  Just under
70,000 miles.  $18,200 or best offer.  Very nice interior.  Custom
(i.e. "aftermarket") Stereo system.  Engine sounded nice, too.  
And the car was on the lot for a whopping 4 DAYS before it sold.  (Other
cars sit there for 4 MONTHS and then some.)

Just another angle to private-party used cars.
