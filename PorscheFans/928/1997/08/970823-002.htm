From your mouth to the (market) god's ear.

However, I do not agree with your assessment.

The 928 is considered a market failure. Some of the later models were
manufactured in the hundreds. Yes, they are rare, but the market never did
understand or want them in the first place.

What I'm seeing is a market split, with the very last of the cars holding
on to 45% or so of their sticker price, but the older cars going at 15-25%.

We all know these are basically reliable cars, but once the odo goes over,
say 120K, they have very little market value. Here in southern California,
I have seen 928s in the $3-4K range that need $4-7K worth of work because
the P.O. was a 'bargain hunter' who really couldn't afford (or rationalize)
the maintenance cost.

In my experience, Porsche dealers will not accept 928 trade-ins above
'giveaway' prices if at all.

928 International is more and more often buying complete running cars for
salvage simply because the owners cannot sell them above salvage price of
$2-3K.

This market perception problem is one reason my friends in Minneapolis are
making 928 Spyders. they can buy good 928s dirt cheap. ($7K for a good S4
two years ago).
