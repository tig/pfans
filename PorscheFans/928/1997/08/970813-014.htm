Well, I didn't win the "Project 928" book awarded as a door prize by
DEVEK on August 2.  Unfortunately, DEVEK has now exhausted their supply
of this nice book which documents the development of the 928 from 1971
through 1977.  And, it is long out of print.  The 1st (and only) ed. was 
published in 1977 and apparently never again.

I don't give up easily, so I started calling book sellers and Porsche
dealers.  I found a supply (at $59.95 each, plus tax & shipping) at
Vasek Polak Porsche-Audi-VW, 199 Pacific Coast Highway, Hermosa Beach,
CA 90254 (310)376-0935 and bought three copies in case a couple of the
local S.F. 928ers wanted a copy.  I DID NOT clean them out, and, as of
8/4/97, Vasek Polak still had a bunch of copies in stock.  Their stock
number was WAP662000. Perhaps other dealers might still have a few
somewhere on a back shelf also.
