Ouch - that hurts! I feel like I have to become the "Leonard" for the German
Language when I read this...

Well, if you want to translate "There is no substitute" correctly, it would
read:

     "Es gibt keinen Ersatz" (Note the difference in GRAMMAR!!!)

However, "Ersatz" also means "replacement". Imagine how odd the tagline would
flow if it was: "There is no replacement". That's about how "well" the German
translation flows - not qualified for big time advertising use...

Here is another one: In Excellence October 97, page 116 you can find an ad of
"Supercharging of Knoxville", calling their "Black Cat": "Schwarz Katze".
Someone actually went through the trouble of creating an ad without
consulting anyone knowledgable in the foreign language they were using (It
should say: "Schwarze Katze"). I wonder, if their supercharging kits are as
"professionally engineered" as their ad...

Sorry for rambling on about this with my own broken English. I'm just saying:
If you can't do it right, don't bother with it, or ask for help... (same
thing applies to 928 repairs at home, I believe)

Amen.

Subject: Storin the 928 for extended periods CONT.

        I got some feed back on my post about maintaining the power and
keeping the better in good shape while storing a 928.  I'd like to say that
buying a "battery tender" or any other type of battery cycler is usually a
waste of money.  I've found that just a simple trickle charger is JUST fine.
I've run a trickle charger on the Studebakers for up to 2 years (personally)
and being able to jump in it and drive away, electrically.  There are thoes
smart chargers out there that could cost between $120-$600, but experience
has shown me that the "smart" circuits in them are not very reliable.  Some
will actually shut down if some thing causes a spike or voltage drops accros
the battery whitch may be just a bad connection or some device in the car.
As well the oler chargers will take over current loads better, and not tend
to fail after a few jolts like the smart type.  I'm still convinced that
just a simple charger with NO control devices in them, only a switch to
control, trickle, charge, and starting is all that one needs.  I'm not
saying that the new chargers are no good, but if making a GOOD buy is in
your nature than this is the way to go.  Although if you want nothin but
first class for your car then go ahead and buy the smart chargers, but
you'll have difficulties and a shorter charger life.

Experience is my basis.

Don't know if you're aware of the following: The 928 without any spoilers had
a lower drag coefficient BACKWARDS than in the regular forward direction.
Porsche engineers found that out some day when playing around after a long
day in the wind tunnel.

However, the downforce wasn't too good (it rather was an "upforce")...

Subject: Preservation Storage of a 928

        When I first started storing cars it was costing a fortune to heat a
garage over the winter.  So I ran a simple experiment, I took a bare piece
of sheet metal and placed it in the garage for one winter when it was heated
at 21 deg. celcius.  And then the same thing another year only with a
dehumidifier this time.  After the fact it plates showed signifigantly less,
as in harly no corrosion on the plate that was dehumidified, where as the
heated plate was definitly coroded.  It also cost about 1/4 of the heater to
opperate the dehumidifier.  One startling thing I found was that about every
other day the machine would remove 2 litres of water from the two car
garage! Although it is best to have both going, but isn't really nessasary.
In a two car garage that's insualted it should stay about 10 deg. celcius,
atleast on the coast of BC Canada, due to the heat generated by the
compressor in the unit, however it is relativly safe to let it go below
zero, as long a the leather doesn't mind.
        As for the rest of the car,  it is a good idea to jack it up and get
the weight off the springs and tires, as well as stop moisture from creaping
up the tyres onto the undercarage.  Fuel preservation additives, they do
work, but a good tank of gas about 1/2, NOT FULL, NOT less than 1/8, can sit
for about 2 years as well. But if it has gone bad and the car won't fire
than top up the tank with some new stuff when you go to start it.  AC
systems, well, the only know preservation I know of is to start the car
every month, 2 or more in the winter months, and run the AC.  This keeps the
seals good.  As well it is a good idea to run the engine about every 2
months, doesn't have to drive, just run.  As well on a 928, having lots of
moving parts, it is a good idea to run the car once a month anyways and make
shure every thing still can move.  Catching freezes in components in the
early stages can be perswaded, rather than having it replaced later.
        Although if your not mechanically inclined and just like to see the
928 in the garage, then the most improtant things to do is to...

        A: Disconect the battery
        
        B: Get the car off the wheels

        C: Attempt to run the car every month

Thoes can keep virtually any car in good shape for about, 2-6 years without
hitting the road.  Any longer than that you may require some maintenance
done to be in good shape again.  As well don't forget to change your fluids
even if they were new when the car was parked!

Experience teaches all lessons!

	Didn't this already happen? I thought I read an article
	somewhere about the residents of a Chicago tenement house
	suing the Housing Authority in Federal Court over the
	Authority's use of cameras in the hallways and stairwells
	of certain "high-risk" housing projects. If I remember 
	correctly, the court ruled in favor of the Housing

Did any of you see the Volkswagen commercial with the 928 and the VW Golf
(I think)?  It showed a big bug buzzing around over the highway as a Golf
approached it.  The bug did a few flips and twirls as it sailed over the
Golf's windshield but was none the worse for the encounter.  Then a Porsche
928 appeared heading straight for the bug.  SPLAT!  They bragged about how
the aerodynamics of the Golf are superior to the Porsche 928.

If I remember right, the original 928 has a poor aerodynamic profile -
something like .42 Cd.  As the years went by, Porsche added the front and
rear spoilers and then such things as automatic flaps in the grill to
improve aerodynamics.  I guess it wasn't too bad by 1977 standards, but by
today's standards, it's not very aerodynamic.  It sure LOOKS like it is,
though.

The car was a Hundai.  Pronounced like Sunday.  I thought it was a very
clever ad.  It said "This is what the Porsche 928 looks like to a bug.
ZZZZZZZZZzz SPLAT!  Now this is what a Hundai looks like & whoosh, it just
flipped & twirled just like you said!  Pretty funny I thought!

	That doesn't sound like any PCA event I've ever attended.

Remember last summer the discussion we had about a Porschefans t-shirt?
With the various get-togethers some people have been having, I thought
it'd be a great way to identify us espcially at PCA events. As for what
the shirt would look like...I've considered asking Pete if we could use
the Porschefans logo from the web page (it's really sharp) on the back of
the shirt. On the front, how about that top 50 list of Ways You Know You
Have Too Much Horsepower we bandied around last Fall. Of course, we'd have
to trim it down quite a bit. What do ya'll think? Any interest?

Sounds to me like FOLINO might benefit from a new service provider.  Throw
out where you live, and hopefully some of the others on the list will throw
some suggestions (or better yet WHO TO AVOID) your way.

By the way, I live in Phoenix Arizona and have had good experiences with
Beck's Porsche Shop.  I've stayed late into the evening, way past closing
time, talking with the owner and his son about Porshes.  Also, they're the
ones mentioned in the local auto trader by name a lot ("Transmission rebuilt
by Beck's") in hopes of increasing value.  I'd be interested in hearing of
other service providers in my area, since Beck's doesn't do upholstery,
body/paint, etc.

thanks!

I have a Schauer HR2012C charger.  It is advertised as a 2amp automatic
charger.  When I store my 928 I usually put this on a timer & have it come
on for 2 to 3 hours a day.  Any thoughts on this?

Subject: oil pressure

<<What I've experienced:

'84 S,  oil unknown 1.5 bar idle, 5 bar normal speeds

'84 S,  Castrol synthetic 2  bar idle, 5 bar normal  (20 - 50wt)



'90 GT,  oil unknown 2 bar idle, 5 bar normal

'90 GT,  Mobil 1 2.5 bar idle, 5 bar normal (15 - 50wt)



With near 2 gallons of oil in the case, it takes awhile to heat to

operating range.  During that time, pressure stays 5 bar (of course).

When the water temp reads slightly above half, then pressure starts to

come down to 4 bar, etc.    Putting fresh oil in the car is one of my

favorites so I don't mind  frequent changes (but should start driving

the car less now - I've put miles on it already! Ahh, summer!).

I just fixed my oil pressure sending unit.  I remember a lot of talk about
this a couple of months ago.  Instead of replacing it, I just knocked it
gently to loosen any "stuff" in the galleys , then removed the harness and
sprayed it and the sending unit with brake clean.  I reinstalled and finished
the oil change with Mobil 1 15W-50 (On Sale at K-Mart for $3.60 quart, plus
$3.60 rebate on a case).  The guage works fine now.  I believe it was all of
the crud on the harness contacts. It runs 5.0 bar at warmup, then in gear it
wil fall to about 2.5 bar.  From 800 RPM upt to about 1300 RPM it climbs
gradually, above 1500 it is pegged.  I know this may be late (I still haven't
read all the digests from last week.

Ken,
Let me get this straight, you want to go +3!  The first question is
why?  If it's looks, then I can't objectively argue with you.  However,
let me point out, that when you go from 15 to 17" wheels, your tiny
brake discs will look pretty silly.  With 18's on, yikes!  There will be
>1.5" of radial clearance between the caliper and wheel.

Now, if you're doing it for performance, there is really no point as
I've been told.  You gain a lot going from 15 to 16 and a little going
from 16 to 17's but, since many DOT approved race tires aren't available
in the best 17" sizes, the 16's seem to be the wheel of choice for the
track and 17's for the street.  I think most of what you get with 17's
and 18's is a whole lot of harshness.  Those 18" tires are really
expensive too - you could get great 16's for less and do better things
with the $'s - like improving the driver for example.  If $'s aren't
your particular problem (congratulations BTW), then why not upgrade to a
GT/GTS?

My view,

(BTW, you actually increase your moment of inertia and your acceleration
will decrease slightly with the 18's.)

Your phonedials are just 7" wide, actually. If you take them off, you
will see the size and offset stamped on the inside. I can tell you
that 8" wheels with 245-45/16 tires, 52mm offset, barely fit inside
the wheel arches on my car, with 21mm spacers in place. So if your car
doesn't have the spacers, you might fit a 9" rim in there - it doesn't
look like there's a clearance problem on the inside, unless I'm
overlooking something.

Thanks for letting me know that Amsoil opened its own Web site. I expect
that their information about their products will be more current than that
published by their dealers, one of whose sites was the source of the info I

I think the bottom line is that Amsoil, like other makers of high quality

Not limited to the 928, the general caution with large diameter wheels, at
least when paired with tires whose overall diameter is about the same as
stock, is that the resulting very short sidewalls expose your rims to curbs
and relatively uncushioned whacks from potholes. Be sure you're ready to
take the extra car required to avoid bending and breaking those sinful new
rims.

>Painted with 234/40-18 ZR fronts...

...just a silly millimeter narrower than a known size.

>and 295/35-18 ZR rear tires

No matter what wheel offset you use, and without the additional
complication of lowering the car, you're unlikely to get anything wider
than 275 mm to fit inside the rear wheel wells without significant
bodywork. I have GTS-spec wheels and tires all around on my car (no
spacers), and there's not very much clearance left with the 255-section
rears. Devek sells trick wheels which will carry 275s without interference
at front and rear.

>the wheel fitment guide for the 10" wide "Sin" wheel for REAR use states
>"928 S4 only!"  Flame away, but does the S4 have flared lips on the rear
>arches?

Not on the outside, but the wheel house inside may be roomier than on
earlier cars, given that the S4 was the first 928 model with wider (by 20
mm) rear tires.

>Would it be better to give up entirely on the 10" width for the rear, and go
>same-size all four corners?

No. Particularly if you've gotten some extra power out of your engine, it's
useful to have wider wheels and tires at the rear. Just keep the dimensions
under control. If you must run 18" rims, go ahead and use the 10" width but
"paint" it with a more moderate tire (e.g., 265/35x17, a size you can get
in Michelin Pilot SX MXX3 or Bridgestone S-02, two of the very best tires
available).

You will be startled at the improvement wrought by an arrangement like
this, or even a 17" GTS-spec setup (in which "Technology"-style wheels are
available if you want something snappier looking than the stock "C2" style;
check Wheel Enhancements at http://www.wheelenhancement.com/). Top-grade
modern tires with short sidewalls are enormously crisper and stickier than
anything available when your car was built.

I read somewhere (so it must be true, right?) that the 928 S4 has a

I don't remember where I read that, but I'll find it and post the article.

So, does anyone know the cd for each of the 928 body styles?

I have a couple of relatively minor problems I can't figure out and need
some ideas.

1) The front seat on the passenger side will no longer move.  This
applies to both the forward/reverse as well as back adjustments.  It was
working fine a short time ago.  I checked the fuse - it's ok.  I also
checked the switches on the seat.  They are all getting power.  Any
ideas?

2) The automatic release for the rear trunk no longer seems to work.  It
was working fine and just seemed to stop doing so. When you 'pull' the
switches, the motor works, but the lid does not open.  I tried adjusting
it up and down, still no luck.  I sprayed it with WD-40 to make it run a
little smoother.  Still no luck.  There must be some trick to its
deceptive simplicity.  Any ideas on this?

Thanks,

Hello everyone,
   not a good day today. I was driving my just washed 928 GT today when this
lady ran a stop sign and hit me hard in the front passenger side by the
wheel.  Heavy damage to the bumper,quarter panel, headlight... it looks like
the engine compartment got damaged from the impact also. Not to mention heavy
frame damage, the drivers side door rubs with the front quarter panel and I
was hit on the passenger side! I'm not sure of the damage bills yet but will
find out Monday. She was at fault so her insu. carrier better cover all of
this.  One other thing is my 2 week old rim was badly damaged also. I was
physically ok from the accident though.

Never seen it. But did you know that a VW and Porsche dealer actually built a
widened VW Golf based on a complete 928 chassis, engine and interior? That
was a real stealth speeding car...
 
>> If I remember right, the original 928 has a poor aerodynamic profile -

Indeed the 928 aerodynamics were not that efficient initially. Keep in mind
that the design was developped in the EARLY 1970ies - years before the car
went into production and at a time when everybody else built "boxy" cars. The
round rear seems to cause a lot of turbulences in the air, reducing
efficiency. Also, the wide tires and intensive cooling requirements probably
limited aerodynamics. However, Posche (and also Mercedes) did a lot of wind
tunnel testing for keeping dirt off the windows etc - and we keep hearing the
positive results from other list members.

Leonard asked why the car had no downforce when tested backwards. Well, first
I'm not an aerodynamics expert, and second I have just heard this as a rumor
and don't know any specifics. 

However, cars with low rears generally seem to have a tendency for uplift -
that's why so many of today's performance cars have a wedge-like shape or
rear spoilers. 

This reminds me of a guy in Germany who reversed the body on his Beetle on
the chassis. Wherever he drove people were scared to death, and he even made
it on TV...

Well, don't try that with your 928 - you'll seriously compromise high speed
stability (see above)... ;-)
