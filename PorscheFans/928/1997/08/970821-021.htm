Find a copy of the February European Car magazine if possible. It has a
great article on the replacement of 911 rear wheel bearings. I used the
same steps to replace the left rear bearing on my 928 without taking the
entire rear suspension apart and without having to heat anything. The whole
process took about 5 hours. 
Check with Automotion to see if they have the bearing tool for removal and
replacement for the 928. They didn't when I called but the was early in the
year. I ended up making my own and it seemed to work just fine. 
I used a slide hammer that bolted to the wheel hub to pull the hub out of
the bearing.
I ordered bearings from a dealer in California for $19.50 a piece, they
normally go for around $100.00 ea. It pays to check the ads in Excellence
Magazine.

this is how I did my rear bearing:

1. jack the rear of the car up and rest it on jack stands
2. remove the wheel(s)
3. put it in gear if it's a standard and apply the parking brake
4. use a 3/4 drive breaker bar with the correct size socket to loosen the
axle nut
5. take it out of gear so you can spin the 1/2 shaft
6. apply the parking brake and loosen as many cv bolts as you can reach on
both ends,
   let off the parking brake, turn the 1/2 shaft to get to a few more
bolts, reapply    the parking brake, loosen, release brake, turn, ect...
7. release the parking brake and remove the caliper bolts 
8. suspend the caliper out of the way without pinching the brake line
9. remove the 1/2 shaft
10.remove the axle nut and push the axle shaft out of the hub
11.I removed the hub and rotor as a unit. I bolted a crows foot to the hub
and attached          a slide hammer. a couple good hits is all it took to
pull the hub out.
12.remove the spring clip 

Special tool time

13. install the correct size large washer on the bolt
14. insert the bolt through the bearing from the transmission side
15. feed the bolt through the bearing cup and install a washer and nut
16. tighten the nut finger tight making sure that the cup, bolt and large
washer are     square.
17. start tightening the nut, it will draw the bearing out
18. once the bearing is out clean the surface of the bearing housing
19. one of the inner races of the bearing was frozen to the wheel hub after
I pulled it         out. I had to use a gear puller to get it off.
20. go in reverse order to reassemble

Check the cv joints and boots, now is the best time to change them.

I hope this helps
