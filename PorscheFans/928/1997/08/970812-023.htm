"These two things sound like possibilities.  Is there any good way to 
fix them?  I'm not going to spend a lot of money as I plan to have 
the whole car repainted at some point.  I would even mess with it 
except that the spots are white and the car is black (VERY visible)."

I'm no paint expert so take my comments for what they're worth. Are you 
sure there's any black paint left to repair? I think you mentioned before 
that the damaged areas had a rough texture. If it is rough, the surface 
of the spot must be above or below the level of the surrounding paint? If 
its above, you clearly have something that has to come off but that would 
be pretty apparent and you would have fixed it by now. If its below the 
paint something has eaten into it and the paint is gone. Given the intent 
to paint the car anyway I might invest in a spray can as a temporary 
disguise if it were me. Of course, you could always drop by a body shop 
and ask what they think of the spots. There seems to be no shortage of 
shops willing to give free estimates and it might cost less than you 
think to have something way better than a spray bomb job.
