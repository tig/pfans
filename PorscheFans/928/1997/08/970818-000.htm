Nope - wrong guess... And I did not find any bullet holes either - yes, we're
in California ;-)

I still haven't figured out what it really was. I checked the battery in the
back, checked for fluid inside and under the car, and drove the car for about
2 hours today without any problems.

So I still wonder: what in this car can bust in the area between or behind
the seats? All there is is the rear evaporator of the AC. And when I tested
it briefly today, it still blew cold air. It sounded as if the "explosion"
had come from the inside, and was not a "thump" as you get when somthing hits
the body of the car. 

Can anybody solve this mystery?
