Hi Ken,
These are the mirrors that you see on the GTS otherwise known as teardrop
mirrors, you can buy them from porsche but they are expensive, I got mine
secondhand from a parts guy, for about 200-250 dollars (I got the large
fiberglass engine guard, the luggage compartment net and cover and the
mirrors for about 350 dollars, not bad!).
Yes they are heated and motorised, even have position sensors for the memory
settings.

Do you mean the whole mirror is flopping around or just the glass because
the mirrors get loose with time and need to be tightened up a little, takes
only two minutes.
It would probably be worthwhile repairing your old mirrors, I'd imagine it
would turn out a lot cheaper than new ones. Try some breakers yards for
newer ones.

Good luck anyway
