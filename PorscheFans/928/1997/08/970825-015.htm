I called this week-end on a similar '89 S4 auto - asking was $19,500.  I
think $25k is high for a car that is not outstanding.

>It was at a dealer here near Akron, Oh. I thought it was over-priced,

Dealers are high. You will find the better cars through individuals. 
All dealers descibe their cars as excellent.  Most are average. 
Remember that the average Porsche will/should be maintained to a
standard considered excellent for a lesser car.

>I really want a GT and it has to be a '89 or newer. Am I dreaming???

No, there are good cars available.  But, you must be patient. An
inexpensive start would be to purchase Issue #66, December 1996 of
Excellence magazine.  Back issues are available for $5.00 each (includes
P+H) from Excellence, P.O. Box 1529, Ross, CA 94957.  Bruce Anderson
does his usual fine job of describing the various models, years,
features, pitfalls, and market values of the 928s. 

Also, a web search on 928 will turn up a lot of interesting info. Be
sure to visit Phil Tong's web site, call or e-mail Marc & Susan at Devek
(they may have a customer who has a car for sale) and follow the basic
rule about searching for anything - tell everyone you know! You probably
already know the First Rule about buying a Porsche - buy the newest and
best example you can afford (easier said than done).

Since S4s and GTs were both sold in the US from 1989-91 the surefire way
to tell a real GT is that the engine is type M28.47 whereas the S4 is
type M28.42. Also, the GT has trans type G28.55 for the manual w/ltd
slip standard.

Porsche Market Letter, Classifieds2000 or a broker such as Brian could
also be helpful in locating your car.

>You guys don't always put down 911's, do you???

Nope, many of us previously owned or even currently own 911s. Just a
different Porsche.  Personally, I like all Porsches.

>Is that why you won't answer my questions???

Please don't feel slighted.  People don't answer unless they know the
answer, some will not reply to questions already being answered or found
in the archives. "Looking for a 928" is a fairly frequent question.
