I forgot a few items in my last posting.

In addition to all the 928 discussions at the event, we plan to sell "T"
shirts from "928 International" and "Devek Performance" as well as other
items provided by them. There will also be routine parts and equipment (ie.
filters, hood shocks, brake pads, etc.) for sale at the usual PCA
disacounted prices.

Moreover, I have designed a logo for the event and plan to sell quality polo
shirts. These polo shirts will be "Ash" in color with a dark blue colar and
cuffs. In my opinion, they will be attractive and reasonably priced for
event attendees at $30 for M & L and $32 for XL and XXL. For non-attendees
the cost will be $5 more to cover shipping and handling.

If you are unable to attend the event but would like to order a polo shirt,
please contact me by e-mail at: eds928s@erols.com or call me at:
(703)481-9252 before 10:00 p.m. eastern. Upon receipt of you request, I will
provide the address to send a check (made out to "PCA Potomac"). BTW, all
income goes to offset expenses incurred in the Potomac Region's 1997 social
program.

Thanks for allowing me this announcement. Happy motoring. Ed
