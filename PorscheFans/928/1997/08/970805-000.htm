Hi,
  After having two different mechanics refuse to change the oil in my
gearbox, I  decided to give it a whack myself.  What a miserable job!  I
haven't had this much fun since I pulled the engine on a Saab 99 outside in
5 degree weather (but  that is a story for a different list...)  

Draining the oil was pretty easy.  I picked up a 17mm wrench for VW tranny
for 5 bucks, and the plug came loose pretty easily.  The oil that came out
was the color of split pea soup!  I was glad to find not too many shavings
on the magnet in the plug (no gear teeth, springs or other chunky things).

  I couldn't fit an Allen key into the filler plug (and had no suitable
tool to cut the Allen key down), so I loosened it with a pair of
vise-grips.  Not finding a suitable pump, I bought a long length of vinyl
tubing and some brass couplings at home depot.  I used the coupling to fit
the hose in the filler  hole on the tranny.  (Why did Porsche make that
hole so small?)  

Now the fun part -- getting the oil into the tranny.  First, I stuck a
funnel on the end of tubing, holding it about four feet off the ground. 
That went way to slow, even with the oil heated.  (At one point, I made my
girlfriend hold the funnel.  She dumped a funnel-ful all over herself and
stopped talking to me for the rest of the evening :(   (I did this
procedure at her house, since I don't have any place suitable near my
apartment)

After some experimenting, I ended up sticking one of the brass couplings
into the nozzle of the oil bottle, the tubing into that and squeezing. 
Even this was problematic, as it dribbled, and if I squeezed too hard, the
coupling would pop out of the bottle.  After about 2.5 hours, I got the
last of oil in there.  I still need to top it off, because I only bought 4
quarts and I must've spilled about 1/2 a quart total, plus about 4.5 quarts
of old stuff came out (so much for going by the specs).

I took the car out last night to see if there was any improvement in
shifting smoothness with the new synthetic oil over the murky 15 year old
dino goo that was in there.  None what so ever!!!  Maybe this its because
I'm still 1/2 - 1 quart low, but right now I'm not impressed.  I'll see
when I top it off tonight.
