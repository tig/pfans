Dear thread followers,

LEATHER VS VINYL

Since my last post in re, I spoke to my favorite upholsterer and he said =
that if both leather and vinyl are properly cared for, leather will last =
longer. I have been thinking the opposite, and still I am not convinced. =
Further evidence: The door posts on my 928 appear to be vinyl, or some =
other plastic. And at the bottoms, they curve so as to get sun perpindicu=
lar to their
surface. They do not appear to be changed by the sun at all, whereas the =
leather is. However, I don't know what the PO did to either.

Any of you, unlike me, cared well for both in a nose to nose comparison =
for many years. What happened?

DYE

He also said that if you put denatured alcohol on before you spray it wil=
l take out the original color ( he didn't say to what % ) and then you =
will get a better result. He was referring to vinyl and I didn't ask abou=
t leather. He also said
that the original vinyl dashes, door panels etc. are sprayed after being =
molded. I would have
thought that the color was mixed in with the plastic before it was molded=
, wouldn't you?

J. P., as you may have read, I have been thinking about hiring someone =
to dye the entire green interior of a leather/vinyl/(carpet fiber unknown=
) Eldorado Caddy, 1972. Your post has moved me a bit further toward actua=
lly doing it. I am thinking it would look better if it wasn't all one sha=
de. Maybe 2, 3 or even 4 tones of tan/brown. Ya
think? Any of you ever dye an entire interior?

Also, the driver's seat on my 928 is damaged a bit, but only in one spot =
on both sides of a seam. I am wondering how it
would look if I replaced only the two damaged panels, instead of recoveri=
ng both front seats for a
perfect match, then treat both seats with denatured alcohol and dye the =
original color. Any of you ever do that?

Bumper sticker?:

COLOR TO DYE FOR!
