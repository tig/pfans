Joe,

As I continue to watch the market it seems that the price is still dropping
especially on the later models.  You will see GTS falling into the low $30k
range these days even.  The mid '80's cars seem pretty stable at about $10k
for nice ones and the S4's run a wide range from low $12k up to $30k for some
'90-'91's....clearly those at this top price will never sell for that.  Even
very low mileage ones won't go there.  I saw a White w/ Green Cloth (go
figure...the woman did not want leather so  the story goes) 3K miles for $25k
at a dealership in San Antonio.  Others have spoken of even better deals of
about $12-15k for cars w/ less than 20k miles.

I do not see the prices of the S4 and new cars slowing much in their
decline...I think they will fall into the low teens over the course of this
next year...really opening up the 928 market to many more people.  One thing
to remember though is that if you look at a very nice well cared for car w/
full service records and an owner that showed great amounts of tender loving
care it would probably be worth more than one that just sat for the last few
years w/o being touched.

Hope that helps a little anyway...just my $.02 worth.
