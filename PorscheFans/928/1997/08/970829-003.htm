The magic blower will not go off no matter what switches I adjust.  And it
does only happen when it is in the off position and the fan knob is set to
0.  Come to think of it, it has only happened during the summer months.
One thing I will say is all of your explanations have given me wonderful
ammunition to volley at friends who have experienced this phenomenon and
said I should have purchased a "reliable car".

What does this microswitch do?
