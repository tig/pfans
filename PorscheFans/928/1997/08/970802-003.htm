        When I first started storing cars it was costing a fortune to heat a
garage over the winter.  So I ran a simple experiment, I took a bare piece
of sheet metal and placed it in the garage for one winter when it was heated
at 21 deg. celcius.  And then the same thing another year only with a
dehumidifier this time.  After the fact it plates showed signifigantly less,
as in harly no corrosion on the plate that was dehumidified, where as the
heated plate was definitly coroded.  It also cost about 1/4 of the heater to
opperate the dehumidifier.  One startling thing I found was that about every
other day the machine would remove 2 litres of water from the two car
garage! Although it is best to have both going, but isn't really nessasary.
In a two car garage that's insualted it should stay about 10 deg. celcius,
atleast on the coast of BC Canada, due to the heat generated by the
compressor in the unit, however it is relativly safe to let it go below
zero, as long a the leather doesn't mind.
        As for the rest of the car,  it is a good idea to jack it up and get
the weight off the springs and tires, as well as stop moisture from creaping
up the tyres onto the undercarage.  Fuel preservation additives, they do
work, but a good tank of gas about 1/2, NOT FULL, NOT less than 1/8, can sit
for about 2 years as well. But if it has gone bad and the car won't fire
than top up the tank with some new stuff when you go to start it.  AC
systems, well, the only know preservation I know of is to start the car
every month, 2 or more in the winter months, and run the AC.  This keeps the
seals good.  As well it is a good idea to run the engine about every 2
months, doesn't have to drive, just run.  As well on a 928, having lots of
moving parts, it is a good idea to run the car once a month anyways and make
shure every thing still can move.  Catching freezes in components in the
early stages can be perswaded, rather than having it replaced later.
        Although if your not mechanically inclined and just like to see the
928 in the garage, then the most improtant things to do is to...

        A: Disconect the battery
        
        B: Get the car off the wheels

        C: Attempt to run the car every month

Thoes can keep virtually any car in good shape for about, 2-6 years without
hitting the road.  Any longer than that you may require some maintenance
done to be in good shape again.  As well don't forget to change your fluids
even if they were new when the car was parked!

Experience teaches all lessons!
