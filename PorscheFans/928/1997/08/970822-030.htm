Hi. After searching for over 2 years, I paid a San Diego owner $30K a few
months ago for a creampuff white '90 928S4 with 30K miles. The car was
absolutely flawless. The owner was a perfectionist who kept the car garaged
and in showroom condition. I paid top dollar because the car was worth top
dollar.

Like the forces which drive any market, I believe the traditional laws of
supply and demand will act to stabilize future 928 used car prices. 

928s are no longer being manufactured, so the supply side of this equation
has become extinguished. Yet because of the 928's unique streamlined design
and its incredible performance, the demand side will continue and will maybe
even grow. Accordingly, IMHO, 928s will become a collector's item. As a
collector's item, the value of a 928  should increase in direct proportion
to it's condition. Mileage, while always a criteria, will become less
important. A 928 in prime condition, should last at least 500,000 miles. I
believe that notwithstanding the added relative personal value that comes
with pride of ownership, 928s if properly taken care of, as opposed to most
car purchases, will prove to be a great investment.

Hope that helps a little anyway...just my $.02 worth.
