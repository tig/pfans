What the heck....I'm gonna add to the thread here..........

The comments thus far sure make sense, and I wish we all wind up totally
flabbergasted with rocket -ship-like values for our beloved 928.   Truth
is, car values and investers are fickle.  If you talk to a DeLorean
owner (and look at ads), they are worth "well over $20k.......people
just don't know the REAL value of this fantastic car!"   Of course, they
routinely sell in the low teens.  I own a couple of AMC muscle cars that
fit the formula for high investment return (high performance, rarity,
original manufacturer long dead, etc.), but reality is that they have
always and likely always will be valued considerably below other more
'desirable' makes.

The reason I bought my 928 is the same reason for most of my automotive
purchases - I love the car!  Heck, I taped the 928 sequences of Risky
Business just to see and hear what for me is a very seductive
combination of automotive creativity.   There is NOTHING like the aft
end of a 928 in production cars - which is what most other drivers on
the road see!   :-)

I haven't been here on the list for long, but it appears to me that the
vast majority of you feel the same way.  If the values simply follow
inflation and never skyrocket - I'll still be very happy.   For the
record - I'm rebuilding a 928 that most sane people would have used as a
racer or for parts.  I'm doing it because it appeals to me to 'bring
back' a basket case and creating a fine example of the original car.
The net effect will also be to create excitement in anyone that sees and
hears it - hopefully contributing to the overall value of 928s
(admittadly in a small way).

Again.......I hope our cars go through the roof in value.......but I'll
love the darned things just as they are today!
