Hello Pfans!
Grounded the beast friday night to find out once and for all what the
squeaking was coming from, and I've got good and bad news.
Most of the noise was a pilot bearing trying to seize.
The bushing on the throw out arm is missing, but the wear did not hurt
the walls of the cup, I should be able to put in a new nylon insert with
no problems.
The "ball" on the bell housing is shaped like an egg, replace for sure.
The throw out bearing is junk, as well as the guide tube.. is it
supposed to taper? :)
Both clutch disks look worn, but not baked, and the flywheel and
pressure plate look ok, but there is quite a bit of wear on the inside
of the "fingers".  :(
The center disc has evidence of some really hot times in it's past,
(oval blued spots) and I am not sure what to do with it..
The manual states to buff/roughen the metal parts and reinstall them,
any comments?
Has anyone ground the center disc or do we believe that would throw off
measurements?
And lastly:  Someone was posting some REALLY cheap prices for clutch
parts, could you send me a line on where you got them? Thanks!
Obviously I am replacing: Discs, t/o, guide tube, pilot bearing, release
arm ball + bushing..
Thinking about replacing: Pressure Plate, center plate, entire release
arm, center plate.

To do everything approaches $1000 in parts alone, so if anyone has real
info on what parts can be re used acceptably, I would welcome advice!

Thanks All!!
Ken Hartley
'80 Euro-fied and grounded :(

(guess all that newfound HP killed the clutch)
