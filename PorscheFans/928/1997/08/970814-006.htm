It really does depend on how much you want to do, what tyres you want to use
(sizes) and how YOU feel the car handles. I have mine setup very agrressively
i.e. outside Porsche specs. Generally add more negative camber, especially on
the end that breaks first when all of the car is at the limit [not just
accelerating/breaking hard]. decrease toe in /add toe out depending how fast
you want the car to react, but the more you add the "twitchier" it will behave
on Utah streets ;-) I have mine at 0Deg.

BTW are you coming to any AX events? Wendover maybe? There is usually a great
course, up to third gear in parts. It would be nice to see another 928 running
again.
