If it's a manual you have BEEG problems!  Ok, just joking.

Early shifting in the A/T cars has been partially attributed to low
fluid level.  How's your a/t level?

see above.  It should be holding alot longer than that if under full
throttle.

Maybe they fragged the kickdown switch or connections?  It's under the
gas pedal...  Does your trans kickdown at all or just chug along in the
same gear?

Also, from what you've described, your mechanics seem to be evading the
service issues.  My '84 has the same 4-speed a/t as your '83, and I can
say when I floor it the car responds immediately, kicking down if within
range ie. the kickdown at 90 is especially entertaining.

Welcome to the list,
Phil
