928 Fans,

	I must admit, I wasn't surprised to find out that this list
existed.  It's always the other 928 drivers that are the first to
wave as you drive by, and it's nice to know there's a place to
ask questions about the toy.

I have two problems that I'm trying to resolve now.....

I'm having a problem with engine noise within my radio.  The car
has a Pioneer single disk head unit and an ADS 35 watt amplifier
under the hatch release cover next to the passenger seat.  These
are the symptoms:

	- RPM dependant noise only within the rear channel which runs
	  through the ADS amp.  There is no noise through the front
	  channels which are powered by the head unit.

	- No noise when the engine is not running.

I am using the original radio and amplifier power and ground leads.
When viewed with an oscilloscope, there seems to be a considerable
amount of noise on both the switched power lead and the battery lead
from the fuse box. 

I have tried grounding the head unit and amplifier and installing just
about every in-line filter imaginable.  Still no luck......  Did
something change with age in my fuse box, or was the origninal sound
system exceptional at filtering noise?



Secondly, (and maybe related to my first problem....) I'm getting a
"whining" electrical noise from my instrument cluseter.  The noise
(which almost sounds like a weird buzzer) comes and goes as it pleases.
As with my amplifier noise problem, this noise is also RPM dependant.
At times I can give the gas pedal a quick tap and the whining will
go away,,,,,  for a while.....  Could this be a bad relay, or possibly
my tach on its way out???



Thanks in advance....
