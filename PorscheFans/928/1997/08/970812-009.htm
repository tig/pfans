I replaced the thooted belt on my 85 and it is not an operation
for the faint of heart.  There is a lot of stuff to take off to get
to the belt which account for the 11 hours of time required to 
do the job.  Also, you NEED to have the special belt tensioner tool.

You need to remember that a t-belt failiure will results in very
expen$ive damages.  However, if you are mechanically inclined, have
a lot of patiente and some degree of insanity (like myself) it is
doable.  If you are still interested, I will write up a procedure
and add it to the FAQ (like I was suppose to a long time ago).

PS, if you change the timing belt, you should also change the
water pump and thermostat while you are in there.  Also, you need to 
be very familiar with a torque wrench as it is very easy to strip
threads
on engine with a certain milage.

PPS. How much mileage does your car have?  Is it possible that your belt
only need retensioning (should be done every 15,000 miles or so)?
