What about the ZR-1's?  Don't get me wrong; I really like 928's as much
as anyone else on this list, but I know the recent-model ZR-1's have
quite a bit of HP, if I'm not mistaken.  The ZR-1 engine is (I think)
closer in construction (overhead camshaft, 32 valves) to the 928 engine
than to the "standard" Chevrolet 350 motor (pushrod).

Just curious.
