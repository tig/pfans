Looking at the '85 diagram, the fuel pump relay also provides power to 
the
following:

Auxilary air valve
Auxilary Fuel Pump (fitted to Japanese & Australian versions only)
All 8 fuel injectors
The Oxygen Sensor.

So if your Fuel Pump Relay isn't going, you're not going to go 
_anywhere_!
From this, I'd be more inclined to call it a "Fuel System" relay!

On a seperate note, I say an advert listed in the Porsche advert system
where a Canadian guy was after a right hand drive 928. Two questions:

1. Why on earth would he want one?

2. Would there by _any_ RHD 928's in North America?

OK. Make that 3 questions...

3. If there were, surely they'd be worth less than a LHD one?

Thanks for the reply.

Ever wondered why Porsche jumped from the series 2 to series 4? Its 
because we got the series 3.

Our 85 does not have an auxiliary air valve as far as I know. It does 
have an automatic idle speed compensator which does precisely what it 
sounds like it should. It feeds air past the throttle valve to keep the 
idle speed constant. I think this feature found its way to the rest of 
the universe with the S4.

Your Questions

1. Why would a Canadian guy want a right hand drive? The only reason I 
can think of is that he/ she wants to take it to another country with the 
UK being the most likely destination. Canada is home to folks from all 
over the world including England. I'm originally from the UK myself. 
Perhaps someone is going back. I've been here since 1975 so I think I'll 
stay. We could be talking about an avid racer I suppose. Around a 
clockwise track the weight of the driver on the right side of a car as 
heavy as the 928 would probably reduce lap times by a nano second or 2.

2. RHD in North America? Very unlikely unless someone bought one over 
from the UK for example. I've seen a few RHD Rolls Royce's, old MG's, and 
Jags but that's more logical expectation.

3. If one ever turned up I'm sure your correct unless someone is turned 
on by blind passing maneuvers or driving backwards everywhere.
