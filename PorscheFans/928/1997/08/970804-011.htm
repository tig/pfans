This thread is getting very technical...  Here is my $0.03 worth (I am a
chem eng, so its worth
a liitle more than usual).

Rust is caused mostly by MOIST AIR.  to that extent, this is why a
dehummidifyer works beter than
heating a garage.  Also, the colder the air is, the less moisture it
contains.  This is why a
cooler garage will make a car rust less then a warm one.  By putting A/C
in a garage, it will
tend to dehumidify the air (just look at the AC unit dripping water...).

The worse situation with a heated garage is during winter driving in the
snow.  You get
the car full of snow and salt (already not an ideal situation, the salt
contain chloride
which is very corrosive to most metal) and then you put the car in a
heated garage.  All the
snow melts and create a lot of water stagnant on the body of the car and
a very moist 
atmosphere.  The life of the car is greatly dimminished by this
process.  However, I do not
think that you will be driving your 928 in the snow.

As vor the coccoon, you could fill it with Nitrogen but it would need to
be dry.  I am not sure
that it would be worth the effort as it is hard to evacuate all the
oxygen present.  If your 
coccoun would fill from the top, you could use argon to backfill the
cocooun.  Because it is
heavier then air, it would displace the oxygen easier.  The problem with
backfilling the 
coccounn with an "inert" gas is that if you have a leak in the cocoun
and try to backfill it, you
could flood your garage with the gas and reduce its oxygen content below
the point where you
are able to breathe.  at this point, you are in big trouble so be
careful.

IMHO, the ideal storage would be
	1. Dark
	2. Temperature control (say 70 F)
	3. Moisture control (say 40% RH)

This would be fairly easy to maintain, would not be too expansive, would
let you work around
the car and would prevent corrosion without drying up the leather.  The
car should be started
every month and it would reach operating temperature (idealy while
driving it) and the car A/C
would be turned on for at least 10 minutes to prevent the seals from
drying up.

>

Sure, water has oxygen in it, the O in H2O, and I suppose, but am not sure, it is that O that combines with the iron, FE, to make FEO, (or is it FEO2 or what?), AKA rust. But  air, too, has oxygen, so why doesn't iron rust in hot dry air? I took chemistry as part of my engineering degree, but I have forgotten why dry iron doesn't rust. Anyone?

I think I read years ago that you can't get a tan much in a glass greenhouse because the glass blocks maybe 98% of the UV, whereas in a plastic greeenhouse you can get a tan or melanoma. I suppose my paint feels the same way about UV. You think?
