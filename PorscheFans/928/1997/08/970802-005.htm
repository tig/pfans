	Didn't this already happen? I thought I read an article
	somewhere about the residents of a Chicago tenement house
	suing the Housing Authority in Federal Court over the
	Authority's use of cameras in the hallways and stairwells
	of certain "high-risk" housing projects. If I remember 
	correctly, the court ruled in favor of the Housing 
	Authority...
