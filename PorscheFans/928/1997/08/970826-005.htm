Sterling,

Therein lies some of your problems , there is supposed to be a "scupper valve"
there. Maybe someone has ripped it out.
Believe me every 928  has the cowl area drain "scupper valve", I have
disassembled almost all years (79,81,84,86,89,90,91)and they are always there
and usually clogged. I suggest you get one and pop it in before you have even
more problems. With out the valve in place the air pressure from inside the
engine is going to blow more junk inside the cowl area and keep it from draining
properly.
