<<one suggestion about an emboidered shirt. It's a nice idea, but it would

be expensive to do and the shop I go to would want big $$$$ for

that. >>

It wont be as much as you think.  The major cost is in the shirt.  If you do
polo shirts, obviously they are more than t shirts.  Embroidery, once the
machine is set, is not much per shirt.  Shop around first.  I think I would
also suggest that one person take the lead on organizing the shirts, then
collect individual responses.  

I have had shirts made each year for a family thing I do with my brother and
father, and my brother has had hats embroidered each year for the last two
years.  It hasn't been that much.
