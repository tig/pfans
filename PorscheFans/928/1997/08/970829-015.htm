On the newsgroup 2 days ago someone posted a question as to the pros 
and cons of 928s. Two posted back the next day - I was one - to watch 
out for this. Both of us quoted $6000 to fix. But he was looking at a 
later model. Did we misinform him? If so, I'd like to post a 
correction. After I thought about it, I realized I am guilty of 
passing on mere heresay as if I had direct knowledge of it. The old 
ego, you know.

I recalled that on this list several days ago, one post said he 
thought maybe it's only models '80 or earlier that when the timing 
belt breaks the pistons hit the valves.

Can anyone pin down which models are in danger?

If you asked a dealer, would you trust the answer? Has anyone 
authoritative ever put out a bulletin or article on it?

I am going to post this message on the newsgroup too.

Will
