Better that "one" reason is downforce.  Remember that the original 928 had
earned a bad rap as not being particularly slippery (it seems every econobox
manufacturer trumpeted their speedbrakes as "more aerodynamic than a
Porsche!" based on the 928's cD).  Total aero drag is less about entry shape
(the point of a wedge) than the factors of separation of airflow from the
surface, turbulence and, most importantly (excuse my lack of the correct
technical terms here), the reintegration of the airflow following the car.

The original "S" spoiler at front cut the amount of air flowing under the car
(especially over speed bumps!).  At the rear -- since the air coming out the
rear from under the car creates a powerful negative pressure, creating drag
by: a) separating the smooth undercar airflow, b) pulling airflow down from
the rear hatch creating more drag -- the spoiler both redirects overcar
airflow and also helps isolate this air from the undercar "vaccum."  Judging
from Porsche's published cD figures, "S" vs. original, this didn't amount to
much of an improvement.

With a typical "fastback" shape like the 928, the biggest overcar airflow
hangup is where the roof begins to fall away.  On the 928 this is at the top
of the rear hatch.  Look at the huge, high-mounted airfoil on Ford's
Euro-only Escort-Cosworth rally car for an extreme example of how this issue
is addressed in a "performance uber alles" scenario.  One other issue on
production cars is the way the airflow around the passenger greenhouse
integrates with this overcar turbulence to create a swirling mess of drag.
 That's why most cars (vide the 911 Turbo's whale-tail) do not follow Ford's
radical solution... there are a lot of  different issues that can be
addressed with a spoiler mounted somewhat lower, and there also aero
advantages to moving this aero crutch further back (which is why most racing
regulations limit the distance of the rear wing from the rear axle
centerline).

OK, so far the rear spoiler issue -- whether the "S" spoiler or S4-&-later
wings -- seems more related to drag than downforce.  As LL noted, top end is
more an issue in Germany than our ET-obsessed culture.  Porsche's obsession
with this is perhaps shown by their fanatical work on the S4... automatic
radiator intake flap, under-engine belly pan, the careful reshaping of the
inside and bottom of the rear bumper cap, etc.

There is, I think, a second influence at work here, i.e., sales.  When
American Peter Schutz became Porsche CEO (ca. 1983? 84?) the marketplace had
made it clear that the 928 was NOT the 911 replacement Porsche had hoped.
 (An aside: H.L. Menken wrote, "Nobody ever went broke underestimating the
taste of the American public.")  Soft leather, big wings, etc. were marketing
strategies directed at the "Miami Vice" wannabe crowd.  Note that, at about
this same time, a Mercedes director was fired for publicly stating that (I
paraphrase) "We're in big trouble as soon as people realize that we're
charging double for cars made the same way and from the same material as
everyone else."

Given these three factors -- drag, downforce & boulevard flash -- I think
downforce is the least important issue in how Porsche sized and placed the
S4's rear wing.  Nonetheless, I agree with Leonard, the best bet for placing
an aftermarket rear wing is to duplicate the S4 wing position (and to remove
the "S" spoiler if you've got one).
