<<Is a battery tender different from a battery charger?  I'm buying the

Porsche battery that David Roberts is parting out so I'll probably get a

battery tender to keep it up if I can figure out what one is.>>


It is different.  And forgive me if your question was already answered.  I'm
trying to catch up today.  The tender will have a circuit that monitors the
voltage and only sporadically charges as needed.  I have the same problems
you describe.  Not so much this summer, but over the winter my battery will
discharge. 

I jump by hooking up a 10 amp feed to the underhood power post, let sit for
about five minutes, and then crank the engine with the charger still
attached.  

To prevent the discharge problem this winter I will be making my own tender.
 You can buy one for about $30-$40 dollars, or you can make the equivalent.  

I will use a AC to DC transformer putting out about 1amp. I will add a
cigarette lighter socket (available at radio shack) with about 16 guage leads
soldered to the socket and bolted to the battery.  This socket will sit in
the trunk behind the tool panel.  When the car gets put up I will plug in a
male lighter plug attached to the transformer.  I will probably just attach
the transformer to the garage wall near the plug, then add enough cable to
the leads to reach the trunk of the car. Then the AC plug on the transformer
will be plugged into a household timer.  The timer will be set to supply
current intermittently.  This will prevent overcharging, while keeping the
battery topped off.  You will have to experiment with the length of charge
allowed by the timer.  I will probably start with about two hours a day.  1
amp is so low that there should be no risk of boiling the electrolyte.  

I will be setting up the same thing with panel mount jacks for the motorcycle
and the jet skis as well.  

Good luck, or just buy the tender and set up a quick disconnect system so it
is easy to plug in in a hurry.
