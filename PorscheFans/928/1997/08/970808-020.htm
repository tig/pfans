<<This might sound stupid but up to a day ago, I was sure that my 85 had

no alarm

system.  At this point, I have some doubt:

1. Someone mentioned that all model starting in 84 had one (so I assume

no code on the

    back sticker).

2. The new master key ordered through PCNA using my serial number came

back saying

    with alarm and unlocked all the locks except the driver's door

(figures).

3. The drivers sided tumbler has a big switch at the back of it...



Now, if someone tells me where the module is, I can put an end to my

quest (and get an

insurrance discount...this even if the car sits in the garage all the

time...)>>

Alarm module is behind the glove box in a slot bracket against the fire wall.
 It can be slid out of the bracke, and lifted out with cables still plugged
in.  It is a usefull point to make some connections when installing an
aftermarket alarm.  I will be writing up a procedure, with as many clear pics
as I have, to post on the FAQ when I get the time, and all the pics developed.
  I am going to start with the polishing procedure, and I think Phil is going
to work on it with me.  Alarm next.  The switch on the back of the lock
tumbler is a micro switch that is activated by the extra long key.
