I accidentally deleted the chemical engineer's post.

From human memory:

At first it seemed obvious that too-low humidity would dry out leather =
and that would harm it. Then I wondered, is it water that keeps leather =
pliable, or oil? And if oil is enough alone, would it evaporate in  low =
humidity? If not, why not go lower than 40% relative humidity?

You said 40% would prevent rust/corrosion. Is it that there is a threshol=
d % below which rusting/corrosion stops?

I will probably put two cars in cocoons, and wonder if I shouldn't take =
the % down as low as possible. I am thinking about that airplane storage =
lot in the desert, and the Dead Sea Scrolls.
