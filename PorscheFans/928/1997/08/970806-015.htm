"I'm not sure what injection system a USA '85 has, but I used to have an
intermittent starting problem with my '83 Euro 928S. Invariably it would
refuse to start _only_ when there was a family nearby  with a kid saying
"look Daddy, a Porsche".

My Porsche mechanic told me it was most likely to be a dicky fuel pump
relay, so whenever it happened, Sally-Ann would have to pull her legs up
onto her seat and I'd be down in the passenger foot well jiggling relays,
usually to no avail..............................."

Thanks for the response. My car is a Canadian spec but as near as I can 
tell its identical to the US model. Its quite different to to the 
European and ROW version as it has the 32 valve engine and the LH 
Jetronic fuel injection system which is very different to the K Jetronic 
on your 83. We lucked out and got this engine a couple of years early, 
the so called S3. The LH system does not have separate cold start valves 
and injectors. It changes the duration of the injection based on 
temperature measurements instead. Your message has given me another idea 
however. Perhaps I do have a fuel pump problem as you suggest. Most fuel 
injected cars with electric fuel pumps that I've come across seem to run 
the pump for a couple of seconds when the ignition is first turned on. 
This is to prime the system presumably. This is certainly the case with 
my 914 for example. My 928 does not do this. I had assumed it was looking 
for oil pressure before the pump kicked in. Perhaps my assumption was a 
poor one. If I am in fact correct, I would assume the system should hold 
fuel pressure over night at least. Perhaps I have a leak down problem. 
This sounds like an interesting possibility. Does anyone have any 
thoughts? Can anyone out there with an 85 or 86 (I suspect the S4 would 
be similar also) tell me if their pump runs when the ignition is first 
turned on?

Thanks

Colin
