I had a friend named Moira, but that was a long time ago in a far away
place (ever lived in Chile?). 

>For anyone who is curious about prices, I looked at a '89 S4 w/45,000
>mile, auto and not in the greatest condition...asking $25,900.

I bought a near perfect '89 S4/5 Speed with ~68K for $24K, original
owner had all records, meticulously maintained, etc.

>I'm back even though no one has answered my questions!

I am fairly new to the list, but had many responses...  Do not know what
to tell you

>I really want a GT and it has to be a '89 or newer. Am I dreaming???

I am not sure there were GT's before 89, but I do know that availability is
an issue.  Because of that, the price of a good one will be higher.

here is a good place to check for 928 availability:
