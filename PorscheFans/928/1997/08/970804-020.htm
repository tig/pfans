Alrighty,  I can get a special dispensation to use company time JUST
THIS ONCE (/) 
Here goes:

928 Black leather Interior: (from Pano June '97)
"The blakc leather oin your 928S is surface dyed.  It will wear down to
the natural tan of the leather.  Surflex by Color Plus makes a good dye
in black that I helped them develop {the author, John Patarek} It has
the same satin finish as the original Porsche surface.  Call
201/635-5918 for more information on this dye.
	The preparation is to have a clean dry leather surface, and since the
dye is a water based polymer, it bonds to the surface with little
abrasion to the leather surface required.  You can use 0000 steel wool
to prepare the surface and then apply the dye with a small piece of
cotton towelling the size of a golf ball.  You should wear a disposable
glove or you will permanently dye your fingertips.  You can treat the
dyed surface after it has dried (6-8 hr drying time) with Surflex
leather care, another product made by Color Plus..."

Hope this helps.


I was planning on buying the dye and leather care from these people, but
haven't gotten around to it yet.
