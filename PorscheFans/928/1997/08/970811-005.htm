Actually, there were a few spots of chipped paint, but the spots 
remaining are definately not chipped.  They look like they could be 
water spots or somthing like that.  In fact a few of them are round 
with a little 'tail' coming back as though there was some liquid on 
it and it dripped.  Did the 1984 black finish have a clear coat?  I 
can't tell, but it doesn't look like it to me.
