Doug, I have found that most  tire alignment shops do not know how to do =
a proper front end alignment on 928's   The first clue is inside tire =
wear,  the second is the car tends to wonder on roads that are only =
slightly rutted, and third, the steering is stiffer.    The worst job =
ever on my 928S was done by a Porsche dealer.  After they finished, I =
had an alignment error of 1 degree per tire, or 2 degrees total.     I =
now check my alignment, (toe and camber) every 5,000 miles and make any =
adjustments necessary.   With a simple home made tool, I can check my =
alignment in less time then it takes me to gas up.    I have also found =
that with a little practice, an accuracy of about 0.05 degrees total is =
easily obtained.       If during the alignment process, a tire is =
suspended (lifted off the ground) the suspension MUST be re-settled.  If =
I suspend my 86 front tires off the ground for 5 minutes and then set =
the car back on the ground, the toe in is 1 degree on each tire.  (2 =
degrees total)  Bouncing the car will not re-settle the suspension.  The =
method outlined in the factory must be followed or abort the alignment.  =
 A 3 or 4 mile drive MAY settle it.  My 86S takes 8 to 10 miles to reach =
norm.   If one is very fussy  on tire alignment, they will do it with =
the tank  over half full and an appropriate weight in the drives seat.   =
My last set of P7 only lasted 35,000 miles.  They  would have lasted =
longer except for the excessive wear caused by the poor alignment done =
by a Porsche Dealer.   I am a firm believer in constant fine turning of =
the front end alignment of my 928.   It is either that or own a tire =
shop (and it handles better).   =20

I am leaving town for a few weeks but when I return, I will write up my =
procedures and send a copy along with a diagram of the tool to Phil for =
posting to anyone interested. =20
