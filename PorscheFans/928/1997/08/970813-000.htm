I got the impression that the dual coil/distributor set-up was peculiar to
the '84/85 Euro 928S2.

I've just grabbed the brochure for the 1984 928. Here are some comparisons
I can think of off the top of my head.

My '83 Euro 928s         '84 928 Standard (Euro?)     '84 928 Catalytic (N.Am?)
4664cc                   4664cc                       4957cc
16v                      16v                          32v
???                      310hp                        288hp
k-jetronic               lh-jetronic                  lh-jetronic
single dist              twin dist (shown in a photo) ????
no ABS                   ABS                          ABS
3 speed Auto             4 speed Auto                 4 speed Auto

My '83 S is ex Hong Kong, which would have got the same models as the UK
market ie RHD Euro.

I'm not sure what the "NZ new" market got, probably the same. From the
service manuals it appears as though Australia got something entirely
different from anywhere else, maybe a RHD version of the N. Amer. models?

Can anyone in Aussie help out here?
