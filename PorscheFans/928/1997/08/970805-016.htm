Derron,

To touch up the leather go down to your local shoe repair shop and get some
acetone (take a little jar and they will give some to you) and some shoe dye
to match the color of your interior.  Rub a little of the acetone on the
spot, it doesn't take much, just to dry out any oils then apply the dye.
Once dry finish it off with a little good quality leather oil and maybe a
touch of 303 or something of the like for moisture and conditioning.  That's
it.  Should look great and is very easy.
