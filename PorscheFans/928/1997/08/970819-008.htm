Throw a bottle of Red Line WaterWetter in it.  In addition to lowering
your
coolant temp by 10-15 degrees, it adds some decent water pump lubricant
and corrosion inhibitors.

It'll cost you about $8 US.

For a dealer near you, call Red Line at 1-800-624-7958.  If you're not
in the U.S.
(I saw that Celsius temp!), drop me a note and tell me where you are,
and I'll
call them for you.
