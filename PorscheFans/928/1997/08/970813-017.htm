I was on that list.  Still no 928, though...

There was a '93 GTS in the Washington Post a few weeks ago for $25k...  I
get the feeling I should have robbed a bank and bought it.  ;^D

***warning; much newbie content, most likely already beaten to death***

Seriously, though, here's a bunch of questions for the list, with the aim
of determining the big differences zwischen the S4 and the GTS.  (I'm
looking for the full luxo route, so want an auto).
* I know the GTS got the 5.4l engine, but as I'd be going for the Devek 6l
upgrade eventually, I'd prefer not to dump a bunch of money into a
larger-displacement engine right now if I don't need to.  However, the '95
Devek catalog cites problems with the oil sump design of pre-GTS engines
(oil starvation in hard cornering).  Does Devek (or anyone else) have a
cure for this yet?  I like hard cornering...
* For what year was the the trip computer added?
* LSD became standard for '90, I believe?  Was it available as an option
earlier?
* Did the changed single-disc clutch work right when it was introduced with
the S4 in '87, or is better to get a car a year or two newer?  Is it
actually any better, esp. in high-hp applications?  Can you retrofit a
double-disc unit to a later car?
* Any (major) body changes after '87?  (If not, how can you tell S4/GT/GTS
apart, without seeing a rear model designation?)
* &c.

I was going to go search the list archives, only to find that the search
function has yet to be implemented...  And my book
(_Illustrated_Porsche_Buyer's_Guide_) only covers up through '90.  I've
been working on the assumption that I want an '87+ for the improved
aerodynamics; I definitely want a 32v engine and ABS.  ABS became standard
in '86, but was it available in '85 as an option?

I love the original 928 styling, but a few weeks ago I passed (the 928's
driver obviously wasn't in a rush) a white '87+ 928 on I-95, somewhere near
I-495 (I'm talking metro Washington DC area here), and it was a beautiful
sight to behold--I've become much more comfortable with the new styling.  I
don't suppose this car belongs to someone from the list?

I'm thinking that I'm going to *have* to get a 928 sometime soon, if only
for the A/C...  In Idaho, an open window made it comfortable even in he
peak of summer heat, but it gets *hot* out here in Virginia (something I
knew, having lived in the South before, but I was never in a position where
I had to wear ridiculous business attire and do a lot of driving)

And here I am looking at a new job that might land me even further south,
down in Raleigh...

Anyone know a friendly bank that makes loans for 6-10 -year-old supercars?
