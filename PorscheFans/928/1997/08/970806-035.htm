Hi Andrew:

This project could be a lesson in frustration.  I would suspect wiring
and contacts to be the culprit but the only to be sure is to remove your
console and have at it.  I wasn't that brave, instead trying the knob
bulbs first.  Wanting to be thorough, I changed all the bulbs. Funny,
the ones that burnt out liked new bulbs.  The ones that worked before,
didn't now  :- |      Matter of fact, the tripmeter bulb would pop out
everytime I pushed the switch back in the dash  :-(    Worse yet, the
darn lights were just as dim with the new bulbs as with the old :-#

I didn't gain or lose any ground, the bulbs were cheap, but I wouldn't
spend anymore time in the console if I didn't absolutely have to.

Forget about doing white gauge faces too, the potential for problems is
just too much even if you send the console out (plus no way to readjust
settings conveniently).

Wait for a bit to see what the other members experiences have been, they
may have more luck with this procedure.

Phil
