It is possible that you might be barking up the wrong tree.  I would
verify that you are getting the proper fuel pressure when you turn the
ignition key on but NOT cranking the engine.  If you do, then start the
engine and let it run for awhile.  The fuel pressure should vary with
the engine speed.  When RPM goes up, pressure should go up as well.
Turn the engine off.  Note the fuel pressure at this point.  Let the
engine cool down.  Note the fuel pressure again.  It should not change
for an extended period of time.  If so, then you have a leaking check
valve or injector(s), which means that the engine do not have enough
residual fuel pressure for the next starting cycle.  Other things to
check for: fuel accumulator and pressure regulator.

Folks, a fuel pressure gauge is an invaluable tool to have when you're
dealing with any fuel injection system.  Go buy one!
