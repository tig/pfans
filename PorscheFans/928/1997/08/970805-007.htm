 I'm looking forward to watching you and your 928 race I've never seen a 928
racing so it'll be cool to see.   My 928 goes in the shop today so I'll let
you know the extent of the damage as I hear it.

I'm still looking for a 993 (not sure) replica wheel to replace the one I
broke in the crash it's a 9Jx17H2  dfxT 602
ET47 NP  made by Mini Miglia
Does anyone know where I can find one???
