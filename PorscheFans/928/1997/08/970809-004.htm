 This may be a little verbose, but it's my first posting here, and after 3
months of reading, it seems appropriate to provide some background.  
 My new (12 year old) toy is a 1985 928S, 5 speed, Black with some
performance upgrades.  These include AutoThority chip, Borla exhaust, and
suspension upgrades.  Needless to say, the car is a lot of fun to drive.  
 This is actually my 4th Porsche.  My first 3 were 914s.  I loved the 914,
but in the Northeast, they don't seem to last.  The last one rotted away
about 5 years ago.  Thanks to the folks at Automobile Atlanta for helping me
to keep them going as long as they did.  
 During my 914 years, the 928 was introduced.  I always felt that this was
the one that Porsche did right, and that someday I would own one.  
 The car I bought was a little 'rough around the edges', but ran great and
seemed to be very strong and came from a known source.  There was 57,000
miles on the odometer.  My mechanic spent 2 hours and couldn't find anything
to be concerned about.  I am quite a tinkerer and fixer upper so I felt I
could bring it back to full life.  Things like: the stereo system that the PO
was so proud of but the left front side was not even working (totally
miswired), courtesy lights with a mind of their own, broken fog light lens,
climate (no control) system, minor body dings, etc.  I've managed to
straighten out most of these items and now the car is even more fun to drive.
 
 And now for my obligatory technical question.  Sorry to take advantage of
all you nice folks my first time here, but I'll try to make this an easy one.
 My Porsche doesn't pee.  Wait, I'm serious.  The condensation discharge from
the air conditioner is backing up and creating quite a stench in the vehicle.
 Most cars have a hose that drains water when the AC is running.  I have had
to clear this hose on other cars, but I can't seem to find the damn thing on
this one.  Can anyone lead me to the drain?  
 Thanks in advance for any help on this one.

'85 928S Black 5 speed with civil modifications.
'86 Audi Coupe, Black, Limited Edition (Digital dash, power windows, leather,
etc.).  All original except suspension upgrades.  Great fun.  
'88 Jeep Wrangler, a great Northeast vehicle.  I've had this one since birth.
 
'91 Taurus LX wagon, Black, with all the toys.  The wife's around town
workhorse and a nice cruiser for when there's more than 2 persons.  
'85 Honda Shadow 700cc, Black.  More fun.  

Has anyone noticed the number of Jeep vehicles owned by 928 owners?
