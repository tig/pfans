Hello,

This past June I aquired my first Porsche, a 928. First I'd like to thank
Phil for putting it's picture on his web site (1980- Keith Robinson). I
suspect this car was a stolen / recovery or just maybe the most abused
Porsche on the planet. Although the body is in good shape, the interior is
destroyed and it has numerous electrical problems. It appears that the PO
had some sort of monster sound system that was not professionally installed.
There's splices all over the place. Pigtail splices, Western Union splices,
3 into 1 and so forth. I plan on attacking the electrical problems first
and, as you can see, I have my work cut out for me.

After waiting patiently for the workshop manuals to come off back order, I
finally received them this Friday. I can not seem to find any procedures for
removing the dash board. I believe removing the dash board would make the
job a lot easier. Is there anybody out there that can tell me how to do
this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Keith
