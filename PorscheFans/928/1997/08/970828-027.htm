Congradulation on your your purchase and sorry about the trouble.  I had
some
problem with my key but it involved the alarm system.  The fact that you
have change
the key and still have the same problem leads me to believe the keys
were not the source
of your problem.

Does the key activate all the instrument but just does not let you start
the car?
What is the voltage reading on your instrument panel?  If your voltage
is low
(Bad battery, bad ground connection, corroded starter wire), the car
is design not to start.  This would be my first guess.

I am sending your request on the 928 Porschefans list so that more
people get
a chance to diagnose your problem.  I would strongly recommend that you
try to join the list to exchange your experience with the one of others
(http://www.porschefans.com)

As for the list member reading this, please answer Phredd directly until

he his a member of our growing family.
