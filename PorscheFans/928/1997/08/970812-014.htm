     My previous 928, an '86 S / Auto, had a similar problem.  The dealer
     diagnosed it as a dirty/faulty sensor on the drive shaft.  According 
     to them, there was a magnetic sensor that sensed rotation somewhere
     under the car.  They did not want to replace it, since my speedo would
     start as soon as speed got higher (25-30 mph) and getting to it would 
     be expensive.

     As I am still having my speedometer problems, does anyone know how to
     get to this sensor on an '82?  Has anyone replaced it already and have 
     an idea about cost and the amount of time spend under the car?
     
     Thanks,
