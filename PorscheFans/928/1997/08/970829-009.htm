Hi all,
This is just a question out of pure curiosity more than anything else
(I have an '88 911 Targa), but I've always liked the looks of the 928.

A friend of mine said last night that he was considering buying a 928
with an AMERICAN (Chevy?) V8 engine.  He wasn't clear on displacement,
tranny, etc, because he hasn't actually seen the car yet.

Is this a common thing to do?  What kind of Detroit Iron engine drops
into which kind of 928?  Does the transmission have to be changed, or
does it bolt right to the Porsche trans? (It's in back, right?)  Do
you get any benefit out of this other that the engine being cheaper
and possibly newer? What cost would be associated with this
up(down)grade, and would it unbalance the car?

This probably sounds like ruining a car to more than a few of the 928
owners out there, but it seemed interesting enough to ask about.

Any comments/discussions/rants and raves appreciated,
Colin O'Keefe
