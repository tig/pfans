The cold start injector is controlled by a temp sensor.  If the engine
is dead cold, this sensor will provide continuity to the cold start
injector.  The significance of turning the key to the ON position
WITHOUT cranking is to check the building up of the fuel pressure and/or
priming of the fuel pump.  Based on my experience, if your pump hum
loudly when first turned on, it generally means that you do not have
residual pressure on the fuel lines; hence hard starting.  Another
important reason to have residual pressure is to eliminate vapor-lock.
This will show up as hard starting on a HOT engine.

The fuel accumulator is another potential source of problem.  Its
purpose in life is to "accumulate" fuel for high fuel demand situation;
eg. cold starting and full throttle condition.  The fuel regulator is
used to regulate the fuel pressure in proportion to engine vacumn; eg.
you don't want high pressure when idling.

About the fuel pressure gauge.  Purchase a reasonably good quality one.
You can find them for about $40-60.  The professional one runs around a
few hundred.  The important thing to look for is that it has a relief
valve with a separate run-off hose connected to it.  This is used to
relieve fuel pressure when you disconnect the gauge from the fuel rail.
You do not want gasoline spilling all over the hot exhaust manifold... a
BAD situation to be in.  Also get the one that comes with various
fittings; especially for Schraeder valve of different sizes. (important
if you own more than one manufacturer of vehicles..)  My final
recommendation:  If you don't have a fire extinguisher in your garage,
GET ONE!
