The best way to diagnose a starting problem with a fuel-injected car is
to perform pressure testing according to the sequence indicated in the
Bosch manual using the special pressure guage settup. This should tell
exactly what the problem is.  I paid a hour's labor to have my system
tested, and saved myself buying a new fuel pump.

If you are collecting guesses, let me add one.  My PO had described a
"starting wierdness" which he called "lazy fuel pump syndrom".  The car
would never start in the first 20 seconds of cranking. It always started
immediately on the second try.  Problem turned out to be the check valve
(located next to the fuel pump & pn 893.906.093).  It is inexpensive,
and, if you have never changed it and the filter (pn 928.110.253.00)
those parts are relatively inexpensive and fairly easy to change.  The
fuel pump was not "lazy" at all and continues to work fine. 1983 cars
also had a fuel cooler.  It is remotely possible that the cooler might
be allowing contamination into the fuel.
