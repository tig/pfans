No.

Chevy SB & BB into any 928.

Chevy block bolts to chevy bellhousing. Chevy bellhousing bolts to adapter
tube. Adapter tube bolts to torque tube. Utilizes original Porsche transaxle.

Right.

Ever see a Porsche 928 motor powering the worlds fastest cars? Nope. Ever
see a Chevy engine powering the fastest cars? Most of them are GM (like Chevy).
Remember, friends...I'm talking about drag racing here. Ever see
a Porsche 928 engine win the Daytona 500? Nope. How 'bout a Chevy? Yep. Hmmm...
this trend repeats itself over and over. How much is a cam for a Chevy? About
$150. How much is a cam for a Porsche? $1800? How easy is it to change? These
are mostly questions which need no answer! Not only is the motor cheaper,
after-market and OEM parts are available everywhere for less. Granted, a
Chevy SB will never make the 100,000 mile mark (let alone the 200,000 mark
that a 928 engine has no trouble reaching), BUT a rebuild on a Chevy is
about $400 in parts!

Well...buy a 928 with a blown engine to start with. It's under $2000 for the
conversion kit (that's a kit with everything needed to make the swap _but_ the
motor). Buy a Chevy engine for anywhere from $1500 to $7500, depending on what
kind of preformance you desire. $1500 gets you ~250 HP. $7500 gets you ~700HP.
How much money does it take to buy a 928 engine? How much build it up to hit,
say, 450HP?  A Devek stroker kit is about $7500. This stroker kit _doesn't_
include a 928 engine! It's about $5000 to start with _nothing_, buy a Chevy 
motor and build it up reach that 450 HP mark.

As far as any unbalancing, the Chevy SB weighs 10 lbs less. Remember, we're
dealing with one cam, not DOHC. Use aluminum heads and the weight drops farther.
Use an aluminum intake and the weight drops farther. So...there's possibly a
20 or 30 lb difference. Minimal. I think you'll see no effect on balance.

I bought a running, 1979 928 that needed cosmetic help (faded paint, tattered
interior) for $2000. Then I dumped $5500 into a SB Chevy engine (and a bunch of
other nifties like a BIG aluminum radiator) to get about 450 HP and 500 ft/lbs
of torque. I'm having the car painted right now. I'm almost done with the
project (PorsChevy)  and I'm $11,000 into it. But remember, it'll do 0 - 60 in
about 4 seconds! Quarter mile times will be in the low 12's! Best of all...it
looks and handles like a 928! And for a measily 4 or 500 more bucks, I can add
NO2 and see over 600 HP...no problem.

What does your friend want? I want to go out and CrUsH everybody! New Vettes,
Vipers, NSXs, 300Zs, IROCs, Mustangs, RX7s. And I want them to _think_ it was 
a stock 928. Hee hee!

BTW - I own another, non-bastardized 928 and it's staying totally stock and I
love it.

PS -- I've put about 200 hours into this conversion as I did it by myself.
