        I got some feed back on my post about maintaining the power and
keeping the better in good shape while storing a 928.  I'd like to say that
buying a "battery tender" or any other type of battery cycler is usually a
waste of money.  I've found that just a simple trickle charger is JUST fine.
I've run a trickle charger on the Studebakers for up to 2 years (personally)
and being able to jump in it and drive away, electrically.  There are thoes
smart chargers out there that could cost between $120-$600, but experience
has shown me that the "smart" circuits in them are not very reliable.  Some
will actually shut down if some thing causes a spike or voltage drops accros
the battery whitch may be just a bad connection or some device in the car.
As well the oler chargers will take over current loads better, and not tend
to fail after a few jolts like the smart type.  I'm still convinced that
just a simple charger with NO control devices in them, only a switch to
control, trickle, charge, and starting is all that one needs.  I'm not
saying that the new chargers are no good, but if making a GOOD buy is in
your nature than this is the way to go.  Although if you want nothin but
first class for your car then go ahead and buy the smart chargers, but
you'll have difficulties and a shorter charger life.

Experience is my basis.
