PFans,

Need you help.  I have an '88S4 w/ the silver colored clear coated...not
anodyzed (SP?) wheels and I messed up the finish on one of my rears.  It is
not terrible, and most people would probably not worry about it, but since I
like the Concours event stuff (as well as the track stuff) I need it fixed.

Any ideas on what to do to make it that silvery blue kind of color and then
to clear coat it?

Can I do these things myself?

Where in or near Austin, TX could I get the work done?

Don't tell me R. Wood or Wheel Enhancements...they would love to exchange me
a whole set for $700 or a single for $200...yea right...I can wait on that.
 If I wanted to spend that kind of money I would just invest in some new 17"
for the track.

Does anyone have a nice rear w/ that color/finish sitting around that they
would do an exchange w/ me on for less than $200?

TIA,
James Morrison
