Yup, I think you're talking about cars other than the 928 - it's that
thing I said above and, offline, Jim said that was the way he figured
out that his '83 works too so I don't think yours should be different
than my S4.  So, let me recap my first post, the thermostat seems to act
as a mixing valve.  When the engine is cold, the waterpump circulates
water through the engine.  When it's hot, the thermostat opens fully and
blocks the route through the engine so that coolant only flows through
the radiator.  When in between, the thermostat lets some through the
radiator and recirculates some through the engine.

So it's not at all clear to me that removing the thermostat will
increase the coolant flow through the radiator - it is clear it will
increase the coolant flow but I'm guessing most will go only through the
engine and it therefore may actually decrease the flow through the
radiator.

Evidently, very few of us have been in there.  My dealer parts guy said
the 944's are known for having bad thermostats but not the 928's.  Of
course, there's not a whole lot of data.  Anyone know of any really
non-obvious reasons why a 928 overheats?  (My other car, a 525, uses a
plastic waterpump impeller.  These have been known to loosen with age so
that the car will overheat at speed on the highway but then have the
temp drop when idling in traffic.  Very confounding at first - the
impeller slips at high RPM but not at low.  The 5'er hasn't done it
yet.)
