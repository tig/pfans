<<I'm running Mobil 1 too.  Nice and clear vs. the brown syrupy Castrol

the best things we can do to help preserve our power/drivetrains is
keeping fresh fluids in it.>>

I changed over mostly because I was doing very short trips, and the oil
mostly never got a chance to warm up.  The disadvantage of living in a small
town.  If the oil doesn't warm up, it doesn't get a chance to burn the acids
off.  These acids are bad for the engine.  So by the time I get to stretch
the service interval a little, and KMART had the sale for $18.60 a case on
M1, I thought I really ought to do it.  

<<So when was the last time you changed your trans & diff fluid?  I think
I'll accelerate my schedule while I track the car just to keep an eye
out for shavings, etc.  Maybe do a change quarterly.  Since I'll be
doing the subsequent servicing (first change was part of my purchase
agreement with Lucky & free) I'll have to rent a lift at a local gas
station or something.  Easy job though, especially with those cool new
squeeze bottles!>>

I had the at filter and fluid changed right after I bought the car, as cheap
insurance.  I will change it again at about 25 to 30 K if I keep the car that
long.  I have never changed the diff fluid though, when is it time, and what
does it take, and how hard is it?  I had the at fluid and filter changed for
about $30 including the ATF, I supplied the filter.  I was warned that it was
generally messy and difficult in the driveway.  

I will make a general observation for others.  Be very carefull about
overfilling the oil.  I have had that happen twice when I let others fill it
for me.  This has caused a slight leak in the valve cover gasket on the pass
side above 115 MPH.  Obviously not a huge problem, and it hasn't been
accelerated by the switch to small molecule oil.  If it leaks, I degrease top
and bottom, and no problems till the next sustained high speed run.  I am
interested in doing the valve cover gaskets though, does anybody have any
info on cost, difficulty, and tricks?
