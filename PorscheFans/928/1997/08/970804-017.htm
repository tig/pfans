928 Fans,

 Time to set the record straight about the test mules (cars) used for the
development of the 928.

1972
Test Mule V1 - Mercedes 350SL used for chassis testing in 72 ,latter fitted with
928 carburetor engine.

Test Mule V2 - Opel Admiral used for basic suspension testing, later fitted with
steerable rear suspension and second steering wheel for rear wheel steering.

Test Mule -"Munga" bare chassis structure for inital engine testing.

1973
Test Mule V3- Audio 100 Coupe used for engine and transaxle testing in September
on the open road.

Test Mule V4 = Another Audio Coupe with the whole body widened by 4.3 " (928
engine doubled perf. of Audi)

Prototypes
K1 - Marginally Drivable with Yellow Plastic bodywork, was later used as first
crash test 928



W1 -  First drivable Prototype with steel bodywork

etc. ,etc.

All above info from the Offical Porsche sponsored "PROJECT 928" book.
