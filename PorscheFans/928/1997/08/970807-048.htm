Yah - I wouldn't want to do the AT or converter either.  The diff &
tranny are no brainers too, provided you can get the plugs off that is.
You know, basically there is a drain plug and a fill plug on top of
that.  A large breaker bar is helpful!   I've already heard of one plug
that froze and is rounded  and don't know if they've been able to get it
off yet.   I suggested crazy gluing the socket on and replacing with a
new one.  Hope they got that far!

There's been some commotion over the difficulty of filling due to the
filler location and people of suggested everything from using a long,
long tube to hold up, to air pressure assist, to small hand / electric
pumps (yeah another power tool!).  I'm going to use a Mityvac.  Jeez now
I now why I wanted some of that plasti-dip - the plastic handles are a
pain after a few minutes of squeezing.
