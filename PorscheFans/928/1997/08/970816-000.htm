When I tried to finance my 928 I figured a machine like this could become
quite expensive over time: repairs, maintenance, registration, insurance,...
- we all know it. I would not want to worry about both this AND car payments.

So I decided to wait until I could actually afford to pay cash for the kind
of 928 I wanted. I kept my old, beat up car and saved money in the bank. Then
I purchased the 928, and saved on the colission insurance. Yes, you're
reading right: Since I do own the car I can take the risk myself, and save
half of the insurance cost. 

I figure that even if I total one car in my life time (I don't plan on this,
though) it'll still be way cheaper than paying colission insurance over all
those years (plus, in Wes and Jack's situation: interest).

I also don't put my money into fancy customization, because all this money
would be lost if I ever decided to sell my car. For me, a 928 is the
greatest, most beautiful car ever made. What more would I want?

I know it's a conservative approach, but it got me a beautiful car that noone
(other than thieves who know how to defeat the alarm and the club) can take
away from me.

Just some food for thought...
