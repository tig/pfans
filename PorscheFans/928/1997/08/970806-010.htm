Thanks.

Yes, paint is good. But underneath, with a driver, there are chipped plac=
es, springs and other exposed steel. Which all will be able to see under =
my cars on storage lifts.

I had a car detailed yesterday and for $20 they also painted all the whee=
l wells flat black. Looks neat too.

What do you know about refreshing undercoating?

The membership chairman of our Louisville, Ky P club was a member of the =
board of the Louisville Car Museum, permanantly closed a month or two ago=
 for lack of support. ;-(. I will ask him about museum quality preservati=
on next time I speak to him, and get back to you. However, I suspect that=
 you have to watch out you don't keep a museum too dry for the patron's =
membranes. Not so with a cocoon.

Please see also my posts today re cocoons, and related garage fires.
