Hello fellow 928 owners!!

If you live in Texas or any ajoining state and are interested in 
driving your 928 at high speeds on a closed track this message is for 
you!!

                 WHO: Lonestar Region (Houston) PCA sponsors this 
event.

                 WHAT: High-Speed Driver's Education Event

                 WHEN: September 27 and 28 1997

                 WHERE: Texas World Speedway, six miles south of 
College Station, Texas on Highway 6.

                 WHY: To experience your 928's true driving potential,
 meet other 928 owners, and have 
                           a great time!!

                 COST: $150.00 per driver. This gets you four 20 
minute sessions each day on a 1.8 mile                             
circuit with 12 turns.

                 REGISTRATION: Contact Sybil Margaritis at 281-359-
6351 if you are interested. Registration                              
              opens on 18 August for Porsche Club members and 2 
September for                                           non-members. 
Registration priority is given to Porsche Club members, then          
                                 Porsche drivers. A large volume of 
entrants are expected so get your                                     
                application in early!!

                 GENERAL COMMENTS: As of 12 August I know of three 
928s that will be running at TWS in                                   
                  September. James Morrison (88 S4), Judy Rosten 
(86S) and myself.                                                     
   James and I plan to bring photos and video from previous runs at 
                                                    TWS and of his 
concours victory at the Porsche Parade in June. If                    
                                 you do not want to drive the track 
and just want to check things out                                     
                 come on out!!! There are opportunities to work at 
several of the                                                        
    corners and see how this whole event is run. That's how I got my  
                                                        start.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding this 
event. Sybil Margaritis will send you an application that covers all 
of the details etc.

Hope to see a few new 928s at the track in a few weeks!!
