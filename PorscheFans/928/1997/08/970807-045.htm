Looking at the electrical diagrams, there are three temp sensors for
most models from '78 thru at least '88, they are used for various
purposes depending on year/fuel delivery system/emissions.   However,
here are the basics:

    1.    The temp switch facing forward on the thermostat housing
(brown electrical plug) is for the cold start circuit.  It's responsible
for energizing the cold start valve at the front of the intake manifold
to charge the intake with additional fuel, increasing revs until
warmup.   At that time, this switch de-energizes the solenoid which in
turn shuts off the additional fuel to the intake manifold plenum.  The
cold start valve is the one with the wire connection and black hose
routed to it's side.  This switch is designed to provide current to the
cold start valve until the water temp is approximately 104F after which
the resistance is high enough to de-energize the coil inside the valve.
You will know if all is working well if startup produces higher revs,
then dropping to 'normal' after a few minutes.  This is the temperature
THERMO TIME switch.

2.  The   TEMPERATURE  SENSOR aka TEMPERATURE SENSOR II is located
vertically off of the thermostat housing and has a gray plug.  It 's
purpose in later models is for the computer.   It is parallell with the
A/C temp switch, either which can cause the radiator fan to operate.

3.    The temperature sensor (sender) is just behind TEMP SENSOR II, has
the two separate connectors, and provides the varying signal to the temp
guage.

4.  The temp switch located at the bottom of the radiator is a true
switch that operates the radiator fan anytime the coolant temp is above
the set point of that switch.

Hope this helped.
