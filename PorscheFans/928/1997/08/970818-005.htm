 I've always used a small circular disk grinding wheel to completely
"buff" out all mating surfaces on the the plates.  You can get the
equivalent disk for mounting in a drill from any chain parts store (I
think they come in three-packs with three different coarseness').  When
you're done, all the the surfaces should have bright swirls with no blue
patches.  Don't worry about upsetting the balance as you're taking off
an insignificant amount of material. I've done this every time I've had
to service a clutch, or swap an engine.  Works really well--I always got
hard 3rd gear chirps, even with stock(ish) Euro engines.

 Me thinks $1000 in parts is too high.  The last two clutch packages I
purchased was from Vertex (Page 77, August Pano.)) for $389 (2 disks,
pressure plate, T/O bearing).  The rest of the items you need could be
sourced from 928 Int'l, like the pilot bearing, nylon insert, the
sleeve, ball-joint.  The last two items I got used from them.  (Also,
note that there are atleast *three* different sizes of ball-joints used
at various times.)  You should be able to "get away" with less than $500
total cost in parts.

Clutch package: $389 + $30 S/H
Sleeve:         $ 20 
Nylon insert:   $ 10
Ball-joint      $ 10
Pilot bearing:  $ 10 + $15 S/H
-------------------------------
                $474

Note: These figures are from memory, but should be within 10%.  928
Int'l might be able to match the $389 from Vertex.

 My BIGGEST complaint is clutch re-installation.  It is never easy,
mostly because of the "unwieldyness."  That is, weight + sharp corners +
TIGHT fit in bell-housing + alignment. My trick is to use a jack
(against the starter ring teeth) to hold everthing up during alignment
of the dowel-pins (if yours is the dowel pin type). You'll cuss at it a
few times, but eventually everything will line up...
 (Once I could not find my bearing puller, so I used my cutting torch to
remove the pilot bearing. No points for style...but it worked.)
