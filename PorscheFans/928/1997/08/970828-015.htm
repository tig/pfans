Aha! A Frequently Asked Question!

Your clutch is operated hydraulically. The pedal operates a master
cylinder, which pressurizes brake fluid (drawn from the same reservoir as
used by your brakes), which then operates a slave cylinder, which moves the
clutch plate.

When you're car's hot, you're not getting complete disengagement of the
clutch. This is due to bubbles (typically steam, but can also be the brake
fluid itself) in the lines due to boiling of trapped water or brake fluid.
When you step on the pedal, you're compressing this gas, which does nothing
to disengage the clutch, and can't even push back effectively on the pedal.

This is the same phenomenon as brake fade and has the same primary cause:
old brake fluid which has absorbed a lot of water.

Meanwhile, you may also have leaks in either cylinder or in the lines
connecting them. Check these first, then drain and refill your brake fluid
reservoir. We're all hep to checking our timing belts, and pretty sure we
should change our engine oil frequently, but we should also be changing our
brake fluid frequently and using high-boiling-point juice.
