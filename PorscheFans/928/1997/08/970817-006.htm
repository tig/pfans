Anyone dropping by DEVEK to see the Euro should call ahead.  This makes 
it much less problematic for all.  Be sure to talk with Marc or Susan, 
as they know all about the car.

Also, if anyone was put off the car by the thought of redoing the 
interior (time- & sun-worn but all there), DEVEK has on-hand a COMPLETE 
interior for an early 928 that is in excellent condition.

I want to thank Marc and Susan for allowing me to park my car there and 
for dealing with the phone calls and people dropping by (including me), 
all on their own time.  They've gone above and beyond on this.
A great shop and even better people.

Doug K
