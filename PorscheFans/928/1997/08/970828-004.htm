Someone (sorry, I forget who) pointed out that the resistor pack
which controls the fan speed has thermostatic protection; when
the pack gets hot, the thermostat shorts across all the resistors,
which causes the fan to run at full speed, producing airflow across
the resistor pack, which then cools down so that the thermostat
opens up and the fan returns to normal speed. The whole process
takes five to ten seconds. Also, the most power is dissipated in
the resistors when the fan is running at its lowest speed; that's
the only time it ever happens to my car, I finally realized.

So far, so good. However, that doesn't explain how the fan can run
with the slider in the off position, which someone has seen. Not
a clue on that one. Might explain Leonard's correlation, if the
timing isn't too exact. Does explain what I've seen, without the
need to invoke mystical forces or demons.
