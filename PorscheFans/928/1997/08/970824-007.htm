<<Brian's a broker and I'm sure he will find cars for you!>>

Yes I am!  And I have been locating 87-89 928's for a couple of other people
and have quite a few in my locating files.  I even have one in Cincinatti.
 Give me a call to discuss more about what you are lookingh for.  Look
forward to talking with you.

Relative values, my 928 as an investment, how much is my car really
worth?  These questions floating around on the list have made me think
about why I own my car and my experiences with my MGB.  I have a 76 MGB
that I have owned for years and a 79 928 that I bought this spring for a
little over $7K. I don't have as large of an investment in my 928 as
many of you do so I'm sure that's why I'm not as concerned about
recouping my money.  I bought my 928, not as an investment, but because
I have admired and wanted the car since I saw my first one in 78.  It is
an incredible vehicle, especially when compared to the other cars that
were being built in the late 70s.

So, what does this have to do with MGBs?  Well, MGBs have not enjoyed a
high resale/return on investment either.  B owners have come to accept
this and instead of worrying about it, spend their time enjoying their
cars.  They restore their cars (knowing they will never get their
investment back) and then drive, show, and generally enjoy their cars.
They have car clubs, shows  and a true loyalty to their marquee.  The
essential  part of the equation, and the one that I feel we 928 owners
must never forget is that there are a few dedicated companies that
support these cars.  Moss Motors, British Victoria and others supply
parts and support to MG owners.  These companies, especially Moss Motors
even manufacture parts that are no longer available from Rover.   Can
you imagine having to park your 928 forever because you could not get a
new timing belt or some such part.  This is my concern.  Every 928 that
bites the dust means one less customer for the after market suppliers
and the likelihood that I won't be able to buy parts to maintain my
beautiful car.  I am excited about this list and the little geographic
groups that are forming around  enthusiasm for the 928.  The after
market suppliers see that kind of loyalty to the car and are encouraged
to invest in providing support to our 928s.

Back to value;  While  MGB owners were busy enjoying their cars and
ignoring the question of how much their cars were actually worth, the
cars have actually started to creep up in value.  I think this will
eventually happen with the 928s.  I don't think anyone who paid $80k for
their 928 will ever get that out of it.  The prices will eventually stop
dropping and then edge quietly back up,  Will I get my $7k back on my
79?  At this time I wouldn't even think of selling it for that.  It's to
much fun, to classy, to pretty, and so on and so on.

Finally, I don't think the general public has any idea how cheap these
cars actually are.  I could easily tell my coworkers that I had to pay
$25k for my car and I know they would believe me.  Regardless of what
the air-cooled crowd thinks, the 928 is still a Porsche (and an
incredible one).  People just don't realize that these cars are
available.for such a small investment.  I put off buying mine because I
knew I couldn't afford it.  I never checked, I just knew. Finally, one
day I picked up a Hemmings Motor News and was absolutely shocked when I
saw the prices early 928s were bringing.  I immediately started my
search and have never looked back.  These cars need to be put into the
hands of enthusiasts who will maintain them and drive them, not
transformed into Spyders or parted out!

Thanks for listening,
Chris Trask
