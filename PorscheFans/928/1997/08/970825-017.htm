The tricky part of dash removal is removing the instrument cluster/pod.  
The six switch-knobs in the pod pull right off.  The switches can be
carefully levered forward by squeezing the 'ears' together with a couple
of small screwdrivers and pulled through the front of the pod without
removing the pod and then the switches themselves are pulled off their
plugs.  Replace any of the small switch illumination lights that are
bad. I mention this, because when you go to reassemble the cluster/pod,
you must pull the switch plugs and cable bundles through the front of
the cluster cover (pod), install instrument cluster, cover, align
steering column, then plug in the switches and push into the holes in
the pod.  You will never be able to plug the plugs from the rear.

You will want to pull seats, stearing wheel, pod, knee shelves, golvebox
door and liner, front roof piller post trim & center console before
pulling the dash.  The good news -- you don't have to remove the
windshield as on a 911.  The dash is only held by a few bolts (four, I
seem to remember) but you will need to get the other stuff out of the
way for access.

It is not difficult work, just tedious.  The best advise I received was
to proceed slowly, mark and label everything.  If you tug on something,
and it doesn't move freely, look around for a hidden bolt.  E.G. there
is a bolt inside the glovebox  on the left side.  Another bolt is behind
the a/c vent (lever out with putty knife) in the center console.  Look
in the manuals about removal of instrument cluster and a/c blower.  You
don't have to actually remove the blower, just the other stuff.

Second best bit of advise was to get a 1/4" drive swivel bar.  This is
not just a universal socket, but a bar with 1/4" head that swivels
through a 180 degree arc.  

You may need to replace the three 5mm socket-head bolts that position
the steering column.  I stripped two of mine in removal, but replaced
them with grade eight metric bolts - not socket-head. 

Good luck!
