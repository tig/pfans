 I have the same problem with my 83 (5-speed) exept for a few things.
For instance my 928 only gives me trouble with cold starts,  I can hear the
fuel pump go into hi mode when I crank it the first time then low mode the
second and third time,  etc... until it stumbles to life,  then it some
times stalls once.  I figured my problem as bad plugs but haven't really
diagnosed this since the crash,  I can give you a few pointers that I recall
reading out of the user manual;  take the car out of gear and step on the
clutch,  some times just pressing the clutch won't cut it.
Good luck.
