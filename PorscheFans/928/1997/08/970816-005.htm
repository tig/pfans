Hello all-
A favor to ask everyone... whenever anyone posts a message such as this I
would very much appreciate it if you guys could refer the person to me.  As
most of you know I own my own business doing auto locating and brokering, and
I specialize in Porsche and Mercedes-Benz.  I would love to assist anyone on
this list in locating the Porsche of their dreams... I just need some help
getting the word out!
Thanks a bunch.
