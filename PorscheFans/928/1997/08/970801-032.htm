Alright, alright!!  If you have no desire to read about wheels and tires
and wires, fast forward here!!

The Turbo replicas are on hold, not for sale to anybody, pending an
agreement between Porsche and FRH.  I think FRH made too good a
copy....(smell that lawsuit brewing)
So I am thinking about going with 18" diameter Chromodora wheels.
Formerly known as the CD770, and now called "Sin", they are available in
18x8.5 and 18x10.  Painted with 234/40-18 ZR fronts and 295/35-18 ZR
rear tires, I can get the whole package, mounted and balanced, and
delivered for $2056.  Pretty tempting.. Here is where the guru info is
needed:  My manual states that my 15" phonedials have a 65mm positive
offset front and rear and are 8" wide (discount tire actually said that
about the width). Soooo, these "Sins" use a 46mm positive offset on the
fronts (8.5"), and a 47mm positive offset on the rears (10")  My
estimating puts the rears all the way out to the wheel lip, and possibly
interfering, depending on how much "bulge" those 295/35's have in the
sidewall.  My estimating places the front rim outboard 1.5" from
stock.With such a low profile front tire, and the terribly stiff
Weltmeister springs, they might not hit either.  But this is why I am
posting!!  Does anyone know if the Weltmeister 428in/lb springs, (I
believe we call them the Early ones) fade and get lower, and if they do
can it be compensated for with the adjustable lower perches?  Secondly,
the wheel fitment guide for the 10" wide "Sin" wheel for REAR use states
"928 S4 only!"  Flame away, but does the S4 have flared lips on the rear
arches?  It was my (mis)understanding that we all share the same metal
body parts, all years.  If that is true, and since my car REALLY needs
paint, can a body shop roll my arches out like the S4? Would it be
better to give up entirely on the 10" width for the rear, and go
same-size all four corners?

Thanks to all who gave commentary on the Plug wire mini-issue!!  I did
spring for the Nologys, but the kicker was Engine Builders Supply, who
told me "We ran a 1982 16v 928 on the dyno, stopped it, swapped wires,
and ran it again.  They got 3% power increase at 2K and varied results
between 3% to 5% throughout the rpm range.  He said, "Basically draw a
power curve just slightly over the stock curve, and that is the results
we got." So, like Tom Cruise in our favorite movie (gold, just like
mine!) I said "What the ___" and bought em. It's only money.. I regret
that I cannot give the group a "seat of the pants" driving impression of
this power gain claim, because of all the other stuff I modified
simultaneously.  And there is always the possibility that I was lied to
in order to get the wires off their shelf! (they were in stock)  As far
as fit and finish goes, they are pretty good.  In order to do their
Capacitor magic each wire needs a minimum length, therefore to get to
holes 5 and 6, those wires have to take a detour around the intake tubes
and snap on the plugs from the other direction, this might bother some
of the purists in the group, but since my old gal is far from pure, I
did not really care!

Wow, I should have typers cramp by now!

Thanks for your patience!
