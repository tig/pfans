  Kim crumb did an article on 928s in the July or August issue of 
  Panorama.  In the article, he stated that only the very early
  models will freewheel if a belt breaks.  All others will have
  valve to piston collisions.  I believe the early models were '77-'80,
  but I can double check this an repost on Tuesday if no one has given
  a definitive answer by then.
  
  At the very least, I know my '83 would bend valves if the T-belt broke.
