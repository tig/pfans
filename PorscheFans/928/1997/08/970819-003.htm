I, too, used the cheap 5.9% credit card rate for the initial purchase of my
'86 928 S this last January, and I intended to play the "keep rolling over to
new introductory rates" scheme as each card's deal expired.  The time frame
for this is pretty screwy, though.  It usually takes about 30 days for a new
card to come "on line" and about 30 more days for the balance transfer to
"take."  This turns a six month introductory offer into just four months.
 Also, you'll generally need at least two cards because, no matter how
exemplary your credit rating, these intro offers generally don't offer limits
beyond about $5k-$7.5k to start.  With over $10k due, just one month of
"oops!" at, say, 13%, can wreck even the most carefully planned scheme.

So I went shopping for a used car loan to get out of the frantic
card-swap-hop.  No commercial bank wanted to touch a car over 10 years old,
no matter the brand or book value.  One credit union would only finance 80%
of "wholesale book" at 10.0%.  This worked out to only 70% of my purchase
price.  A second credit union got my business in June '97 with the following
deal:

     -- 8.03% for 48 months
     -- Financed full amount with zero "down"
        & no documentation of my claimed purchase price
     -- No prepayment penalty at any time
     -- $30 processing fee

The disadvantage, of course, is that I now have a lein on my title.  But
don't worry, Leonard, I'm not REALLY planning on selling the beast anytime
soon!
