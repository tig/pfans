A safe bet, especially when keeping in mind all the stripped threads
others have suffered while innocently draining the block etc.

I'm running Mobil 1 too.  Nice and clear vs. the brown syrupy Castrol
synthetic (tastes great, less filling!).  I'm convinced now that one of
the best things we can do to help preserve our power/drivetrains is
keeping fresh fluids in it.

So when was the last time you changed your trans & diff fluid?  I think
I'll accelerate my schedule while I track the car just to keep an eye
out for shavings, etc.  Maybe do a change quarterly.  Since I'll be
doing the subsequent servicing (first change was part of my purchase
agreement with Lucky & free) I'll have to rent a lift at a local gas
station or something.  Easy job though, especially with those cool new
squeeze bottles!
