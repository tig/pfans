Kenneth Hartley asked:

>> Leonard, (or anyone w/GTS wheels and tires)
Would you, at your leisure, _this is NOT urgent_, make a measurement of
your rear wheel height (or circumference if the mood strikes you) with
the 255's you are running.  I am beginning to suspect speedometer
inaccuracy and I might just have "toodarnsmall" tires on the rear
(225/50-15).  <<

I just went through the wheel/tire upgrade on another car and learned a
little....

No GTS wheel is needed to check this out....

The 225/50-15 is about 23.9" tall and does about 868 revs/mile.

To calculate the height of any tire using the above example:

1. 225 is the width in mm.  Divide by 25.4 to convert to inches (2.54cm
in an inch).  Width is 8.86"

2. 50 is the aspect ratio.  (i.e. sidewall height is 50% of tire width)
Sidewall height is 4.43"  Total height is two sidewalls + wheel
diameter.

3. 15 is wheel diameter in inches. Thus, the total height is
2(4.43)+15=23.86"

Using the same formula a 255/40x17 is 25.03" high.  (829 revs/mile).

So, the mileage difference is about 5%.  

BTW, according to my factory sales brochure, the standard 928 tire was
215/60VR15 which would be 25.16" tall (824 revs/mile).  Seems to me the
255/40x17 would be a possible substitute involving little difference in
overall height.  Another good substitute would be a 225/50x16 (25" tall
& 829 revs/mile).  That is what Yokohama suggests. Or maybe 235/50ZR16
(25.2" 829 revs/mile) but these may be hard to find.

BTW2, heights will vary slightly depending on the width of wheel used. 
The 255/40x17 can fit on rims 8.5-10.0" wide, the 215s 6.0-7.5, the 225s
6.0-8.0. 
 
BTW3, you will find that the 17" rims are a lot more expensive than 16"
rims.  Take a look on the Tire Rack website:  www.tirerack.com
