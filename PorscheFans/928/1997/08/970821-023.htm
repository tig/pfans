Great choices!  I think you will be hard pressed to find a GT though,
the ones I've seen lately are in the mid-30's.  Automatic 928s don't
seem to have much of a resale market so there's where the tremendous
bargains are.  You should be able to find a really nice S4 stick or
manual in your price range though...  Go lower in price and the miles &
problems might start appearing.

Newest?  Maybe up to an '88 - again, I really doubt there are any $25k
GTs now.Lowest miles?  Maybe mid 20s - 30s?  You just have to keep
looking and be patient.

I used to think this also but during Summer there's the pressure from
all the other cars on the market so you just might end up paying more
during Winter!?

How about this, you find a nice '85 - '86 32 valver for mid-teens.  Do
an S4 body conversion using Matt's parts for sale, sell/trade the S rims
for 17's that you really want, add the latest tires of course, maybe a
hot chip or headers and voila - S4 look & power but with some upgrades &
cash left over for stereo stuff :)

Heh heh, see I'm playing devil's adovocate here to test your resolve...

As LL advised me, fight the good fight and hang in there,
Phil
ps.  Brian's a broker and I'm sure he will find cars for you!
