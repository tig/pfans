Hi all!!
Would someone post a source for this Super Ving?  I cannot get very much
info from Strosek's web page.  I guess I was a couple of seconds late in
swooping on Alan's bargain!

The clutch is in and clutching fine. True to earlier posts, the worst
part was holding the whole thing together while you put it up in place.
(Ok, >grunt<, it's perfectly lined up....but I need yet another hand to
start a bolt!!) The slave cylinder was a little grumpy for a bit and
would not completely disengage, but after a  few minutes and much
pumping and it got with the program again!  Thanks to all who had
advice!! It was much help!!
Oh, I almost forgot.  If you have headers, you need to loosen all the
nuts that hold them to the heads by 3-4 turns to allow the collectors to
swing out of the way!  For a minute I was horrified, thinking they would
have to come completely off to access the cover!

To LL: You are running a set of Technology wheels.  Wheel enhancements
tells me the Dyno will only fit '90 and newer cars to have the proper
offset and that design will not work on an '80.  This limits me to the
Technology type. What year exactly should I order them for so I fill the
wells and need no spacers?  Once again I am getting confused........
Thanks for your time! (Very beautiful car you got there!!, fantastic
shots!)

Sorry for the non-directional rambling, I just got down from a canyon
drive. I must be a bit giddy still. :^}

Thanks!
Ken Hartley
