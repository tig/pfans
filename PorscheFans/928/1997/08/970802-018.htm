Not limited to the 928, the general caution with large diameter wheels, at
least when paired with tires whose overall diameter is about the same as
stock, is that the resulting very short sidewalls expose your rims to curbs
and relatively uncushioned whacks from potholes. Be sure you're ready to
take the extra car required to avoid bending and breaking those sinful new
rims.

No matter what wheel offset you use, and without the additional
complication of lowering the car, you're unlikely to get anything wider
than 275 mm to fit inside the rear wheel wells without significant
bodywork. I have GTS-spec wheels and tires all around on my car (no
spacers), and there's not very much clearance left with the 255-section
rears. Devek sells trick wheels which will carry 275s without interference
at front and rear.

Not on the outside, but the wheel house inside may be roomier than on
earlier cars, given that the S4 was the first 928 model with wider (by 20
mm) rear tires.

No. Particularly if you've gotten some extra power out of your engine, it's
useful to have wider wheels and tires at the rear. Just keep the dimensions
under control. If you must run 18" rims, go ahead and use the 10" width but
"paint" it with a more moderate tire (e.g., 265/35x17, a size you can get
in Michelin Pilot SX MXX3 or Bridgestone S-02, two of the very best tires
available).

You will be startled at the improvement wrought by an arrangement like
this, or even a 17" GTS-spec setup (in which "Technology"-style wheels are
available if you want something snappier looking than the stock "C2" style;
check Wheel Enhancements at http://www.wheelenhancement.com/). Top-grade
modern tires with short sidewalls are enormously crisper and stickier than
anything available when your car was built.
