Hi Ken,
 I am EXTREMELY abusive to my 928s (racing, etc).  This has happened 3
times to me. And each time it was a ceased/partially-ceased T/O
bearing.  If you continue to drive it, it will get worse (with moments
of no symptoms) and then eventually grind through the pressure plate
"fingers" causing your clutch to parmanently remain engaged.
 It's not that difficult to repair yourself, just a bit time-consuming. 
I think I've dropped the double-disk clutch package about 10-12 times
over the last 6 years.  I'm down to 2-evenings work for it (4-5 hours). 
The first time I think it took double this.  In any event, you might
want to get a complete clutch package from Vertex.  I think they still
have the best price (around $400).

Marc
