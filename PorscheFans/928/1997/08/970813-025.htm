I am new to the list - and to the 928.  I used to have a (eeeek!) 924.  Not
even close to the same car!

I have a few questions for the "experts."  A WILD GUESS is a good response
- I appreciate all responses - (StevePeck@viperlink.net) I have a 1983 928S
Automatic

CRUISE: I have read some of the thread on the cruise control problems, but
no response addresses my problem specifically:

The cruise used to engage all the time, and work fine (needless to say, but
said!)  Recently, it would engage, but mysteriously shut down.  It was not
a bump in the road, or anything, just whenever it "took a notion to."  More
recently, it won't engage at all.  One point:  a tiny "click" is heard when
pulling back on the "set" handle.  Sounds like a relay click.  seems to
indicate some electrical activity.

  I have eliminated vacuum as the culprit.  All bulbs are good and the
brake light switch isn't intermittent.  Can any one recommend the
unabridged list of checks and tests?

RIDE: OK - call me stupid, but I'm a confessed newbie - the car (as opposed
to my SAAB 9000) is loud!  Fine, and expected to a point, but troubling:

The sound, which seems to me to emanate from the back - sounds just like
you are riding in a Jeep with heavy lugged off-road tires.  I can't think
of a better way to describe it - it's accurate. The same deep "whirrrrr"
relative to speeds.  I have Pirelli P7's. The sound did not change with a
tire rotation - front to rear.  (Be gentle - did I buy a lemon, or "shut up
and enjoy it.")  

STEREO:  My factory stereo is ready to go to heaven.  The question:

The mid-speakers (mounted at the seat belt housing, directly beside the
rear passengers) seem to be an odd size.  What is a good replacement, using
the factory surface-mount grilles.  I would use aftermarket grilles, but
the compound curves of this location make for a challenge.  And how about
the 4" (?) speakers under the rear quarter windows.  Necessary?  useful?
Any other stereo/speaker recommendations are welcome and requested.

MISC.:  Is there a decent aftermarket shop manual (under $50)

Is there an aftermarket supplier for new seat leather?

My pod is cracked - any do-it yourself solution that looks good?  Dash is
new.

Any aftermarket front floor mats that fit - navy blue?

A dozen thank-you's 
-Steve (StevePeck@viperlink.net) 
bandwidth bandit - sorry.  I will be a good contributor in the future.
