I pulled the tumbler off the door.  (you will probably need to remove
the inside
panel if you have an alarm system. 

What I did was to blow brake cleaner through the mechanism and wiggling
the key.
Surprise, the key started to turn and the fluid, now looking like black
mud, drained
out.  I wipped the tumbler as much as I could and sprayed it again
followed by some
wipping and again until the stuff coming out was clean.  I followed with
a generous
aplication of graphite (not entirely voluntary but man does this stuff
come out of
the tube fast...).

Using graphite is probably not the best choice if you have an alarm
system.  In
the Factory book (which I read later...) recommend against anything that
might conduct
electricity to avoid the alarm system to arm itself.

I was not able to take the tumble apart.  It looks like there is some
press pin
on each side that would need to come out.  If you actually need to take
the
tumbler apart, give Mark a call at 928 international.  He informed me
that he
sells the waffers that goes in the tumbler.  That would mean that the
tumbler can be taken
apart...

Hope this help.
