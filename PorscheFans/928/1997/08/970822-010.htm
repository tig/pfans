Hey,
I'm back even though no one has answered my questions!
I see Joe is looking for a very similar car as me (Joe has good taste!)
and his questions are getting answered. I guess I will just have to
settle for the responses to Joe's questions.
For anyone who is curious about prices, I looked at a '89 S4 w/45,000
mile, auto and not in the greatest condition...asking $25,900. It was at
a dealer here near Akron, Oh. I thought it was over-priced, but what do
I know. They also had a '90 GT for $35,000, but they let a salesman take
it home with him for the weekend. Seems stupid to me if they want to
sell it. Then again if I was the saleman I'd probably do the same thing.
I never saw the car.
I really want a GT and it has to be a '89 or newer. Am I dreaming???
You guys don't always put down 911's, do you??? Is that why you won't
answer my questions???
