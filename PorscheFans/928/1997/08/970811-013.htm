Don't worry about the fuel distributor.  It is doubtful you'll reach the
limit of it as it's limit is about 400hp, stock.  By increasing the
system control pressure, everything (including injectors) scales up
nicely for support of 600hp (930s are modified like this).

Although I don't know this value, I don't think this will ever limit
you, either.
>> 
>> What is the serial # for this fuel distributor ('78-'79)?

From all my experiments, it appears you can use any year fuel
distributor.

Easily 700+hp

>o The valvetrain can only take so much

This is entirely an RPM issue.

>o The wallet can shell out only so much

Unfortunately, this is the Ultimate Limit. :-)
