This is pretty common for the dealer to refer you to an "affiliate".
Sonnen did the same for me when I got an estimate to repair the shipping
damage done to the nose of my GT...  Luckily the  body shop is just
across the street in this case...

Matt, stop driving your car!!!   Something is bent bad and driving it
further will only make it worse!  Do not submit any claims until you
find the true extent of the damage.  I don't know the quality of shops
in your area, but you do have access to an authorized dealer at least
right?

Good luck - hope you get it back in road worthy trim soon!
Phil
