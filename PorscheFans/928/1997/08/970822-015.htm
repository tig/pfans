Mark Fling,

> First, according to "Project 928", the car has exactly 89.3 pounds of aluminum 
in the engine lid, doors, and front fenders.  Since the car weighs between 3373 
('79) and 3600 ('95) lbs, I don't know where 17 percent aluminum came from.  
Maybe a little less Greek symbology and a little more long division might help 
you calculate percentages, Eddie.

Bztztttt!

Sorry, that was 19% and I think it's safe to say that _his_ stats wouldn't
include the weight of the tires, wheels, interior, etc...

You can do your simple math with the overall weight of a 928, but that's not
going to yield anything close to what Eddie is calculating.

Try an impact test and find out.

Stressing Al causes failures. Sorry. Think about this, Mark. Ever see a set of
springs made out of aluminum?  Do you know about the early 928 lower ball joint
mount failures?

Finally, I think Eddie was going overboard, but he does have one point right.
