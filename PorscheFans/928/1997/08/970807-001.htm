Haven't heard of an S3 before. S2, yes. I'm currently looking at an '85 USA
LHD S2 down here in NZ to use as a race car. It is illegal to sell a LHD
car in NZ, so the poor sod who's got it is having to sell it at a discount.
Any potential owner cannot use it on the road, so it's only of use to
someone who wants to use it elsewhere. Damn shame, says Andy!

Looking at the wiring diagrams on the '83 USA L-Jetronic, I have noticed
something very interesting (which also applies to the K-Jetronic as well).

The fuel pump relay has some extra electronics mounted in it and an extra
wire coming out. That wir goes to the engine control unit _and_ is fed from
a signal from some extra electronics in the Auto Trans Kick-down relay.
This tends to suggest that the fuel pump is usually run at less than
full-noise, and that when the kick down switch is operated, the pump is
given an extra burst of current to increase fuel pressure.

If this is the case, it might be interesting to try doing the "extra
kick-down switch mounted on the rest pedal" modification, and standing on
it while cranking if the car is being stubborn.

Who knows?

The LH fuel relay (from looking at the '85 diagram) is just a plain relay,
so there's no magic involved there.

Looking at the '85 diagram, the fuel pump relay also provides power to the
following:

Auxilary air valve
Auxilary Fuel Pump (fitted to Japanese & Australian versions only)
All 8 fuel injectors
The Oxygen Sensor.

So if your Fuel Pump Relay isn't going, you're not going to go _anywhere_!
From this, I'd be more inclined to call it a "Fuel System" relay!

On a seperate note, I say an advert listed in the Porsche advert system
where a Canadian guy was after a right hand drive 928. Two questions:

1. Why on earth would he want one?

2. Would there by _any_ RHD 928's in North America?

OK. Make that 3 questions...

3. If there were, surely they'd be worth less than a LHD one?

Cheers,
