Why don't we all email our true feelings to "Automobile" mag?

> Sorry about the WOB, but just received and read  an article about
Chrysler's Prowler in the September issue of Automobile magazine and came
across a statement that flat-out boggles the mind for its stupidity.
>=20
> The author, Eddie Alterman, is discussing the problems of constructing
car bodies in aluminum, specifically problems with torsional and bending
rigidity.  We've all heard the technical rationale for  avoiding aluminum
in load-bearing members of the body structure (low modulus of elasticity,
weak spot welds, blah, blah, blah), and Alterman tries to impress us by
spouting off some odd-ball formula replete with Greek symbols.  Fine so
far.  The author goes on to state the reason for low-resale value of the
928 was it's aluminum construction!
>=20
> What?!!!
>=20
> Specifically: "According to this equation, the 928, which is made of 19
percent aluminum, loses 17 percent of its rigidity - along with much of i=
ts
appeal - after 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles)."  Yup, you read that
right!
>=20
> First, according to "Project 928", the car has exactly 89.3 pounds of
aluminum in the engine lid, doors, and front fenders.  Since the car weig=
hs
between 3373 ('79) and 3600 ('95) lbs, I don't know where 17 percent
aluminum came from.  Maybe a little less Greek symbology and a little mor=
e
long division might help you calculate percentages, Eddie.
>=20
> Second, since when are doors and engine lids structural?
>=20
> Third, I guess Eddie's got scads of mail about disgruntled 928 owners
swindled when they discovered their 170 mph GTs were as limp as day-old
linguini.  "I swear, I was just driving along, and man, that aluminum fro=
nt
end got goosey on me and just flew off!  Damned near beaned an old lady o=
n
a bus bench."
>=20
> Is it any wonder why 928 owners are so disgusted sometimes about all th=
e
disinformation.  Hell, I expect the next story will be "928 unintended
deaccelleration, next on Hardcopy!"
