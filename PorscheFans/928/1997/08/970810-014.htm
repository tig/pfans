Ok boys and girls, here comes my question for the week.

I'm sure the wax topic has been discussed in the past, but I haven't 
been a list member (or 928 owner) for too long so I missed it.

First of all, when I bought my car I was aware of the imperfections 
in the paint and ready to accept them for the time (I really wanted a 
black one :-).  Some of the problems have been solved with careful 
use of touch up paint.  There are, however, several spots (mostly on 
the hood) that need attention.  The spots are generally about a penny 
size or less but are white.  They feel rough to the touch but are not 
worn all the way to bare metal.  I can't tell the depth, but it 
doesn't feel all too deep.  Washing doesn't help.  I have not tried 
anything yet (mainly due to lack of time) but am ready for some 
suggestions.  I really don't want to paint the spots, but if I have 
to I will.

Along those lines...  Once I get the paint to an acceptable level, I 
plan to buff it and wax it.  What experience have you all had with 
various products?  I'm interested particularly in had buffing vs. 
machine and what compound to use (I assume not too abrasive).  What 
kind of cloth or applicator should be used?  Also, wax techniques and 
brand recommendations would also be appreciated.

I'm a detailing idiot, please enlighten me!  

Thanks in advance
