I am concerned about the reply to the warm start problem for the 1983S. I
also have a 1983S that has recently developed a problem starting after it
has been run for awhile.I believe the problem to be in the fuel delivery
system, because if I start the car up very soon after shutting down, there
is some hesitation and slight misfire, eratic running, for a few minutes.
If the vehicle is not started right away and sets for fifteen minutes or
so, It will not start, no matter how long you crank! After it sets for
about an hour it starts fine.
My mechanic has suggested that because my car sets for long periods of time
that there could be some varnish build up on the injectors, or a faulty
fuel pump. We have dumped some super duty injector cleaner in the gas tank,
last week and have noticed some improvement. If my problem had been a
starter/battery  cable, I don't believe the engine would have cranked at
all. any comments would be appreciated.
