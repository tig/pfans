I would catogorize this as preventive maintenance/Rust prevention:
Ever sice I purchased my 90 S4, occasionally (usually on a date) a leaf
or small twig would fly out of the center vent at Mach 9 and either fly
by my ear and land somwhere behind me or land in my passengers
hair/face...Very embarrasing!  I found the source of the flying leaves.
Under the hood between the engine compartment and the cabin of the car
there is a small space where the wiper motor, climate control blower
moteor and other various devices reside.  On the passenger side below
the blower motor, there is a well from which the blower gets the air for
the climate control system.  Needless to say this deep well was full of
leaves and stuff.  So full that trying to vacum the compartment ruined
my shop vac!  The next step I put off until I had a complete Saturday
open.  I remoced the blower motor, one of the screws that hold it in the
back mounts from the inside of the car.  Then I removed the box mounted
in the well, it came out from the inside(above the fuse panel) and found
a large amount of very high quality compost, comprised of decomposed
leaves dire and small twigs.  After cleaning it out cmpletely and
reassembling every thing, I have a few tips:
1, Remove the glovebox completely by the hinges.
2.  Cover the fuse panel with a large towel, to save having to clean the
fuse panel after a ton of grit falls into it.
(I did this and I saved what I could guess as several hours it would
take to clean the panel.)
3.  To get the blower motor out I removed the rear hood hinge bold and
pivoted the fron of the hood downward to 
raise the rear of the hood so the blower could clear the hood.

I'm glad I went through what my neighbor called a labor of love, because
if all of the junk I removed had stayed there rust would have been a
sure thing. Due to the location of this I might have had water dripping
on the fuse panel after a few years, (A major nightmare!)  I plan on
keeping my S4 for a long time.
