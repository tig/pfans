   Well, I must be a bit color blind.  Last night I measured the mysterious
   resistor (which _was_ wired in series) and it measured 1K ohms.  I looked
   at the resistor under an incandescent light instead of florescent and 
   the colors are: tan resistor with violet, black, red, gold bands.
   
   Last night I also combed through my car's records to see if I could find
   any clues as to why the resistor was there.  Turns out that the Porsche
   dealer _might_ have installed it in 1986 after the PO brought the car 
   in with complaints about "hard starting when cold, hesitates, stalls".  The
   mechanic's remark on the repair order says "adjust temp sensor for cold
   running".  Inserting a resistor in-line seems like an odd way for a
   dealer to solve a problem.  Anyone aware of a Porsche tech bulletin that
   might have specified this?
   
   As always, mucho gracias to those that offered suggestions!
