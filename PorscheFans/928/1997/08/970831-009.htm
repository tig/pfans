Anyone out there interested in a 1985 928S?  Well, mine is for sale as of
right now!  You can check it out on Phil Tong's page at:

http://www.928s4vr.com/vsoo.htm

It has 52,000 miles on it.  Automatic trans, heated seats, full leather
interior, updated headlights to 8".  It is in VERY good shape.  Only one
thing I know of that doesn't work properly is the drivers side heated seat.
 It gave up the ghost last year.  Other than that, a couple minor scratches
on the hood.  No rear air.
Asking $16,000

I just got back from checking out the 87.

The great news is the owner is an acquaintance of mine so I know the
history of it.  We also use the same mechanic.  So before he ever
entertained the thought of selling it, I always asked my mechanic about ANY
928 that was in his shop including the one I hope to get & he always said
"It's probably the cleanest one in town."

So that's great news & as soon as mine is sold, that sucker is mine!!! :0

Thanks for the advice Leonard & I probably will get it for less!

P.S.  Hopefully this one will beat my Buick GN!
