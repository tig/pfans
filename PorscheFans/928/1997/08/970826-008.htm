On my 85, you do not need to pull out the center console.  What you 
need to remove is the carpeted side portion of the console.

For this, remove the luggage tray under the dash (on the side you want
to change the switch)
Then remove the side pannel (a few scews here and there)
Gently pop out the old window switch and lightly tug on the wires.
Now that you have identified which wires are the one for the
switch, follow them until you reach the connector,
Unplug the connector, take the old swicht out and install
everything back in its place.

Good luck...
