James,

I tend to concur. I think that in general, heat accellerates chemical pro=
cesses, cold slows them down, or stops them utterly. Like, for instance, =
iron oxydization.

For car storage, cold and dry would seem the best, just dry second best, =
hot the worst. A brave - read foolish? - assertion: Heated non-dehumidifi=
ed garages cost once for the fuel, again for the rust. So when you read =
an FS ad "heated garage", think minus sign.

To me, a curious thing is that rust is affected by moisture at all. Sure,=
 water has oxygen in it, the O in H2O, and I suppose, but am not sure, =
it is that O that combines with the iron, FE, to make FEO, (or is it FEO2=
 or what?), AKA rust. But  air, too, has oxygen, so why doesn't iron rust=
 in hot dry air? I took chemistry as part of my engineering degree, but =
I have forgotten why dry iron doesn't rust. Anyone?

Would also like to know if iron oxydization has a threshold temperature =
below which the process stops.

Also interesting to know if there are other chemically deteriorating proc=
esses which speed up in heat or slow significantly  in cold, and if they =
have a threshold.

Wondering if just as we lose by heating in the winter, do we save, net, =
by A/C in the summer? To what temperature? Garage insulation?

I have windows in my south-facing garage door. Worthwhile to put that sil=
very film on them to reduce garage temperature? Some other film? Anyone =
know any specifics about household/commercial window films? Better to put=
 it on the inside or the outside?

I just replaced the door, and I think I made a mistake by ordering plexig=
lass windows instead of glass. I think I read years ago that you can't =
get a tan much in a glass greenhouse because the glass blocks maybe 98% =
of the UV, whereas in a plastic greeenhouse you can get a tan or melanoma=
.. I suppose my paint feels the same way about UV. You think?

Anyone use Car Cocoon or any kind of air-tight thingamabob around your =
car? Ever think of filling it with other than air, like maybe nitrogen? =


How about vacuum? Of course, that would suck the cocoon to the car, but =
would that help or hurt? If you were concerned about the plastic sticking=
 to the paint, you could put a light cotton cover inside the plastic.

Bumper sticker for those who try it?:

VACUUM SUCKS!

In either case, if the cocoon were nitrogen or vacuum tight, could you =
turn off the nitrogen supply, the vacuum pump, the A/C and the dehumidifi=
er and still get little or no rust?

James - anyone - do you dehumidify your entire garage, or just cocoon(s)?
