I recently attended New Hampshire Intl Speedway (North East Region's
Driver's Ed) on August 4th, and had a pretty eye opening experience. 
During the cool down lap, I shifted into fourth gear in my '89 S4 and
noticed the shifter had about 40 degrees of longitudinal play while in
gear! (not the best feeling entering the oval at over 110 MPH).  I nursed
the car around the course (4th gear was the only gear I could choose) and
after pitting, started asking around if anyone knew what could be wrong. 
To my luck, the sponsor had seen this problem in 928s before and
immediately had a fix.  He told me the ball cup connecting the guide rod to
the front of the central tube had popped off and, although it was hard to
get to, it could be "popped" back on.  With the help  of my instructor
(thanks Ralph), we took off the belly pan and started searching for this
joint.  Way, way up above the central tube, with the heat shield bent out
of the way, we could see the ball socket had popped off.  Unfortunately, no
top access (bad design, Porsche)  We borrowed a coat hanger and snaked a
nylon strap up over the shift tube in an effort to pop it back in.  It
looked in, but as soon as we did any shifting, it popped back off again. 
Needless to say, Driver's Ed for me was over for the day.  I tied the nylon
strap to the belly pan to keep down force on the tube/socket and drove it
home (140 miles) this way.  

Now to the subject of this e-mail:
I went into the archives and found the info on the 928 FAQ under "9. Clutch
& Transmissions; 9.1 Changing ball cup on shifter for a more precise
shifting" by Kurt Gibble.  This is GREAT info.  It supplemented where my
$300 workshop manuals left a large gap.  This made getting to the ball
socket relatively easy.  I have a couple additions to paragraph 5 of this
procedure (removing the exhaust).  My S4 did not have a 17mm center support
hanger behind the catalytic converter, just two supports on the rear
muffler, and one on each intermediate muffler.  In addition, when lowering
the rear muffler, there's an 8mm bolt on the drivers rear wheel well which
needed to be loosened to allow the rear muffler mounting bracket to clear
the rear body.  I was able to lower my exhaust in one piece from the cat to
the rear muffler.  Another difference was that on the passenger's side
connection between the catalytic conv. and the exhaust manifold, there is
also a CO Test Pipe which needed to be disconnected.  The rest of the
procedure went without a hitch.  

I ordered the socket and hope to get it in a week (not using UPS).  I'll
send an update on the installation.  Hope this helps anyone trying to do
this on your own.  I will now carry that nylon strap and the coat hanger in
my emergency tool kit just in case...

Awaiting parts in Rhode Island,
