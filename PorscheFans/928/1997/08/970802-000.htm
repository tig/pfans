Ouch - that hurts! I feel like I have to become the "Leonard" for the German
Language when I read this...

Well, if you want to translate "There is no substitute" correctly, it would
read:

     "Es gibt keinen Ersatz" (Note the difference in GRAMMAR!!!)

However, "Ersatz" also means "replacement". Imagine how odd the tagline would
flow if it was: "There is no replacement". That's about how "well" the German
translation flows - not qualified for big time advertising use...

Here is another one: In Excellence October 97, page 116 you can find an ad of
"Supercharging of Knoxville", calling their "Black Cat": "Schwarz Katze".
Someone actually went through the trouble of creating an ad without
consulting anyone knowledgable in the foreign language they were using (It
should say: "Schwarze Katze"). I wonder, if their supercharging kits are as
"professionally engineered" as their ad...

Sorry for rambling on about this with my own broken English. I'm just saying:
If you can't do it right, don't bother with it, or ask for help... (same
thing applies to 928 repairs at home, I believe)

Amen.
