Yes, the front lower air dam and rear spoiler were part of option 474
for the 1982 model year (1981 also, I believe).  According to PCNA,
option 474 has meant different things for different model years.  For
1982, the "Sport Package" included the spoilers, manual sport seats,
sport shocks (Bilsteins - green) and forged Fuchs 16" disc wheels and
16" tires.  There is also a reference to this in a review in one of the
auto mags of the time which has been reprinted in the "Porsche 928
Portfolio". 

BTW, the reason this was not called a 928S is that the engine was NOT
enhanced.  The true 928S as marketed in the USA for model years 1983&4
had the 4.7L (M28.19) engine.  Mine still has the 4.5L (M28.15) engine.

And, to further confuse the issue, the Technical Spec book shows the
4.7L 928S "USA + Japan" version as being available 1980-1984.  I don't
think this version was actually sold in the US until 1983&4. However, I
can't confirm that.
