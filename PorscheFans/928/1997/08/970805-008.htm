Yeah, this is a hard lesson I learned and I'm still paying for that
education :)

I did get the fill plug out before dumping the goo.  Would be seriously
uncool if I dumped the oil and couldn't open the fill plug.  That was the
first thing I did (its out of order in my chronology).

I used Valvoline Synthetic 75w-90 GL-5.  I wanted to get RedLine NS, but no
supplier had it in stock and I was getting itchy to try out any synthetic. 
Maybe this is the problem -- maybe Valvoline just sucks.  Maybe I'll send
my SO on a nice vacation to Bermuda for a few days if I can get my hands on
some Redline... :)
