Andy,

  I just want to verify that you indeed had K-Jetronic on an '83 Euro model.
  I believe that US-spec cars had moved on from K to L-Jetronic in '80 and 
  then to LH in '85.  I know that 16v Euro cars got the LH setup at some 
  point ('84?), but if you had K in an '83, this would indicate that Euro 
  cars may have skipped L altogether.  Maybe this is what happened, but it 
  does strike me as odd...
  
  Since I _still_ have an intermittent starting problem with my '83 U.S.-spec,
  I'm definately interested in all hints (like yours) which might help me solve 
  the problem.
