I have a set of after market "3-piece" 17" wheels for sale which I took
them off of my 93 GTS. I believe they are 3.6 Turbo replica wheels (there's
a picture of them in the Wheel Enhancement ad in the October 1997 issue of
Excellence), two (2) 8 X17 and two (2) 9 X 17. The rims are polished
aluminum, the centers chrome plated and they come with chromed center caps
and valve stems.

They are in excellent condition and have no scratches or flaws. They were
sold in 1994 as "AKT-Alpha Prestige Type S/W" wheels, $634 and $650 each
for the two sizes. I would like to get around $1000 for the set. Is there
is any interest out there? I'm in Davis, California and will be unavailable
in September.
