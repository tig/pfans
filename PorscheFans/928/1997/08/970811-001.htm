Your problem sounds similar to what I found when I bought my last 928GT.
 As far as I can tell, and was told to me, this is due to dust, small
stones, flies, etc that hit the front of the car at high speeds.
According to my source, this problem is mostly found with cars that were
driven on high speeds a lot of the time (My car is an import from
Germany with the speed limitless Autobahns).  Due to the impact the
paint just chips off.  The only thing to prevent this is to use one of
those huge black rubber condoms:-):-):-), you sometimes see over the
front nose of a car.  Very ugly though.

He recommended, since this is really damaged paint, to respray the car.
Using touch up paint helps too, but you will always see the spot where
the paint was applied clearly.  It is the most expensive solution, but
after it was done, the car looked even more beautifull then it was
before.

I do not know if you have a metallic paint, as far as I know the black
paint Porsche used for the 928 is a metallic paint, but I was told never
to use abrassive products on metallic paint.  Reason for it being that
you will reach the opposite of what you intended.  The paint will loose
its gloss and shine.  Unfortunately I can not give you anything on
products, cause products used in the US are probably very different to
the ones used here in Europe.  My local Porsche dealer though
recommended to just use a special wax for metallic paints.  According to
him this should keep the car in picture perfect shape.

Good luck, Leon
