Well, in my opinion, very few cars have any investment value at all, They
are depreciating assets. And they require insurance, storage and
maintenence that defeats any increase in value of less than 15% a year.
Granted, you can drive this asset, but the more you do, the greater the
depreciation.

You have the right attitude: buy what you like and enjoy it, and try to
maintain as much of the value as you can.

According to Sports Car Market newsletter, the typical 928 dropped 9% last
year in value. So keep you r investmenis in stocks and bonds. Not
sheetmetal.
