Keith,

I replaced the temperature sensor on the dash of my '89 S4, what a pain.  In order to replace the sensor, the dash had to come
out...  There are two bolts behind the center vent, as well as two screws on each side of the console (below ignition and below/left
of glove box).  You also have to remove the glove box to get to a screw (after removal look up/left, you will see a hole, the screw is
there) that attaches the center piece to the rest of the dash.  Also, there are screws attaching the console at the point where the
window switches are and near the shifter (not positive about shifter).

Hope this helps

Nelson

'89 928 S4/5 Speed
