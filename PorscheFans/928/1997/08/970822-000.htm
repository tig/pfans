I guess this is a question that is asked several times a year,
so I'm going to be the one asking it this time.....

I finally decided to buy myself a Porsche. Like most people, at
first I wanted a 911, but after reading some road tests I thought
'why settle for something inferior, let's go for the 928' (a much
better Horsepower/Price ratio than any 911). The one I'm interested
in is a '83 928S2 (The european model, so it should have some 310 BHP).
It has 130K km on it (about 80K miles).

However, since this is a 14 year old car, I'm a bit afraid I'm
going to be paying a small fortune on maintenance. So what I'm asking
is:
-What can I expect in terms of maintenance costs (any '83 928 owners
 out there.....could you share your experiences) ?
-How do maintenance costs compare to any standard car (like for example
 a -yuk- Toyata).
-Are there any critical items which I should look at when buying this
 (or any) 928.

Any -how to get started on your first 928- info would be welcome.

BTW, how does the automatic hold itself ?? I would prefer a handshift,
but most 928's for sale around here (the Netherlands) come with an
automatic.

Thanks a lot.....

P.S. fortunatly I live some 10 Km (6 miles) from the German border....
     So speeds of 200+ should be well within range :-)
