Nope, goes down just fine - if you want to get there quickly, stick a
small pebble in the valve stem and then screw the cap on halfway (I'm
sure you know that "trick").

If my numbers are right, I measured a factor of 1.6 meaning a 250 lb.
spring would be effectively 150.  Really though, just measure it by
getting someone to sit on the front of the car and see how much the
fenders go down.  Divide the 2 and you have the rate (for both springs -
divide by 2 and you get for each).

Well I calculate 0.61" - again putting in a factor of 1.6, therefore you
must move one by about 0.38" which is a lot.  Has your car been in an
accident?  If not, you can measure the perches and see that there not
off by this much.  My money would be on an unleveled surface in which
case there is absolutely no reason to change.  Tough to debug after the
fact - I'd strongly suggest making a known measurement before adjusting
anything.

You've got to seriously tilt the car to do this.  Add lead to move the
weight back - just make sure it's bolted down in case you hit
something.  After changing springs, I'd suggest living with the gross
handling deficiencies of your car (wanna trade?).

Best,
