Hoping someone out there can provide some help with the 928 wiring 
system from Hell!  Have been fighting what I suspect is a grounding 
problem in the instrument cluster on 82 928.  Symptoms:  Temp gauge 
reads about 1/8" high and jumps another 1/8" to nearly the red zone 
when parking or headlights switched on.   Voltmeter only works when 
outside temp gets below freezing (quess how many times a year that 
happens in Houston!).  Tach and mpg gauge on bottom of tach sometimes 
don't work until I gently tap on right side of cluster hood or 
shroud.  Sometimes gas gauge needle will also move when lights 
switched on.  Remedies tried:  Noticed that the three female card-edge 
connectors on back of instrumet cluster produced some of above 
behavior when wiggled. Dismamted instruments cluster. Noticed that 
contacts between the female sockets and the male connectors were not 
alligning perfectly (entire back of cluster is plastic flex circuit 
which forms male contacts by folding over 3 plastic extrusions).  My 
technicians are experienced at flex circuit work in very small 2-way 
radios so we hard-wired around all the male/female contacts on all 
3 flex circuit connections.  No fix!  Sorry for all the detail but 
expect some of you are having similar problems with <90 928's and 
this might help some of you realize what you are dealing with.  The 
flex circuit male and cable harness female connectors are a very bad 
for this application and are quaranteed failure points.  Add to this 
the Porsche failed bulb detection circuitry and the fun begins!  Would
welcome any experience out there.
