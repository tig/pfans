Err, I did my S4 myself - it does take some patience.  Total parts cost
was something like $80 + $40 for updated cam cover plugs and retainers. 
I didn't take the intake off - just the air snorkels and loosen the EGR
valve mounting on the right hand side.  My guess why these start to leak
is that the grommets on the bolts harden and no longer put on any
pressure.  It's a neat design - the bolts get torqued tight as they have
a stop on them.  They're the right length that then the grommets put the
right amount of tension of the valve cover gasket.  Somebody may know
the flat rate time - I'm guessing under 3 hours.

Best,
Kurt
