I think the wheels I like have the GTS offsets, no spacers. I have none
on my car anyway.  Robert at Wheel Enhancement was surprised that I had
no spacers. Should I be?  Did my previous owner lose them? Argh.

>Please let us know what you get and how it works for you.

The stage is set, the goal is identified, and when funds allow, the new
factory "dyno" wheels will be mine!!!

Kinda "busy" for a Porsche, but so am I!
(4 months to do head gaskets, jeez how embarrassing..)

Leonard, (or anyone w/GTS wheels and tires)
Would you, at your leisure, _this is NOT urgent_, make a measurement of
your rear wheel height (or circumference if the mood strikes you) with
the 255's you are running.  I am beginning to suspect speedometer
inaccuracy and I might just have "toodarnsmall" tires on the rear
(225/50-15).  I seem to be constantly shifting!
(Rm,rmm,rmmm,rmmmm,75mph) Almost like a close ratio trans or something!
(oh no...is there such a thing?)

Thanks again!
