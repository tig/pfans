As you probably don't know the last time the belt was replaced, I recommend
you DO NOT DRIVE THE CAR, and have it booked in for a timing belt and water
pump replacement immediately.

Once those two items are replaced, the chances of your engine lasting a
very long time are greatly increased.

I had a friend buy a '87 S4 here in NZ off a dealer. The engine had been
previously overhauled and timing belt replaced. Part way though his 600km
delivery trip, the crank pulley popped off the front of the crank
(incorrect torque setting) and he immediately waved goodbye to about 20 of
his 32 valves.

The dealer picked up the tab.

Golden rule of 928 purchasing: Unless you can positively identify the last
time the timing belt was replaced, get it done as soon as you buy the car,
and before you "put the boot in".

Cheers,
