In my quest to keep the car from overheating when sustaining 5,000 rpm
for 10 min, I've confirmed that the cool S4 electronics are OK (when car
overheats - flaps are wide open and both fans are running full speed).

The next easy/most likely thing is the thermostat which I removed last
night.  Naturally, the 928 thermostat does not look like the one out of
a Buick.  It looks like when the thermostat is closed, the water pump
circulates the coolant through the engine.  As the engine warms, then
the thermostat serves as a mixing valve and proportions water to the
radiater and away from recirc.

Can someone confirm or correct this?  What happens if I run with no
thermostat as a test?  The only thing that looks at all amiss is the
inner seal (on the recirc part) which is now really gooey rubber.  The
boiling water test on the thermostat (per factory manual) is OK -
actually it moved 10 or 11 mm instead of 8.

TIA,
Kurt
