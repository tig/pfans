Jerry,

My '85 had the same problems when I bought it.  The passenger seat problem
was fixed by soaking the internals of the switches with WD-40 (being
careful not to get any on the seat).  The contacts wear down and/or get
dirty.  Sometimes they just need cleaning as was the case with mine.
They're still working fine after 4 yrs.

The electric trunk lid release is another matter.  I wrestled with that
thing, replacing almost every part one at a time, until I finally gave up.
No amount of adjustment of either the top or bottom latch would make it
release the lid.  The motor runs fine, but it's still on my list of things
to fix.  There have been some very resourceful posts on this subject on
this list in the past.  I believe someone fashioned a metal tab to
effectively extend the travel of the plastic cam which did the trick.
