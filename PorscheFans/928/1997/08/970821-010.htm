Hi P-Fans...  I have an '80 928 (5-speed) that despite my love for the car
needs to go... Why?  New marriage (w/two new children making it 4 total!

                                    never saw the rain (yeh sure!)
 Third Owner   : Springfield, Illinois insurance agent that figured out the
911 was not the ultimate driving machine, bought the 928, got married, had a
kid, sold car.. (7/93 - 6/96)
  Fourth Owner:  ME!   (6/96 - now...)

interested it talking about a trade of some sort as well...

Damage History:
Car was hit in front right QP two owners ago.  (pre 1993)  Repair (if any) to
suspension/undercarriage/wheel was excellent!  (no pulling, bad tire wear
etc.)  Paint repair was average.  There is a chip in the paint on passenger
side back corner of the hood.  Furthermore, the hood descends approx 1/8"
below the quarter panel in the same location.  (I know this description
sounds anal...but it is what it is!)  No other known damage history...

No RUST!!!  never seen snow by me...and according to PO never seen snow by
him.
