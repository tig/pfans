This past Sunday, I met with Brian Robinson and John Rayall. We talked 928
stuff and about the "Frenzy". Brian says I should remind the 928 PorscheFans
about the event on a regular basis. Here goes.

The first PCA Potomac Region,"928 Frenzy" is set for 9/27/97 from 9:00 a.m.
to 3:30 p.m. at "Auto Sportsystems Group" in Fairfax, VA. There will be
discussions on: brakes, drive-train, electrical system, exterior and
interior care/repair, potential modifications, parts availability, and
suspension components. Several 928s will be on lifts for "hands on" brakes,
electrical system, and suspension/undercarriage discussions. Also, Kim Crumb
will be our main guest speaker. Marc and Susan from "Devek Performance" as
well as Lucky Ekman (the EK in Devek) will be there. As if all that talent
were not enough, there will be door prizes compliments of "928
International" and "Devek Performance". Moreover, a highly modified and very
quick 928GTS may be available (if it's ready) for our viewing and listening
pleasure. Lastly, there will be a short discussion on the viability of
forming a "928 club" that would augment our PCA membership.

The cost (including lunch) is a modest $5 for each PCA member, and $10 for
each non-member. For more information send an E-mail to: eds928s@erols.com
or give me a call at:(703)481-9252 [before 10 p.m. eastern please].
Registration forms and directions to "Auto Sportsystems Group" will be sent
to those planning to attend. I will need the completed registration form and
a check for the appropriate amount made out to "PCA Potomac" by 9/20/97.

Hope to see you there and happy motoring. Ed Ruiz (86'928S)
.
