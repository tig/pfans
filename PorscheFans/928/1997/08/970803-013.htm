Was featured on the cover of Road & Track in the late '70's or very early 
'80's. And if my memory was right, VW of Germany built it. Not a dealer. 
One item from the article sticks in my mind, the windsheild cost $30k.

Even the final 928's had awful Cd's. Again something that sticks in memory, 
it took the front spoiler and rear lip to break under 0.40.

Keep in mind low Cd's are not the only criteria for aerodynamics on a high 
performance car. If you have downforce, then you have drag. Its far more 
important for a car such as the 928 to be stable at high speeds than to 
slip effortlessly thru the air.
