Well it seems like half the members have a cruise control problem so 
heres mine. I'm driving along the highway with the heat/ air turned off. 
Both levers all the way to the left. Turn on the cruise and heat starts 
coming out of the center vent. The cruise speed will also drop off 
slowly. I feel pretty sure that this is yet another vacuum problem but 
would be glad to hear from anyone who has any insight into this. Now the 
climate control module operates electrically so it must be controlling a 
bunch of electrically actuated valves somewhere. Can anyone tell me where 
they would be. I'm guessing down behind the radio somewhere but perhaps 
someone can save me some time here also.

A related question. There seems to be no way to get cool (air 
conditioning off) unheated air. Even with the temperature lever all the 
way to the left there is still some heat coming out. If I look into the 
center vent I can tell that part of the air is coming via the heater core 
(which is warm to the touch) which explains things I guess but the heater 
valve under the air filter is supposed to stop the coolant flowing 
through the heater isn't it? I've checked this valve and the lever on it 
actuates and releases just as you would expect. Is it possible the guts 
of the thing are shot and its letting coolant flow regardless of lever 
position? Anyone else had a problem with this.

Sorry folks, I seem to be posting a lot of questions lately. Tell me to 
shut up if you've had enough. Just in case a bunch of you do here's 
another while I can......

I still haven't fixed my cold start problem. I've found a bunch of things 
it isn't such as temperature sensors but still no luck. I will not let 
the bugger beat me however. I'll be measuring fuel pressure this weekend 
but am still leaning towards a vacuum leak because I also get hard shifts 
(auto) when cold and the only possible link between the two that I can 
think of is vacuum. Question, should the idle speed be higher when cold? 
Mine is not. Sounds like a dumb thing to ask I suppose but the 85's on 
have an idle speed regulator and I just assumed that it held the same 
idle speed at all times, hot or cold.
