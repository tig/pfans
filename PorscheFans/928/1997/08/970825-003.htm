Hi,

I developed a leak in one of my oil cooler lines, after pulling out the
hoses and the cooler, it seems like it is an add-on part, not something
Porsche would have done.  There are 2 big, braided hoses that come out
near the oil filter, then were tie-wrapped to the suspension hanger.
They then went up to the cooler, which was sitting behind and along the
left side of the radiator and tie-wrapped to the power steering
reservoir.  I remember some discussion on the list before about the oil
cooler being part of the radiator.  Can someone else with a similar car
(1979, Euro, S-300hp, 5-speed) or anyone for that matter, tell me what their car
has for oil cooling?  I want to make sure I put it back the way it is
supposed to be, not just the way it was.

Thanks,
Stephen Oetjen
