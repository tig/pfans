  My advice:  if you're often short on patience, pay someone else to
  do this.  Lack of patience and this task go together like oil and water,
  (or like lifting the throttle on a 911 in the middle of a fast turn...).
  
  Stephane's FAQ has the procedure under the Clutch & Transmission section:
  http://www.apci.net/~slyjay/Page9.html.  Kurt's instructions are the
  latest and greatest.

Standard email etiquette dictates that you don't capitalize all your
words. It's annoying for others to read and makes it look like you are
SHOUTING! You're forgiven.
