Did any of you see the Volkswagen commercial with the 928 and the VW Golf
(I think)?  It showed a big bug buzzing around over the highway as a Golf
approached it.  The bug did a few flips and twirls as it sailed over the
Golf's windshield but was none the worse for the encounter.  Then a Porsche
928 appeared heading straight for the bug.  SPLAT!  They bragged about how
the aerodynamics of the Golf are superior to the Porsche 928.

If I remember right, the original 928 has a poor aerodynamic profile -
something like .42 Cd.  As the years went by, Porsche added the front and
rear spoilers and then such things as automatic flaps in the grill to
improve aerodynamics.  I guess it wasn't too bad by 1977 standards, but by
today's standards, it's not very aerodynamic.  It sure LOOKS like it is,
though.
