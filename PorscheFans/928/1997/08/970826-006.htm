 The only reason Porsche switched to the single-disk was that it was
"difficult" to set them up properly.  I think this is bogus for two
reasons: a.) I have never had any difficulty with numerous clutch
installs, b.) The factory manuals are NOT correct regarding adjustment.
DEVEK has a little blurb on the correct way, if you're interested (or I
can post it).
  IMO, I consider this a "downgrade;" as the double-disk clutch is
stronger. (My '85 (w/double-disk) had a Camden supercharger for several
years; generating 2.5 times the stock torque in the 'normal' RPM range. 
Never even complained.)
 Although, I would be interested in hearing from others and their
experiences...
