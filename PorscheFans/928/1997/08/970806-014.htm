"I don't have any experience with the LH-Jetronic, so I won't be able
  to offer answers to those specific questions.  Regarding the cooling 
fan, 
  however, here is a response that John C. C. White had sent out on this 
  issue back in May.  (BTW, last year I replaced the switch coolant 
temperature
  switch on my '83 (on the lower right front of the radiator) with one 
that 
  would turn the electric fan on at a lower temp.  For months, the fan 
never 
  turned on when the temp gauge indicated that the fan was needed.  
Suddenly
  and without me making any other changes, the fan started working as it
  should and has been fine ever since.  Very strange...)................"

Thanks for the reply. I also have the fan switch on the radiator. This 
makes me wonder what the additional switch/ sensor near the thermostat is 
as I thought it might be the fan switch. Perhaps someone out there knows.

Thanks again
