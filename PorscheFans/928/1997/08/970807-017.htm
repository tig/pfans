<<It was an interesting conversation brought up by another list member.>>

What about it was even remotely interesting, or even remotely relevant to the
topic?


<<When you start to read the replies, I'm sure that you will see that

many members are much younger than you may think.>>  

That's just it.  I don't think about how old everyone is.  What a boring way
to spend your days.  And even if I did think everyone was old and gray, and
then I found out they were all in high school, so what?



<<We found the same thing on the 944 list.>>

I can only be glad that I don't subscribe to that list.  Sometimes these
off-the-subject threads get way out of hand.  It is your responsibility to
realize when enough is enough.  I didn't spend this time writing this until I
reached the limit.  I haven't gone through several digests yet, and am sure
to encounter more.  I think you should all subscribe to the tavern and talk
about your age, BMW's, and drug dealers when it is important to you.  This
obviously a kind of community we are in.  And talk off the subject happens,
but you will notice nobody complains until it gets way out of hand.  


A few comments off the subject go a long way to irritating others.  Everyone
on this list is tolerant.  But the same way we don't like to see 100+ message
digest because of repeating messages, we also don't like to plow through
bragging about what kind of diapers the list members were wearing when they
bought their cars.
