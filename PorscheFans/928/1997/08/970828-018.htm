A lot depends on what you want to do with the car. If you want to put
the car on the track, think about better tires and brake pads, then maybe
suspension, but mainly about spending your money and time going to
lots of driver ed events. Autocross, something similar. Drag strip,
ask some of those guys on the left coast. Or you can spend money on
making the car look newer/different, or on getting it into super
condition for concours. There's never enough money to do everything
you could, so you need to think about where you're headed. 

The 300 hp Euro cars have different cams, bigger valves, higher
compression, illegal emissions, etc. Probably cheaper to buy a
whole engine than to convert yours bit by bit, even if you do all
the labor. If you would be paying for the labor, it's probably
cheaper to buy a newer car, realistically.

>>ps...I have an awesome source for parts in Massachusetts if anyone is

>>dependant (example: low mileage S4 rack $225).

I'd like to know who/where the source is, since I live in Mass.
(though no dependent of mine ever saved me money!)
