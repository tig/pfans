With regard to the subject of battery  maintenance (charge).........

The 'battery tender' approach (product) is quite effective and should
not overcharge the battery if working properly.   It is designed as a
trickle charger, and is very effective for 928s since there is a
constant bleed off of the battery via the clock, radio, or other
accessory that draws a minor amount of current.

Using a timer/straight charger setup can be effective, but is really
more complicated and expensive (due to that complexity) than need be.
After using about every setup mentioned, especially with boats, it is my
opinion the battery tender setup is adequate.  The nature of our
lead/acid batteries is such that usage (meaning some amount of discharge
and recharge) is the best thing you can do to keep them in top shape.
The worst treatment of these batteries is to keep them fully charged and
never used.  As with most things about a vehicle, occasional use is much
better for the life of the component.

With complete regard and respect to Mr. Renfrew's experience, you now
have enough to make your own decision feeling safe that all views are
covered!   Gee...isn't that the way it seems with everything?    :{)

While I'm on my particle board stump.......can't help but comment on
prior dialogue regarding fuel storage additves.   I've used Stabil in
the past, and gave it up.   After troubles and discussion with others
trying various strategies, I decided to forego use.  Varnish and
breakdown of gasoline occurs much more rapidly at temperatures above
freezing, which can be a problem with cars stored in heated areas.  To
get to the point, I experimented with five cars and a boat over a six
year (six complete winters)  period in Wisconsin.  The most trouble was
use of Stabil in the boat (Chevy 350, stored outdoors, normally
carbureted).  The best all-around result was not using any additives at
all.   Two cars were stored over a two year period in unheated barns and
fired off with no trouble/stumble.   Since that time, i've not used any
additives and experienced no problems.   The only caveat is to keep the
fuel tanks relatively full to reduce condensation of moisture.

Okay........that's it.........the rest of you can opine away!
