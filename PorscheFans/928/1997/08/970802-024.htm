Hello everyone,
   not a good day today. I was driving my just washed 928 GT today when this
lady ran a stop sign and hit me hard in the front passenger side by the
wheel.  Heavy damage to the bumper,quarter panel, headlight... it looks like
the engine compartment got damaged from the impact also. Not to mention heavy
frame damage, the drivers side door rubs with the front quarter panel and I
was hit on the passenger side! I'm not sure of the damage bills yet but will
find out Monday. She was at fault so her insu. carrier better cover all of
this.  One other thing is my 2 week old rim was badly damaged also. I was
physically ok from the accident though.
