We've all heard the technical rationale for  avoiding aluminum in load-bearing members of the body structure (low modulus of elasticity, weak spot welds, blah, blah, blah), and Alterman tries to impress us by spouting off some odd-ball formula replete with Greek symbols.  Fine so far.  The author goes on to state the reason for low-resale valu

Since the car weighs between 3373 ('79) and 3600 ('95) lbs, I don't know where 17 percent aluminum came from.  Maybe a little less Greek symbology and a little more long division might help you calculate percentages, Eddie.

Mark,

Our car has a bit more aluminum but I would also disagree with the
writter's conclusion.  For the aluminum, the engine and the rear
"weissach" axle are made of aluminum.   This represent a significant
weight.

However, a well design car, even made out of aluminum, should last.  You
just have to look at the strenght of the material and beef it up
accordingly.  When the piece gets to be too big, use steel...
