Just wanted to say a word in favor of Valvoline. My favorite mechanic,
whom I trust as much as it is possible to trust any such, uses it.
I had Redline in my transaxle when the input bearing gave out, and
Valvoline in it now. For me, the main difference between dinosaur
and synthetic was in weather below say 40 degrees F. The shifting
was extremely difficult - stiff and grindy - with natural gear oil
when things were cold, much easier with synthetic. Synthetic is
not going to revive your old tired synchronizers, though. And I
don't think that the Redline had anything to do with the input
bearing failing (unless I hear from a bunch of you who had the
same experience).
