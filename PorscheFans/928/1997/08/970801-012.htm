Hi,

    I am sorry to say I have to sell my baby, in the past 2 years that I have had
it I have worked really hard at getting it back up to original specs (7k worth of
new parts and 3K of labor)!!! Worth of parts is probably more since I became friends
with the guy at the dealer and he is giving me 40 - 50% on parts!

108,000 miles, 5 speed, gold, sunroof, all power Blaupuk radio with CD, timing belt done
8k miles ago, 

Asking $13,500 or best offer....yes it seems high until you look at everything that
has been replaced and done, I loose the labor and 50% of parts cost. The car was 
bought originaly for 10K 2 years ago.
