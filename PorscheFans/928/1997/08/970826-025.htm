Well, consider a couple of things. The objective reason for the wing is to
provide downforce at high speed, counteracting the lift generated by the
overall shape of the car. A big wing will give more and tilting it forward
will give more still, both at the cost of additional drag, which will
prevent you from reaching as high a speed in the first place (as do very
wide tires, which is one reason why German performance cars tend to come
with relatively skinny ones, so that their owners aren't embarrassed on the
Autobahn).

There is such a thing as too much downforce (which could pitch up the nose
of the car, leading to more airflow underneath and sudden huge lift there;
just ask Mark Donohue), but I don't think you'll get that with this wing,
certainly not at speeds you're likely to travel.

Mounting the wing significantly higher can improve the downforce/drag
relation by putting the wing in clean air above the car. However, you must
provide a strong support (the downforce can certainly reach hundreds of
pounds, maybe lots more, with a big wing at high speed) and you must deal
with the effect on the avaricious populace and the boys in blue of the
Plymouth Superbird look.

At lower elevations, bear in mind that the wing will block part of your
rear view (something you very much want to have when you're traveling at
speeds at which a wing is needed). Alan's mounting obscures much more of
that view than the S4/GT/GTS mounting height (fairly low) and angle (almost
flat), and the outside mirrors won't make up for this.

You might just follow David Roberts' suggestion and put it at the height
and angle of the S4/GT/GTS wing, provided that Alan's wing has a real
inverted airfoil (bulgy on the bottom, flat on top) longitudinal cross
section. If it's just a flat panel, you'll need to tip it up a little at
the back to get a useful effect. If it does have an airfoil section,
remember to put the bulge on the bottom, lest you generate upforce (that's
what real wings do, after all).

Oh, while I'm being fussy, remember also that the ends of an overhanging
wing can interact interestingly with pedestrians. That's why the stock wing
isn't wider, and why the 911 Turbo's whale tail has rubber edges.

Even more fussy: a serious race-only wing would be mounted to the bodywork,
or better yet to major frame members (push those wheels back down!).
However, since you probably want to open your hatch now and then, it's to
the hatch you'll be mounting the wing.
