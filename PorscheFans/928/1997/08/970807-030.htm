I recently saw my first Euro 1984 engine.  Is yours a 16 valve with a
double distributor?  The one I saw had two distributors linked together
with a chain drive.  Each distributor had a cap with four wires.  The
TRIGGER UNITs probably fit inside of the distributor (under the cap) and
may be an electronic trigger for an electronic breakerless (no points)
ignition.  The trigger will replace points used in mechanical
distributors.  The I & II are probably for the two distributors.  I
don't know what FINAL STAGE means. It might be some kind of booster.=20
The fact that there are two (I & II) may mean that this part is located
on or near the dual distributors.  Since Porsche ignitions are designed
and made by Bosche, you might have better luck either with Bosche or
with a Porsche dealer in the UK or other European country.  No US 928s
have used the dual distributor kind of ignition system.
