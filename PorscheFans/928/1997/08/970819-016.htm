Since I'm fairly new to the car, and it has been quite hot lately, I have been
watching the temperature gauge with great interest.

The worst condition I've run across is going up the Sepulveda pass (a fairly
good grade), with its ever present stop and go traffic.  If it's in the
nineties, my car will reach the top white bar of the normal range going uphill.
 Once I reach the top of the hill, the temps fall quickly.  I have my front
vents "locked" into full open for the summer.

This is, of course, with the dual AC's cranking - Very nice option that dual AC
system!  I added Red Line's "water wetter" a few days ago to my coolant
expansion tank, and if anything it seems to indicate a little hotter on the
temperature gauge.  Of course, it may not have migrated into the coolant system
yet.  Anyone have any observations regarding water wetters' impact on
 temperature gauge readings?
