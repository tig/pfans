Nope - Lucky had a flash, secured the location, even mapped the lot out
with black spray paint and masking tape to arrange the 928s just right!
I tell you, this was just as much his day as it was for us, and am very
proud to have been a part of the event.  We went for a ride back in
'our' GT to pick up the cones and clean off the tape and you know, I
could still see all of the cars there in my mind's eye...  what a sight,
I'll never forget it!

> or placed yourself in the best location?

By chance I ended up being the second to the last car pulling in the
lot.  I think Paul Carver was the last 928 in.  Lucky was directing the
928 traffic and I recall he said, "Time to cork the bottle" as he
motioned me into position.  No kidding - again, by chance - I ended up
in the top left corner of the roof shot putting me as Car #1  :)   <hey
LL, I finally 'won' something >

Car #2?
Well, that goes to 928 #00029, oldest known in the US, as I brought a
picture that Phil Kalamaros sent me.  I put it  in a nice frame and held
it up for the photo shoot !!!

Car #3
Del Lisk's '91 GT

Car #4
I think Jim's S4

Once the pictures become available, we'll have to get everyone to ID
themselves like a class photo!  A tip for the future, next time we'll
need one of those aerial cameras on a balloon or something for the best,
highest overhead shot...Hmm, Lucky's a pilot...
Phil
