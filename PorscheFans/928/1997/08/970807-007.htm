Kurt,

  I can at least confirm that my understanding of the thermostat serving
  as a "mixing valve" and proportioning the water is the same as yours.
  
  I was having a problem with my car running hot (especially at the track),
  so I bought a new thermostat thinking that that was the problem.  (The
  brand was the OEM supplier to Porsche.)  Turns out that the original
  thermostat checked out o.k., so my next step was to buy a new temp 
  sensor that would start the electric fan at a lower temp.  (The temp 
  sensor was located at the lower right front of the radiator.)  That
  _eventually_ helped the car run cooler on the street, but I haven't
  had any track time since installation, so I can only hope that it will
  help that situation as well.
  
  Here's an interesting sidebar:  I recently did some major cooling system
  R&R on my wife's '89 MB 190E 2.6.  The thermostat on that car was exactly
  the same as the one on the 928 with one tiny exception.  The MB thermostat
  had a tiny (~2mm) bushing pressed into the round stamped steel "face" of
  the thermostat (i.e. the metal that makes the thermostat be ~2" in diameter).
  The bushing had a hole in it that would barely let a pin slide through.
  I'm not sure what the purpose of this was, but I attributed it to typical
  German over-engineering.  In any case, the thermostat from the MB would
  have interchanged with that of the 928, so perhaps our options have been
  expanded when considering a thermostat that would open at a different temp
  than the factory setting.

  The thermostat I bought didn't include a new seal.  Perhaps this is a
  dealer only part?
