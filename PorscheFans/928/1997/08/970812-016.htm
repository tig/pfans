"As I am still having my speedometer problems, does anyone know how to
     get to this sensor on an '82?  Has anyone replaced it already and 
have 
     an idea about cost and the amount of time spend under the car?"

Ed

On mine (an 85 auto) the sensor/ sender is mounted at the rear of the 
diff. Its a round plastic device that sits in a well and is held in place 
by a small wire "spring" that in turn has a single bolt (M5 I think) 
holding it to the differential. My speedo was intermittent and finally 
stopped working altogether. Inspection showed that the spring and its 
bolt were gone and the sender was hanging by its wire. This was after the 
torque tube bearings were changed so guess whose fault this was. Repair 
was as simple as replacing the spring and bolt. If yours is intermittent 
it might be worth checking that the sender is firmly located where it 
should be. I assume that a signal is inductively coupled from the 
differential in some fashion so good coupling is probably important. It 
might even be worth taking the sensor out and cleaning any debris that 
may have accumulated in there. The longest part of the process will be 
getting the rear up on jack stands. I hope your problem is something this 
simple.
