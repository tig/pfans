Hi Fernando

I have not been able to post to the list since it went down a couple
weeks ago.  Every few days I would try again.  

I saw your email about the rims on the list, so it is working.

I will be at Lime Rock on August 21, which is a Thursday.  The following
Sunday there is a PCA autocross at Smith and Wesson in Springfield, Ma. 
That should be fun, as 928s are rare in this club, and the last time I
went I upset a "regular", always the fastest 928 in the club (91 GT), by
beating his time (in an 84!).  He wasn't happy.

That should be an easy drive for you.  91 north to 291 East to exit 1 I
think.  

How is your car?  I am interested in what damage your car has suffered. 
What will it take to get it running?

Talk to you later.

Mark
