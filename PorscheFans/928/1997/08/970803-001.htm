Hi,

A month ago I was out driving. When I shifted gear from 4 to 5 I heard
this 'clonk' from beneath. To make a long story short I need a new
transmission (I hope you understand what I'm talking about as my
american technical language isn't the best.).
The model is 928 S '82 with a 5-speed manual. This is a european model
(4.7 litres and 300 HP) as I live in Sweden. I know there are
differences, but I thought I'd drop you a line anyway as there seems to
be a lot of knowledge 'over there'. I have localized a transmission from
a 928 S '85 or '86. Does it fit? Anybody? If not which ones does?
As it's quite expensive to get a new transmission here, I'm looking for
a contact in Germany. No success so far though. Does anybody know where
to turn to?

Jerker
