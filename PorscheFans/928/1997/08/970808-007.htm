No, it's the opposite.

>I need to clarify that I am assuming that the cooling system for an 928S
>and a 928-S4 is very similiar in design.  My 928S coolant flows from the
>radiator to the thermostat, thru the engine, the pump and back to the
>radiator.  (actually there is another route for the heater core, but
>we'll leave it out of this discussion for now...)  As far as I see it,
>the cooling system is a closed loop.  There is not an alternate flow
>route for the coolant.  When the engine is dead cold and obviously the
>thermostat is shut closed, the pump is creating a suction thru the
>block; its working real hard at this point.  Hopefully not for long
>since the engine will heat up and the thermostat will open in proportion>to the temperature >increase.  As the thermostat slowly opens, flow
>resistance will drop and coolant flow will increase thru the engine,
>pump and then back to the radiator; completing the loop.  In light of
>this explanation, I would say that the flow RATE to the radiator is more
>when you leave the thermostat out.  Back to the heater core... turn on
>your heater full blast and you will get a good amount of temperature
>drop too!  Please correct me if I am wrong... anyone.
