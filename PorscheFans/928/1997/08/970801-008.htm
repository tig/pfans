I can't believe it!   After all this time, I just stumbled onto this
newsgroup.  It would have been so helpful to have known a couple of
months ago.....but......there is still plenty of work to be done, and
I'm willing to share information as well.

In Feb, I purchased a dream.   A very ragged dream, but a dream
nevertheless.  It's a Euro '79 with lots of miles (130k) combined with
neglect.  The body was very straight, never wrecked, but in sore need of
paint and attention.   The engine smoked 'a little', and the interior is
shot.   Oh yes....did I mention the transmission that shifts like the
synchros were a faint memory of the past?   But, you must
understand........my interest is to take a beat-up bucket and save it
from extinction.   Done it with several US cars; always wanted to try an
exotic; always drooled over the styling of the 928.   I noticed most of
you are performance oriented, but my lust was always the design and
lines.

Anyway, at this point, the car should be out of the paint shop in a week
or so.   I've rebuilt the engine (just replaced the rings and bearings -
there is a story here for a later time), replaced the rear struts,
completely disassembled the interior, and generally tossed money out of
my wallet like having TWO wives!

So.....as far as what I can see in here.......I've learned a lot of the
mechanicals (my forte), and had to deal with just about every component
on the car.  There is still much I need in terms of advice and
experience, and I hope I can help some of you out like you've already
helped me via the archives.
