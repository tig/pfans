8) Drive other car to machine shop. Pay $15 each to have assembly
   heated, old bearings removed, new bearings installed.


Hi:  After reading this post about removing the bearings from the 1/2
shafts I have a question.  Is this procedure recomended by Porsche?  I
would worry about the shaft comming back to the same heat treat spec's
when it cools down, and if they are heating the bearing as it probably is
the part that needs to expand, that doesn't sound to good either.  Is the
bearing sealed.  It won't be for long.  I think they should just be
pressed off cold.  Usually parts like that have a few thousands press
fit.  And that is pretty easy if you have access to a press.   I would
like to hear some more on this subject in case mine ever go out.   
Thanks all
