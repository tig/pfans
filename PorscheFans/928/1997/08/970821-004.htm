  While installing a new electrical connector on the two wires to Temp 
  Sensor II, I noticed some electrical tape wrapped around the heat shrink
  wrap that bundles the wires.  The tape was starting to come loose, so I 
  pulled it off to rewrap it and noticed that a resistor had been spliced 
  into one of the wires.  I don't dissect my wiring harness very often, 
  but I'm pretty certain this wasn't a factory installation.
  
  The wires to Temp Sensor II are yellow and brown with the brown being
  a heavier gauge.  The resistor was faded pink with gold, orange, black,
  and red bands (I didn't get a chance to check the rating with a meter)
  and was spliced into the brown wire.
  
  Does anyone have any ideas on what problem the installer might have been
  trying to fix by putting in this resistor?   (The resistance values for
  my Temp Sensor II seem to be within spec when read directly off the sensor...)
