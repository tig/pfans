	Ohayo gozaimasu Phil,

If you read this after 10 o'clock AM, konichi wa, and if you're an
evening reader, konban wa.

It wasn't meant to offend.  This rimes you know;-);-).  I should have
put some smilies behind it.  But unfortunately the remark has been my
experience so far.  And regarding this, I work for a Japanese company
flooded with Japanese man and women (preferred by me;-);-);-);-);-)) and
visit Japan rather often.  Guess what company it is:-):-).  You're
probably right though, saying that all Japanese man are posers, it's to
strong.

But whats the importance of this discussion?  Or am I offending to many
people with soft skins at the moment;-);-);-);-);-);-);-);-);-);-)?
(Lots of smilies this time)

But as far as my English goes, its not my native language, a poser is a
"show off".  Therefore you do not need to be in a picture to be a poser.
 Do correct me if I'm wrong though.

But then again, aren't we all posers.  We buy a big rare, were not many
build and sold of the 928, sports car or rather sports limousine and
cruise or race around in it.  We go to special meetings to show off our
car.  A digest is created too, just for this car.  And yes, I'm also
proud and feel favoured to own a 928.


Sayanora, Leon
