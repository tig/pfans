 Once that is out of the way the valve cover gaskets are pretty easy to

change.  Don't remember how much of the bill was that but I would guess it

was more than $500.>>

I just had a 60K service & valve cover gasket change done on my 87 928S4 and
the bill was over $900, so I'd say that most of the cost was labor.  Well
worth it though!
