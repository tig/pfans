Problem with the vacuum sounds like a pretty good guess, and you're
right about the control valves and their location. If you take out
the parcel shelves (4 nuts each) then you can remove the side panels
of the center console and get some access inside there.

Here's something I wrote that might be relevant:

There is a servomotor that controls your heat, located above the
driver's right knee. You must remove the parcel shelf to get at it.
It has a little arm which controls the temperature mixer flap. If the
arm is all the way up, you get max heat; all the way down, no heat.
Normal position with the inside temperature stable is roughly
horizontal. So the first step is to find out what that little
arm is doing. With the parcel shelf out, you can feel its position
while sitting in the driver's seat. If it never stops anywhere
but all the way up or all the way down, you have isolated the
problem somewhat.

The key input to the servomotor is pin 4 of the upper plug (there are
two). It connects to the outside temp sensor(in the air duct to the
alternator), which connects to the inside temp sensor (behind the
slotted fitting in the dash next to the glove box), which connects
to a rheostat on the temperature control slider. According to the
manual, the resistance between pins 4 and 12 should be about
3.7Kohms with the slider at 18, and about 4.7 Kohms with the slider
at 30. I think that assumes approximately room temperature for
the sensors.

Now, if there is any break in the chain from outside temp
sensor to inside temp sensor to temperature control slider, you
will get the binary temperature problem.
So check that reading, if you're electrically inclined. If it's
wildly different, you've found the problem. If not, maybe you'll
be lucky and the connector just needed reseating.

This is important because the servomotor also controls the heater
valve, so if it's doing the wrong thing, so will the valve.
