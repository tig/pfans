I found myself in the same situation.

I always wanted to own a 928 in the end. It has always been my number one
car. I was intending to slowly work my way up, via other great cars such as
the BMW M3.

Then I did some research and found that here in New Zealand, the price of
2nd hand models had dropped considerably. This was due to the influx of
cheap imported 2nd hand cars we've had over the last few years when the
government freed up the importation controls and tariffs.

An '83 928S cost NZ$150,000 brand new. Mine (imported by a dealer from Hong
Kong) cost me NZ$28,000.

The GTS was ~NZ$240,000 new. That's my next target car!

Cheers,
