Yah - I heard the go-fast crowd automatically remove the assembly.
Jeez, I need some scanner time - you all are really going to like this
next crop of photos (very appropo to current subject).

Until then, a new tidbit:
Spotted in "the World's Strangest Automobiles" book ($8.99) at
PriceClub:  An all-silver factory Gullwing Widebody 928!!!  It's an '89
or better, I can see the computer readout in the console.  Wait a
minute, it's a non airbag car for sure.  Has Euro sidemarkers I guess
because the car was slated for the Japanese market (original buyer
defaulted though but book kinda' says it was sold finally).  Everything
is silver - or silver leather, silver painted, etc.  Only the shifter
console (an automatic) looks like burlwood.  Eight exhaust pipes
emanating from a rear valence opening.

Phil
