The other thing to check when calling about a loan, talk to someone who
knows what they are doing. 

The first time I called 2 separate banks, they both said they didn't loan
on any vehicle older than X years old. Period! (Bah!) Second time I called
and spoke to the manager (I was a little irate for the runaround), they
will loan on certain cars. The key was, the make PORSCHE! and mentioning
the value from CPI (Cars of Particular Interest) or other similiar
guides!?!  If they still won't deal with you, they have their head to far
up their... well, you know...

Personally I like the credit card (round-robin) idea. I just didn't want to
bother with a new card every 6 months or so. I'd end up forgetting...

Now I have my car (!) and a loan. :)  Currently she's in the shop with a
broken clutch pedal. Came off when driving to dinner for my (wedding)
anniversary. Concidence? I think not! ;)
