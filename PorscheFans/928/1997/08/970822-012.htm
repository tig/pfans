Sorry about the WOB, but just received and read  an article about =
Chrysler's Prowler in the September issue of Automobile magazine and =
came across a statement that flat-out boggles the mind for its =
stupidity.

The author, Eddie Alterman, is discussing the problems of constructing =
car bodies in aluminum, specifically problems with torsional and bending =
rigidity.  We've all heard the technical rationale for  avoiding =
aluminum in load-bearing members of the body structure (low modulus of =
elasticity, weak spot welds, blah, blah, blah), and Alterman tries to =
impress us by spouting off some odd-ball formula replete with Greek =
symbols.  Fine so far.  The author goes on to state the reason for =
low-resale value of the 928 was it's aluminum construction!

What?!!!

Specifically: "According to this equation, the 928, which is made of 19 =
percent aluminum, loses 17 percent of its rigidity - along with much of =
its appeal - after 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles)."  Yup, you read =
that right!

First, according to "Project 928", the car has exactly 89.3 pounds of =
aluminum in the engine lid, doors, and front fenders.  Since the car =
weighs between 3373 ('79) and 3600 ('95) lbs, I don't know where 17 =
percent aluminum came from.  Maybe a little less Greek symbology and a =
little more long division might help you calculate percentages, Eddie.

Second, since when are doors and engine lids structural?

Third, I guess Eddie's got scads of mail about disgruntled 928 owners =
swindled when they discovered their 170 mph GTs were as limp as day-old =
linguini.  "I swear, I was just driving along, and man, that aluminum =
front end got goosey on me and just flew off!  Damned near beaned an old =
lady on a bus bench."

Is it any wonder why 928 owners are so disgusted sometimes about all the =
disinformation.  Hell, I expect the next story will be "928 unintended =
deaccelleration, next on Hardcopy!"
