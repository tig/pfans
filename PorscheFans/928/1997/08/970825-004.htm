  Here's an old post from Phil Eskildsen...

Subject: Dashboard Removal

On May 7, Vince asked:

>>C'mon, I'm sure SOMEONE out there has removed a dash before!  My 
>>question is, do you need to remove the windshield first?

I have done R&R on dash and pod.  Unlike 911, the windshield does NOT
have to be removed first.

The porcedure is not difficult, just take it slow and easy.  The dash is
only held in by four bolts, but you have to remove a lot of stuff to get
to them. Steering wheel, Pod & instrument cluster, knee shelves, glove
box, a/c center vent, a/c control head, radio and clock, console and
seats all should be removed fro easier access.  Be very careful and look
for hidden bolts if things don't move easily or seem to hang.  I had
wonderful advice from an experienced Porsche 928 mechanic who had done
this many times and the benefit of the 9 vol. factory manual set.  The
friendly mechanic was more useful. I had to fabricate replacements for
some broken plastic tabs on the console that the PO broke while
installing a radio and I stripped the 5mm hex-cap-head bolts that hold
the steering column brackets. 

Rather than a full description, which I'm not sure I remember, I'll just
give a few hints.

  You should remove the seats for better access.  You will spend a lot
of time on your back with head under dash.

  A flourescent worklight will keep you cooler and less burnt.

  A 1/4" drive swivel-head socket drive bar is VERY useful. This is not
the same thing as the 360 degree swivel adapter found in every socket
set, but is a straight 1/4" drive non-ratcheting socket handle whose
head swivels 180 degrees.  3" and 5" extensions in 1/4" drive size will
prove useful. A yellow paint pen (available from art supply houses) is
useful in marking parts and positions and easier to see than nail
polish.

  The five knobs on the pod just pull off the pod switches. The switches
can be pulled forward by using two small screwdrivers to push the 'ears'
together and pry the switches out through the front.  Then the switches
can be unplugged from their connectors.  Mark everything. When you
reassemble the pod, you will never be able to get the plugs onto the
switches from the rear.  You will need to pull the cables and plug ends
through the holes in the pod, then attach and seat the switches.

  The instrument cluster has three edge-card connectors.  Mark polarity
before removing.

  The cluster and pod is held in place by two long (about 3" & 5") 5mm
hex-cap-head bolts.  The shorter of these goes into an excentric offset
bolt that holds and centers the cluster in the pod and the pod in its
dash openning.  If you elect to seperate pod and cluster (i.e to replace
or recover a cracked cluster cover), mark the position of this offeset
bolt.

  If something doesn't come out easily or hangs, look for a hidden
bolt.  I remember one inside the center a/c vent (pry out vent with
spatula), one indide the glovebox, and two at each rear edge of the
console (broken tabs).

  FWIW, I paid $150 to a local auto upholstery shop (King Kover,
Oakland, CA) to have my dash and glovebox lid recovered in vinyl.  The
shop that did my work had to use a stretchy vinyl but even matched the
Porsche style of stichery on the seams.  My only regret was in not
insisting on and getting an exact color and texture match between vinyl
and leather.  This could have been done by dying the vinyl to match the
leather.  I was more worried about eventual cracking or flaking of the
dye (essentially an acrylic paint) than the mismatch in color.
