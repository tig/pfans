On its return, whenever the engine is idling (and the engine is warm), the
centre console and dash warning lights flash. Pushing the cancle button
does nothing, but as soon as you hit about 10MPH, the lights extinguish and
everything is just peachy. It's been doing this for nearly a year now. Oil
pressure is fine. It doesn't bother me, I just ignore the flashing, but it
bugs the hell out of my fiance.>>>>>

Sounds to me like you have a bad oil pressure sensor/sender.  Mine did the
same thing and after a change of the sending unit the problem was gone!
 Check it out to see.  Which warning light (on the dash) is coming on besides
the exclamation point on the center console?
