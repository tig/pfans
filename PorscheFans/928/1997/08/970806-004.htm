Sounds like a great idea. Wanted to throw my 2 cents in though.

We do alot of  "traditional" advertising for our web based customers, and
recently had 47 black t-shirts printed up for a customer. 

They were 3 color shirts, and ended up costing only $15.00 a piece.

The quality of the shirts were excellent, and we have used this printer on
several occasions now.

That is an *excellent* price, and due to the volume of business that we
give them,
probably could not be reproduced by most others.

If you guys don't have any luck with finding reasonably priced printers,
let me know, and we can take care of it.

Thanks,


Larry Flaxman
