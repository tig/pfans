<< My advise to you is to take the GT to the nearest Porsche Dealership for
an
 estimate. This will most likely be a lot higher than the body shop. You
could
 then demand that it be repaired by Porsche only, and if it is her fault the
 insurance company will have to pay it all.  At least this will give you some
 leverage in negotiating with her Insurance company.
 Be firm and remember, she is at fault and her insurance company has to pay.
 Don't take any crap from them. >>
David,
   I went to a dealership near me,(Jack Daniels), and they said for me to go
to a body shop about 20 minutes away. Should the dealer have there own body
shop etc.. If so I wil take it to the nearest one that has that.  Also, I am
noticing when I am shifting I hear somthing grinding. Are the engine belts,
toothed belts in the front of the engine? Because I fear that they may be
mised aligned and the cams and pistons are grinding. I will take it to my
machanic anyway, he's a Aourthized Porsche machinic.

will let you know,

matt
