Sounds to me like FOLINO might benefit from a new service provider.  Throw
out where you live, and hopefully some of the others on the list will throw
some suggestions (or better yet WHO TO AVOID) your way.

By the way, I live in Phoenix Arizona and have had good experiences with
Beck's Porsche Shop.  I've stayed late into the evening, way past closing
time, talking with the owner and his son about Porshes.  Also, they're the
ones mentioned in the local auto trader by name a lot ("Transmission rebuilt
by Beck's") in hopes of increasing value.  I'd be interested in hearing of
other service providers in my area, since Beck's doesn't do upholstery,
body/paint, etc.

thanks!

SECOND WHEN I TAKE OFF FROM A STOP POSITION THE CAR WILL ACCELERATE UP TO
4,000 RPM AND THEN SWITCH GEARS, HOWEVER, IF
I AM IN MOTION AND TRY TO ACCELERATE IT WILL HESITATE THEN SLOWLY
GAIN SPEED. THIS HAPPENS WHEN I PUNCH THE PEDAL AND WHEN I TRY TO 
SLOWLY PUSH THE PEDAL DOWN. I WENT TO SEVERAL MECHANICS WHO TELL ME THIS IS
NORMAL .  I DON'T REMEMBER MY OLD TRANI DOING THE SAME THING. ( TRANI
REPLACED A YEAR AGO)
