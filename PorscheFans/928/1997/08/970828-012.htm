This is my first post so be kind.

I live in Vermont and bought my first Porsche 79 928 US 5 speed silver
metallic about a year and a half ago. The car wasn't a toilet when I bought
it but it was cosmetically rough. I have replaced the rack, smog pump (to
get the fan belt tensioner back), exhaust (ANSA Eurospec), Dunlop D40M2's,
heater control unit, rebuilt the emergency brake, rear rotors, had the
front seats re-upholstered (expensive), done all the tune up stuff and now
have a sound car. This thing carves turns like an expensive giant slalom
ski. This winter I will deal with paint and clutch chatter ($$$).

Alot of the postings I have been reading are talking about Eurofying 78,79
& 80 model year cars. I assume that means horsepower approaching 300 and
suspension and brake enhancements. What is a prioritized list of things
that I can do to achieve Eurofication? A Porsche mechanic suggested an S4
brake conversion and gave me a parts list? Should that be first or last? He
also gave me some suggestions for getting more horsepower (torque) by
eliminating or changing engine accessories. Can anyone help put me on the
right track?

Thanks in advance,

jkempf@fabtechinc.com

ps...I have an awesome source for parts in Massachusetts if anyone is
interested. This guy saved me so much money I may have to declare him as a
dependant (example: low mileage S4 rack $225).
