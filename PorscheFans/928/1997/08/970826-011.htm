I am buying the wing from Alan NG. You can see what it looks like on the
photo on the 928svr web site.
I wont be leaving the S-Spoiler on like Alan did, My S-Spoiler is an
aftermarket item anyway as my car is a 78'.

In the photo - it looks to me as if the wing is too high. Obviously if it
is placed high it is because the s-spoiler is still on the car. As I am
getting the entire car painted (Silver pearl if you must know) - I can
have my body guy attach the spoiler wherever it needs to be.

I wont lie to you - the first and foremost concern for me when i decided
to buy the wing was cosmetics. however now that i have the wing I feel I
should put it in the correct place so that It is functional. I would be
interested in any opinions on this as I have very little knowledge of
aerodynamics, and am unable to find on the WEB pictures of stroseks
intentions as to the location of this wing on the rear hatch.
