	Hi ya all,

I've been reading this digest for some time now and already some
interesting information has past me by.

I was wondering if there is someone out there who might be able to help
me with 2 minor problems I have with the electrical installation of my
91 GT.

Instrument console:
There is a sensor in there which, if I'm correct, should activate the
instrument console lights as soon as it gets darker in the car, e.g.
through a tunnel, etc.  Mine though is always on.  Did anyone have this
problem too, and did you find a solution for it, and if so what
solution?  I've checked the schematics but there nothing mentioned in
there.  The instrument console is apparently one unit.

Chair settings memory switches:
The switches work properly, the lights in them don't work at all.  I've
checked the switch itself for the lights in there. It contains 3 yellow
LED's and 1 normal small light bulb.  The wiring in there is incredibly
strange though, not logical at all, said in a Spocky tone of
voice;-);-).  The last one was broken, the LED's do work properly.  I've
replaced the light bulb in it for a 3V one, but I do not know if this is
the correct voltage, it still does not work though.  All the connections
though disappear in one unit in the car.  I can't believe that this unit
is broken since everything works OK, if one light wouldn't work, I could
except this unit to be broken, but all 4 of them.  If that's the case,
Murphy would have had as great day though;-);-).    Did anyone have this
problem too, and did you find a solution for it, and if so what
solution?

I know they are minor problems but well, they just annoy me.  And
anyway, the more lights the better, as long as it doesn't become a
christmas tree though.

Thanks in advance all, for your great help.

All the best,

Leon
