That five to ten second timing sounds too consistent to be a
coincidence, don't you think? Plus the fact that you run at the
fan speed with the most heat produced in the resistors. The
only other thing on my car which could run the fan at high
speed is the defrost relay, barring crossed wire sorts of
problems; the only thing that relay does is run the interior fan
at high speed, so I pulled it out. Of course the problem
went away just long enough to make me think I had found the
solution before it recurred.

Now, your wiring is a bit different from mine, but is it possible
that the current drawn to run the cooling fans, which must be
considerable, changes conditions enough to cause the thermostatic
protector to activate?
