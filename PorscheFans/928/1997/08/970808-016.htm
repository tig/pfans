My 928 needs a good home!

'83 928S
93,000 miles
metallic gray (repainted from burgundy by PO)

This car runs excellent.  Interior is good except for the front seat, which
the leather is cracked and the dash and 'pod, which have a crappy
"cover-lays" over them (by one of the POs).  I bought the car in the
spring, but no longer have the space for it.  It has a few other cosmetic
problems and will probably need new rear shocks soon (red Konis, $190/ea or
less).  The PO replaced the timing belt and the clutch last November at 89k
miles.  Since I've owned it, I've replaced the alternator, power steering
hose, plus all filters, etc.  Most systems, including the A/C work good. 
The 1-2 synchros are a little worn, but the car is still very drivable and
I think the tranny has quite a few tens of thousands of miles left on it. 
This car would make a good project car, or for use as is.  I need to sell
it fast as I no longer have a place to keep it (don't want to park it on
the street in my town)  $5500, firm.  I am located just outside of New York
City, convenient to the tri-state area.
