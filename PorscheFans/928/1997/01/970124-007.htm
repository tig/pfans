 Hi all,
 I have a question concerning the heat in my '87 928S4 (or the lack thereof).
 The heat did not appear to work when I bought it, but wasn't a large concern
 as I didn't intend to drive the car in winters anyway. After further thought
 I decided it would be nice to have heat for those rare dry winter days during
 which the car would be nice to take out.
 Anyway, I was hoping to work on the heating system sometime in the not too
 distant future (have perused the shop manuals and it looks like a potentially
 hideous process) and I would sure appreciate it if anyone could give me
 some ideas as to probable culprits. Maybe the heat valve? Would be nice, as
 the part is only about $24. Inside or outside sensor?
 Thanks for the help in advance!!!
 
 David
