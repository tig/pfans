I'm sure you will get lots of good advice on the main part of your question.

As for the last point, I can give you the answer, but you won't like it.

Factory front bumper cover           $650, used
Factory front spoiler                        $500 new
lights & turn signal assemblies   $1000 new

Body work: cut front bumper to fit later lights 1.5 hours. Cut and bend
front fenders to fit S4 cover: 5 hours. (alternatively, you can sell your
early fenders and buy S4 fenders--probably $800 net cost) Paint (varies)

Factory rear bumper cover              $450 used
Factory bumperettes                         $150 used
Factory bumper (bar)                        $200 used
Factory rear light assemblies          $500 new
Modify rear sheetmetal to accomodate larger lights: 7 hours cut and bend
rear quarters to fit S4 cover: 5 hours. Paint (varies)

Add to this a couple hundred bucks for new beading, and you can see, this
is pricey. I managed to do it for $2,500 or so (you can see my car at
http://www.auburn.edu/~garnecs/928.html), but would not recommend it for an
otherwise-unmodified car.

There are a couple of aftermarket alternatives. AIR (euuugh) makes an 'S4'
style nose and tail that uses the same edges of the old-style bumper
covers, and IFC makes a better setup that they have recently cut prices on.
This gives you the 'S4 look' for about $600 for the 'glass, but you still
have to buy the light assemblies.

Best bet: if you want this look without the cost of a real S4, get one the
P.O. has modified. Several are usually listed at  the Porsche Classifieds
site http://www.best.com/~dem/pcd/pcd_main.htm

Good luck.
