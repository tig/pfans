Looking for ideas.....just arrived in Atlanta this evening with my fully
loaded 82 928, only to find that I couldn't open the rear deck; either the
small or large key turns easily to the left, small key turns to the right
but won't unlock, large key doesn't want to turn to the right without
binding--neither key seems to have any affect on the locking mechanism.
(I've been using only the small key since my alarm system started giving
random alerts)  It is a royal pain to unload a really packed 928 using only
the doors, but I have just proven that it can be done; now the question
is--anyone have any idea what the fix might be?  I don't have the inside
deck lid release, so the key is the only way....looking for suggestions,
prior to consulting the local mechanics.  (The load was not so full that I
had to force the lid closed)

Thanks for any ideas;
