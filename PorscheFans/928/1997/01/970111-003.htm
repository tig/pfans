Can't help with the 944 part, but my insurance runs about equal with a 91
leasure van that we own, and is just a tad more than my 86 300z. 
As far as maintence, find a good mechanic and be prepared for some hefty
parts prices. I had my alternator rebilt after getting quotes on a new one. I
did most of the repair work myself and found it to be a very easy car to work
on. I got most of my parts mail order and was very impressed with the number
of supply houses out there.
Unfortunally, a fairly minor rear end accident caused me to total the car
recently. The body parts were simply more valuable than the car.
good luck
