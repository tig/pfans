After reading Leonard Laub's e-mail on his purchase of wheels from Robert Wood
at Wheel Enhancement Inc., I decided to bite the bullet and give him a call.
The reason I was hesitant started three years ago when I bought my '79 928, 
which had the stock phone-dials all around.  I bought a set of track wheels
from one of our list members (Hi Steve!) and was happy, but I wanted
something different for the street.  I saw an ad in Pano for Robert Wood Wheels
and talked with one of the sales persons there.  I told him I wanted a 
to replace one of my wheels (a C2 wheel) with an '88 944 phone dial (same 
dimensions).  He said sure.  I asked him if we could trade the wheels.  He
said sure, plus $200.00.  I asked him how much the wheel alone would cost.  
He said, "250".  I said, "I'll have to think about it".  And I did.  A couple 
of days later, I said to myself, "Why not?"  I didn't need the C2 wheel anyway 
and called them back.  Well, the price of the wheel had changed, up to "275", 
and the trade was no longer offered.  I asked the sales person (a different
person from the previous guy) if he'd like to buy back my old wheels.  He said,
"Sure.  25 a piece; including the C2 for 25".  I felt stung.  I said I'd
have to think about it again and that I'd call him back.  I never did.  He
also offered to buy my track wheels, which were slightly bent, for the same
price.  I didn't realize it at the time but why would a wheel store buy back
bent wheels?

There were things I could have done better, among them, I should not
have been so cheap as to expect them to WANT my C2 wheel, my stock wheels or
my track wheels for more than they offered.  I also should have remembered
the first guy's name and contacted him the second time, but I didn't.  I also
posted my experience on p-philes and promptly got blasted by three members,
while two other members related their own sad stories to me about Robert Wood
Inc.

So now I call up Wheel Enhancement and talk with some guy about wheels for
my Pig.  He tells me about a set he has that'll fit perfectly on my car
and gives me a price.  I talk with him some more and find out it is THE 
Robert Wood;  so I tell him of my experience with his lame company a year or
two ago, thinking that he is still associated with Robert Wood, Inc.  He is
not and has not been since Feb. of '92.  I also find out he's back in 
business at his new company Wheel Enhancement to help out people who have
Porsche wheel needs.  It seems when he sold the company in Feb of 1992 (I
took notes during our conversation) he sold his name, and people are still
thinking that he is associated with that company.  He is not.  Also, I told
him I'd need a couple of days to come up with funding for the wheels.  His
response? "I'll hold them for you".

Anyway, I just wanted to relay some facts about Porsche wheel companies in 
the L.A. area.  I have no affiliation with either company; I am a satisfied
customer at Wheel Enhancement.

Here's the address and phone number in case anyone needs it:

Wheel Enhancement
(ask for Robert Wood)
10129 W. Jefferson
L.A., CA 
(310)836-8908

later,
bill
'79 928 ("stock")
