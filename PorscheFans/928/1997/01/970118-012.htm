Hi Mat:

Devek brought their header-equipped S4 to the dyno today... In all the
excitement, I forgot to ask if I could post the results but will say the
car was measured on a MUCH  higher scale than mine!  It also recorded
the highest torque and horsepower figures of the cars tested today.

For kicks I brought a dB meter and measured from the front of the S4
car, at an elevated position (atop some stairs), approximately 25 feet
from the car.  Idle fluctuated (due to boominess & resonance of indoor
facility, etc.) between 92 - 96 dB.  WFO throttle hit 120 dB for a bit
and also flutctuated as high as 124 dB.  I am not a sound technician and
your results may vary.  

Listening without ear muffs, the car is very healthy sounding and
obviously muscular.  I think it's running a Borla but not sure.  For
sure it's a 2-into-1 after the headers.  This car hauls!  

While we were there, I got a chance to take a test ride in a
custom-FlowMaster equipped '78 Euro 928.  Idle sound was similar to a
stock 928 inside, the owner stated it's much louder outside.  It was
fairly muted running hard through the gears so this is a good choice if
you don't want to attrach too much attention.  No dyno runs were made on
this car.

My bypass pipe didn't show up today either :(
Phil '84 928S
