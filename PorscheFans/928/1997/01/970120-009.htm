When I was a car crazed teen (I haven't changed much I guess), dyno runs
were only for Detroit and big time racing stars like Don Garlits (am I
dating myself).  Besides, where the hell was a dyno in Hawaii and who
could afford the shop time anyways?  Now of course is a different story,
with dyno shops popping up all around (California at least).  Our runs
on Saturday were performed at Superior Dyno Service in Fairfield, CA. 
Here's what it was like:

First up was my car.  I was directed to back into the garage and on top
of a full-car lift.  Once elevated, I backed the rear tires up onto the
dyno drum wheels - they were about four feet in diameter, three feet
wide each.  Looking at them from ground level I  questioned if my car
could even turn them.  Sensors were attached to the engine, a fan placed
in front of the grill and one under the car toward the trans, and the
car strapped down front and rear.

I was given instructions to leave the car in "3" (recall A/T) and not to
touch the brakes for any reason whatsoever!  With the temp gauge at the
halfway mark we started the first run...

"Bring the car up to 25 - 30 mph. When I signal, put your foot IN IT! 
When you hit 6,000 in top gear cut the throttle!"  Here goes nothing.  I
thought about each of the 144,000 miles this car has gone already and if
there was ever a way to go out this was it on the dyno giving it's
100%.  Thought about the Castrol GT commercial with a sputtering dying
engine.  Glad I just put in fresh Castrol 5/50wt synthetic, must thank
Leonard for getting me to change oil.

Ok.  Squeeze the gas, revs build.  Speedo didn't budge but then "boink"
it jumps to 20 and my heart starts racing.  22, 23, 24, 25 there's the
signal FLOOR IT!  BWAAHHHH - Watch the tach rise toward 6,000 and "whap"
the car bolts within the straps for the auto upshift to 3rd.  Still
reving, 4,000  5,000  hear a little strain  5,500 56 57 58 59 6 glance
at the speedo it says 140! I hold it just one beat further, then cut off
throttle!  

WHIRRRRRRRRrrrrrr the engine winds down, the tires wind down, the dyno
is making an awful loud noise as it winds down all in unison for what
seems like three minutes. Burbling idle and I feel like I'm in a dream,
especially as I'm sitting six feet off the ground and just went full
throttle to nowhere... My mind switches to imagining Scott Clapper
roaring down the 1320 in Florida in his 928S.   You just gotta' love
these cars!
