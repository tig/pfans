	I cut it about 1/8 inch in front (toward shifter) and 1/8 inch behind the row 
of switches. I was afraid at first, but after trying several types of glue 
with no luck, I realized that I would either replace it or get it recovered 
eventually. The window motors are over $300.00 each (dealer price) and the 
vinyl looked like crap, being curled up around the switch, so I decided what 
the heck. So far not one person has noticed. The foam under the vinyl is very 
thin and it is light in color, so I made it black with a magic marker. It 
looks good enough to realize that replacing the console would be foolish, 
unless I find one for almost nothing. Anyway, with my luck  I'd replace it and 
the new one would curl up in a year or two. 
	
	When you replaced yuor switch did you check for power at the solder 
terminals? Then check at the motor connector? That's how I found out about the 
thermal protection device. It is mounted on the white plastic base of the 
motor, on the inside. It looks like something out of an amplifier, but it"s 
just a set of contact points covered in a tiny plastic shell. Mine said "made 
in Britian" (it figures).

	Keep on autocrossing!
