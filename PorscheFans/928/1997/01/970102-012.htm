Hi everyone!

I'm in need of some advice and hope one or more of you have either heard
about a problem similar to mine or maybe have experienced it yourself.

I have an '84 928S.  The climate control unit fried itself last summer when
I turned on the a/c.  After I took it apart, I found that a circuit board
trace had actually burned away and a small relay on the back of the board
had fused.  Well, I fixed the circuit board and the relay, and everything
ran fine (for awhile).  Then a few months ago it fried again.  

I figured (hoped, really) that the cause was something malfunctioning within
the climate control unit, so I replaced it with a new one from Eurasian
Parts Select ($340).  It worked fine (I thought).  Well, I had to use the
a/c to defog the windshield last week and got that burning smell again
(darned near broke my finger, turning off that a/c as fast as I could!).

Now, what's causing this?  I went through the schematics in the maintenance
manuals and appartently the only things downstream from the burning circuit
board are a few cut off switches (to turn off the compressor if it ices,
etc) and then, finally, at the tail end of the electrical circuit, is the
compressor.

Here's my question:  could the magnetic clutch (which is enabled when the
a/c switch is pushed) be working (because my a/c blows cold) but drawing
*way* too much amps, which causes the circuit board to fry?  If so, can it
be fixed or am I looking at a new compressor?

I have no idea how to test this without putting an ammeter in the circuit.
If I go to Porsche they'll spend a bunch of *my* money to figure it out and
then they'll probably just guess that the compressor has to be replaced.  My
normal mechanic (who is really great, by the way), is not eager to jump into
this problem.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!!!

Thanks in advance.
