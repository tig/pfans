I have a 89 928 GT manual with 80K miles on it. It ran great all the 
way up until I sent it to Devek for them to make every mod that they 
have. I thought it was fast before, but you should see it now. On the 
Dyno it is doing 400 foot pounds of torque and 350 horses. This is at 
the tires, not the engine! Add about 20% to that for engine power. 
Now more to your question. There is not much of a difference between 
the GT and a GTS so the parts should not be that different. It it 
does have different external mirrors, a different rear end and about 
35 more horses then a stock GT. Also a GTS is about $15,000 or more 
in price then a GT in the used market. Since they are almost the same 
car as my 89, it should drive the same, GREAT. I drive it every day 
in southern California, not much rain and no snow, with not one major 
problem. I also have a very heavy foot :-). My two cents.

I would say unless you're used to driving Ferraris, the performance 
would be pretty amazing to most people.  Under 5 seconds 0-60 is
my guess if the automatic makes it in 5.4 as someone claimed.
     
The cost of ownership must be high.  I have a S4, which is a 
step or two down from the GTS and I've probably spent $3000 on it in 
a little less than two years (might be a little more than that if I
think about it - but who wants to think about that?! ;), not including 
gas and tires.  I did some stuff myself also.
     
But since the GTS is newer, this may not be the case yet, as my car is 
around 10 years old.
     
Also consider that there were a limited number of GTSs made in the world 
(in the hundreds I believe, anyone know the exact number?) so this makes 
parts inherently higher.  The low number of cars shipped (less than 100 
in 95 in the US is what I read) was one reason the 928 was discontinued. 
It's a shame though - maybe with more marketing/push from Porsche we 
could have had the 6 liter 400 hp Devek car made at the factory today - 
with a 6 spd maybe?!   I can only dream ;)
