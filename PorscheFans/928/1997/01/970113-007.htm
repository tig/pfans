I had similar problems with an '86 928s with a good battery.  Explanation
given to me by Holbert's was the priority in ladder diagram with electronic
ignition.
My problem was very slight white corrosion under battery ground strap at
frame.  % minutes with a crocus cloth solved it. I needed a tow , of course.

Explanation was..1st priority is to starter motor to crank. 2nd is to fuel
pump.  Final is to electronics to trigger ignition.  It is voltage not
amperage sensisitve so cranking can be fine but slight reistance will change
voltage.  Once car fires its is not a problem.  The voltage is needed to
trigger.  Problem with excessive craning can be flooding cylinders with fuel.
 I was told if car cranks and fails to catch or stalls after first catching
to open throttle wide to prevent flooding and try again.  This is contrary
tto normal fuel injection starting procedure.  I haven't had the repeat
problem in 7 years.  Car was purchase used with 17k miles in 1989.
