Getting lots of replies - hope to see you all there!    Gordon Biersch is
in the big red brick building that used to be Hill Bros Coffee (see the big
red neon letters?).  It is right on the waterfront, practically under the
Bay Bridge.  

The plan on parking is to park at the lot on Folsom St. between The
Embarcadero & Spear Street.  It's not enclosed but is attended (at least it
was tonight!).  Parking is $3.00 (at least it was tonight!) a deal for the
city!  Bring your car covers if you have 'em for while the cars are
parked...

If the night is clear (at least it was tonight!) we'll  have some excellent
photo opportunities later ie. the Embarcadero 1- 4 still have the full
building Xmas lights, the Bay Bridge always has the span lights on, etc. 
The full gamut of 928 cars are on the way!  

Here's my best try at an ASCII map:
