God is pissed, so she calls a meeting.  Invited to this meeting are Bill
Clinton, Boris Yeltsin & Bill Gates.

"Boys," she says, "I've had it.  The world will end on January 1st.  That's
it, get out of here."

Bill Clinton goes on national television and announces, "My fellow
Americans, I have some good news and I have some bad news.  The good news is
that Bob Dole will not be your president.  The bad news is that the world
will end on January 1st.  Good luck.  Deal with it."

Boris Yeltsin addresses the Russian people.  "People of Russia," he says, "I
have some bad news and some even more bad news.  First, the world will end
on January 1st.  The other bad news; there really IS a god!"

Returning to Redmond, Washington, Bill Gates goes on worldwide live
teleconferencing to the collected employees of Microsoft, Inc. and says, "I
have some good news and some even more good news.  First, god herself has
told me that I am one of the three most important people in the world.
Second, we won't have to fix the bugs in Windows '95 after all."

Now, can we PLEASE get back to 928s?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Is the paint on a 928 clearcoat (or, if not, what?)?  Are the bumper caps
painted or is the color impregnated in the plastic?  What is the best way to
restore the color to bumper caps that have faded slightly?  Has anyone had
experience with professional steam cleaning of the engine compartment and
undercarriage?  What, if any, undercoating or treatment did Porsche use?
Will steam cleaning remove this?  If yes, what is the best way to restore
this protection?  Is there any US equivalent of the UK's "Waxoyl"
undersealing wax?  This is not a big worry here in Tucson, anyway... our
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base is the home of the famous airplane graveyard.
Besides, I got a 928 vs. a 914 in part because the galvanized steel &
aluminum Porkers never seem to rust  ;)
