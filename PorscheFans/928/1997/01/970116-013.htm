          I have never needed a spare in my life, without needing a tow truck. 
However, I can still fit my spare in my car if I do feel the need. I bought my 
car in Los Angeles, last year, with the rims & the CD player, but the install 
I did over the summer. The PO flew me down there to look at it and I talked 
him down from 26K  to 19.5K.  I looked agressively for over 6 months and saw 
only 1 other black 5sp and it sold for 24K in three days!

	My enclosure weighs about 50 lbs. or so. I also have one with 3-8" JL Audo's 
in it which would sound (pound) much better (with attached Phoenix Gold amp)  
but I'm too lazy to switch them.

	Please do, sounds interesting!
