(In spirit of the Internet and the Porschefan list server...
I copied this to the 928 mailgroup)

Jim, I found the pump/filter cavity, and pulled off the cover -- great 
description, thanks!!

I didn't have time tonight to complete a filter swap, I'll finish 
tomorrow.  Question:  after breaking open the filter line, the amount of 
fuel I should expect to drop out is only that contained in the filter 
and line... right?  In other words, the tank will not start draining out 
the open line... right?

I'm guessing since the filter is inline with the pump, the (inactive) 
pump serves as a plug on the segment of (opened) line for the filter.

While you're on the line, a few more questions if you don't mind.  I 
bought the `88 928 S4 as a pleasure car only a month ago.  Its in pretty 
good condition -- only 32K miles, but I'm striving to restore in near 
perfect condition.  The questions:

* I priced the Porsche shop manual(s) for the 928... ~$300 for the 
  4 volume set!!!  A little more than I wanted to spend.  Is there a
  3rd party (how-to) maintenance manual for the 928 that you have 
  found useful?

* Any tricks/tips for pulling the spark plugs?  I've detailed under the
  hood, but haven't seriously tried getting to anything yet.  The plug
  wires appear to go deep into the valve covers -- just a hard yank on
  the boots to expose the plugs?

* Have any experience replacing the sunroof gasket?  Mine needs
  replacing; I've now got the parts and time; but Porsche shop guy 
  tells me its a real bear to do.  I generally want to do as much 
  myself as possible, but can't buy every specialized tool in the
  world.  Just curious if you might have done this.

thanks,
dw
