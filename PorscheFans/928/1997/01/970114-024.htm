After my car sits for a day or so I experience the following problems.  If I
start the car when it is cold with the clutch depressed and move the gear
shifter from gear to gear or into reverse everything is fine and smooth.
Once I have let the clutch up, then depress it again the problem occurs.
The shifter will not go into any of the gears smoothly and grinds very hard
into reverse.  It really feels like the clutch is not disengaging the
propshaft from the engine.  However, if I drive the car (yes it is a very
bad Idea)  and work the clutch a little it gets smooth and seems to have no
problems going  into any of the gears like any other properly working car.
It really works just fine after driving the car for 10 minutes.  It has been
down in the low 30s here the last couple times it did this.  The clutch was
replaced within the last 20K miles.  Could it be that one of the hydraulic
cylinders is bleeding down, like brakes do after sitting?  How long will the
propshaft continue to spin after the clutch has been depressed?  The trans
was also rebuilt about 8K miles ago.  Could the trans be that stiff and
tight when cold that the once the propshaft gets spinning it will grind when
put into reverse, even after letting it sit with the clutch depressed for
some time.  Any ideas, other than taking it to the nearest Porsche mechanic,
would be very helpful.  

Thanks
