Price doesn't seem unreasonable to me, if it's in that good shape, but
then I what do I know? The leather interior being in good shape is not
that usual, so you may have found a good one.

May I strongly recommend that you take it to Ed Almeida, the proprietor
of Precision Performance Repair in Framingham, (508)872-3708, for an
evaluation. He does the 928 Tech Sessions for the NE Region of the PCA,
he loves 928s, and he can give a good assessment of what the car is
likely to need. It's just a dinky little shop, but he has done good
work for me and I think he is quite trustworthy.

One note - this list has heard of at least two cases where the aluminum
ball joint failed, fortunately at low speed. That part was changed
to steel in late '83, and it looks like it should be retrofitted to
older cars, even though it was never an official recall. You could
check with a magnet to see if the outermost piece of the lower front
control arms are aluminum or steel.

Good luck with your new toy!
