Other than the PS pump problem, sounds like it was a nice trip!
I LOVE taking mine on long trips.  I'm getting withdrawals
because it's been off the road for a month and a half now and
I just started some winter fixups last weekend.

From what I've heard, the oil in the intake is actually OK -
it sucks it through on the 32 valvers when revved up.  It worried
me too when I saw oil in there the first time because I thought
immediately of blow-by problems in the rings and/or valves.

I think there are POTENTIAL problems if you plan to race 
or spend significant time around the redline, with detonation
due to the oil fouling things up in the combustion chamber. 
I don't think it's a concern for most of us.

Read more about it in the Devek catalog (but not too much, you
can drive yourself nuts worrying about every possible thing).
That's where I read about the possible detonation for high RPM 
driving.  There is a fix for that also in there - some kind of 
baffle that gets installed inside the block (forget that as
far as I'm concerned!) Also, the use of Redline oil supposedly helps.

In the service and owner's manuals, a relatively large 
consumption of oil is considered normal, maybe due to this 
tendency of the engine.  I believe they claim up to 1L/1000km 
or about 1 qt per 600 miles is within spec!  Mine has never 
really used more than about a pint per 2000 miles but maybe 
that's because I don't rev it enough (got the automatic - oh well).

Don't know the fix for H4 lights.  Got the big H5s myself (stock ;).
