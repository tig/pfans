Hi all:

As promised here's an open invitation to all PFans who'll be in the SF area
this friday to stop by Gordon Biersch Brewery for some suds & garlic fries!
 GB is located under the Bay Bridge at the corner of Harrison & The
Embarcadero (which runs the length of the Wharf).  This is an informal,
no-host get together that started with two 928's and a 911 Cabrio owner and
now who knows?  There is on-street parking, as well as inside parking
around the corner (dishonest list lurkers beware these very commited Pcar
owners!)

We start around 6pm, and try to score a *table* outside since the patio is
heated and the views are excellent, plus some do enjoy sampling & sharing
their favorite cigars.  Always a good idea to munch on GB's great garlic
fries!  

Though not a Porsche-owner only type of thing, I will try to get those that
do to wear some paraphenalia (sic?) so we can figure out who's where! 
Heck, anything'll do - pit pass, cap?  (I should be easy to find as the
short Asian 'dude' in jeans, chain smoking - coff cough, swig of amber...)

Hope to meet some of you there!  Email me for further details, etc.

Phil '84 928S
