There are a number of other hoses in that system also.

A common one that cracks is the one on the passengar side near the front - 
I don't know if it's the same on an 86.  This hose was really brittle on 
my 87 when I replaced it I think because it kind of rests on the head 
which gets hot during normal operation.  This was the only hose that 
was in stock at the two dealers I checked with when I replaced the breather 
hoses last year so I presume it must be a common item.  This also plugs
into that oil filler area in the "V" reservoir.

You may want to check that if the oil mess isn't fixed by the T hose.

You may want to clean out the "V" also - a dirty engine will run a
little hotter and be unpleasant to work on.  When I cleaned mine out 
there were leaves, a few hose clamps and several washers down in 
there.
