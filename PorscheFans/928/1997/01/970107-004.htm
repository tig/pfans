Well, gentle souls, I've gone and done it... I found - and bought - my 928.
I had been looking at 1980-84 5-speeds for around $10k, but I couldn't find
one in pristine condition.  This despite the wonderful Porsche Classifieds
Digest on the internet.  (How come most Porsche Market Letter advertisers
don't use the allowable space... hard to shop, let alone get excited, if
they don't list condition, transmission, etc.)  What I ended up with, after
a roughly 3 month search, is a Guards Red/Black leather late 1986 5-speed,
complete with the 288hp 4cam/32 valve engine, S4 ABS brakes & S4 struts,
plus Alpine cassette, new Porsche crest mats & Dunlop D40's, quality
sheepskins & built-in remote radar detector.  Price $13,500.  For all
intents and purposes, this is a one-owner car, Porsche-dealer serviced,
always garaged and detailed monthly.  The fellow I bought it from (a
30-something software engineer in Stirling, VA/suburban Washington) had
owned it only two months, after a similarly comprehensive search, before the
wife brought baby number 2 back to the newly-mortgaged ("mort" = "death",
"gage" = "pledge"... think about it!) house and announced that she'd changed
her mind and wouldn't be going back to work after all.  Oops...  So the '74
2.7L RS replica went, then the 928.  He saw my "wanted" listing on the
internet the day he went to post the ad.  He's keeping the 914, and will buy
a clean but non-running signal orange chassis in Colorado to blend up one
pristine car.  Love that signal orange!  Luckily, this true member of "the
brotherhood" will not be banished to minivan hell.

Well, back to Tucson in 3 days with my first Porsche.  A 2,200 mile dash
will tell you alot about a 94,000 mile car.  One pleasant surprise is that
the water temp gauge bulb began working on its own accord mid trip.  The
seats are extraordinarily comfortable except for the left side bolster which
just catches my shoulder blade.  The rear height adjuster doesn't work, but
I'd run it where it is (lowest position) anyways.  Neither the regular or
intensive windshield washers work, nor does the right front driving lamp.
Otherwise, everything is A+: mirrors, windows, seats, sunroof, rear wiper,
hood & hatch releases all work; no (zero, zilch, nada) dash cracks and
superb leather and carpeting.  Silent and smooth brakes.  The biggest - and
most pleasant! - surprise was the vast improvement in shift quality brought
by the 1985 & later switch from Porsche to Borg-Warner synchronizers.  No
graunch, no hunting (once the tranny oil is warmed up).  Tight clutch with
plenty of bite and feel.  I can't wait until August, when I'll find out if
the optional rear air-conditioner can help the 928 deal with Tucson's 116
degree summer heat.

Very few problems so far.  The steering is a trifle heavier than the other
928's I've driven, so I'll be checking out the power steering pump, belt,
fluid and lines.  My "belt tensioner" warning light has come on twice, but
does not light up if I turn off the engine and restart.  Gauge or tensioner?
The post-purchase trip I had already planned to my mechanic (change engine &
trans oil, flush & replace coolant with the proper phosphate-free stuff,
miscellaneous torqueing, complete belt check, etc.) will tell.

I had a "nice but not quite" '84 928S from Phoenix inspected at Beaudry,
Tucson's Porsche dealer... enough to tell me to look elsewhere for a
simpatico mechanic.  Someone on the P.O.C. chat line sought a recommendation
for a 928 tech in The Old Pueblo and a respondant enthusiastically
recommended Dan Oebker of Franklin Services.  Porsche-trained, former head
Porsche mechanic at Beaudry, Dan went independant because he couldn't deal
with the "production line" mind-set at this very large 8-or-9 line
dealership.  His partner has a BA in Mechanical Engineering from
Pennsylvania.  Word of mouth keeps them booked solid.  I spent some time
there before my purchase and I think my 928 has found a good home.

Other immediate plans = meticulous detailing; window tint, dash cover &
windshield reflector (all Arizona necessities); bra and car cover (no
garage... any recommendations?).  Long term plans = upgraded audio, 17"
wheels & tires (after the new Dunlops wear out), custom steering wheen &
shift knob, remove rear spoiler & add body-color S4 wing.  I'm looking
forward to the occasional autocross and non-competitive track time.  Anyone
have suggestions of where to look in my area?

By the bye, I've already picked out the plate for my new 928: STAPP.  This
is in honor or Col. John Paul Stapp, the Air Force doctor who, in 1954,
first rode the famous "rocket sled" to test the limits of human endurance to
extremes of acceleration and deceleration (0-632mph in 5.something seconds;
632-0 in 1.5 seconds!).  The aerospace reference is most appropriate for the
928, don't you think?

I've been subscribing to the 928 Digest since mid-November and have enjoyed
meeting all of you, from expert (hi, Leonard!) to novice ("woud'ja look at
all these wires!").  I look forward to sharing my adventures with this
elegant brute over the coming years!
