"Porsche 928; Porsching is a natural high!"

Just wondered if anyone had thoughts on shortening the shifter lever in his
928 (5 spd).  I shortened mine 2.5 inches and it works much, much better. 
Shorter throw, etc.  I also run BG Products synthetic gear lube in the
transaxle, with super results.  My 2nd and 3rd synchros are bad (78
Eurospec) and with the 90 wt that came in the car when I bought it, the
only way to get 2nd gear when cold was to double clutch and hope.  With the
BG stuff, it shifts almost like new now, even when cold.  I pause a moment
in neutral when shifting anyway, so it works extra well.  I am also using
BG synthetic 10W30 oil in the engine and have noticed that some earlier oil
leaks have gone away.  Anyone know the reason for this?  Anyone else with
experience of BG Products?
