        Well it looks as though I will be replacing the steering rack on my
83 (157K miles).  Any hints or ideas on what to use.  Are there different
levels of quality with the various rebuilt racks that are around.  Atomotion
has a rebuilt for $310, which seems real low.  When I called my favorite
local import parts dealer he said that his cost was around $500 but "they
were rebuilt by ZF the OEM". I have know him for years and believe what he
told me.  I will give Automotion a call and find out who rebuilds there
racks Thursday morning.  Anyone with much milage should check for play in
the front end.  I think that the new rack will make a huge difference in the
steering of the car.  I just bought the car 6 weeks ago, and thought the the
tracking problem was caused by a loose wheel bearing that I noticed when I
bought the car.  When I got the car up off the ground there was play side to
side after tighting the bearing,  at the front of the tire I could move it
back and forth 1/2 inch. I followed the play back to the rack where the
shaft enters. Lots of grit, even though the ruber boot was still good.
Change the power stearing fluid, just like the brake fluid!!!  The same
porblem on both sides of the car, yet not noticeable with the car on the
ground like the wheel bearing problem.
