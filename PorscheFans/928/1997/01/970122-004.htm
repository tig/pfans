I'm a newbie and have just reviewed the last month's postings (The archive 
feature is very nice).  Thoughts:

1.	H-4's.  I always run H-4's or Euro H-5's on my 928's.  Because of the 
increased power draw, it is appropriate to install a surge/drain device (how's 
that for tech talk).  Such a bird is available at one's local Porsche haus (at 
least it is available at mine).  I have had no problems with H-4's or H-5's in 
my 84, 87 or 95 928's with device installed.

2.	Battery drain.  These pups just suck battery power - even with all systems 
seemingly off.  The newer the model, the more the drain.  My 84 lasted about a 
month, the 87 about 3 1/2 weeks, the 95 about 3 weeks.  I have installed a 
battery cut-out and use that when the car is to be unused for more than a week 
or two.  The alternative, of course, is to hang a charger on the battery prior 
to use.  I have found a battery (Daycharger) which is guaranteed 5 years (no 
pro rate), which has served well.

3.	Synthetic oil.  Porsche requires syn oil for warrantee validity in Europe 
(US law prohibits such requirements).  My 928 mechanic (Charlie Folkes @ 
Beverly Hills Porsche - highest recommendations) swears by syn oil.

4.	The GTS is currently with Charlie - - the prop shaft exploded at 2500 rpm 
on the freeway.  Thank goodness for extended warrantee's.
