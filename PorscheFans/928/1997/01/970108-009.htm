Phil,
What I discover when I had my '86 was that there was a wide range on shift 
points 1-2 just due to the outside temperature.    Between the 50's and 80+ 
there was a significant change.      So I guess the chip probably has a lot 
to do with it, at least it was buried in a program somewhere. 

If I were you I'd call Kim Krumb with PCA and talk to him about it.       
If your not a member, its a good reason to join.
