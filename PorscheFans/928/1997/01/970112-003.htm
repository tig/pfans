I had trouble getting mine to start after letting it sit for a couple weeks.
The battery would turn the engine over just fine, it would just never fire.
I din't want to call a tow truck, I'd only had the car for a month and was a
little miffed.  That night while reading an Automotion catalog I noticed a
TECH TIP under a battery charger.  To sum it up, according to what
Automotion say, if the battery falls in charge only slightly the computer or
fuel pump will not work and hence not fire the engine.  It sounded like the
coil had been unpluged.  It would crank fine, but not even sputter.  I don't
know all the details or if this was an intentional design in the car, but
after 30 minutes of a low level charge the car fired up instantly.  If
anyone knows more about this I would enjoy hearing the details or how to
bypass it if possable.
