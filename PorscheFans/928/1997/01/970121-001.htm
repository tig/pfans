I agree that those calipers would look cool, especially compared
to the wimpy little things on my car. It's just that I have this
fantasy of maybe racing the car someday, and enough contact with
reality to know that there's no way I could afford to run in
anything but a stock class, which means that you have to run
stock diameter wheels (you get an inch of extra width for free,
though) - that's PCA Club racing rules. It could be that when
the 928 got 17 inch wheels the brake upgrade was the path of
least resistance, since the calipers were already a stock item.
