Dear Angel:

<<     My '89GT doesn't seem to have a clearcoat on it.  Possibly later
years?  Or is it something inherent in  the non-metallic paint that make them
more delicate?  I have to be careful with pre-wax cleaner otherwise some red
will start coming off.  Interestingly my red VW GTI('85) was the same way
whereas my '90 Corrado with Pearl  Green Metallic paint has never lost one
speck of paint in the countless times i've gone through the clean and wax
process.   >>

The solid colors were non clear coated until about 1993-94.  All the metallic
paints were clear coated. When you use a cleaner or glaze on the paint some
of the color will come off in the form of oxidized paint.  We are talking
molecules in depth, so unless you are using a very abrasive cleaner, this is
normal.  When you clean/glaze a clear coated paint, you remove clear coat,
but you do not see color on your rag.  If you have further questions, I would
be glad to send you a couple of articles on cleaning and waxing your paint.

Thank you,
