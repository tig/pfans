> Read your sad sorry re: your now defunct Porsche.
> My (New York Style) advice is:
>         1) Get and Keep a good lawyer for this matter.
>         2) Keep records of ALL expenses ( and lost wages due to
>            lost transport, hassle time, etc)
>         GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING FROM THE DEALER AND TOW
> SERVICE!!! SEND A CERTIFIED LETTER STATING YOUR CLAIM TO BOTH
> COMPANIES AND ASK FOR A WRITTEN RESPONSE STATING THEIR POSITION.
>         3) Involve your insurance companies lawyers in this
> matter-- they have as much to profit from the   dealer
> and tow service paying as you do. Perhaps more.
>         4) Even though they only have 10,000 in insurnace, that
> does not mean they are not liable for the rest. In other
> words, they are liable for the entire amount UNLESS you
> or the dealer resigned laibility in transport ( in
> writing). The tow service is stone walling you since
> they assume your insurance will pay. But this option
> will not help you. THe tow service is technically liable
> to the delaer unless you are assigned cost for this
> service.
>         5) The dealer is liable  ( and must recover from the tow
> service) for your loss.
> 
> There are non-confrontational ways of handling this very sad
> situation. Sometimes an appeal to the  dealer  in a  casual
> manner may work to strengthen your case. If possible , could
> they locate another car for you? At wholesale? Do they have a
> car currently that you would want to purchase at a steep
> discount. I have counseled several friends with similar
> situations  and usually a solution that works to everyones
> interests is better than a long, protracted and expense court
> battle. In addition ( no offense to Texas) the courts in Texas
> have a long reputation for questionable rulings in civil
> matters.
> 
> Lastly, I would ask the local PCA and perhaps PCNA about
> dealings with this dealership.Perhaps PCNA could apply gentle
> pressure and dealer would like to avoid eexcessive bad press in
> the Porsche/coroporate community.
> 
> Good Luck.
