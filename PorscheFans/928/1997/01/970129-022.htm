What a collection!

I am running 90/130watt H4's without a problem.  The big drains are the
100watt H3 fog lamp bulbs - they aren't designed as efficiently and pull
alot of amps.  It might be a good idea to replace them with modern PIAA's
or the like, either custom installed in the stock locations or separately
in the grill area.

I agree on the automatic cars for daily driver type of use -but for me it's
because since I'm only 5' 6" I have to run the darn seat all the up to the
dash to get the clutch all the in!  Had the same problem with the 911. 
With the seat all the way forward, I have to recline a bunch back.  Sounds
weird but it's the only way, although I do worry about submarining in an
accident.

Anyways, with the A/T car like I have now I can drive with the seat in a
far more normal position for comfortable highway cruising.  There is a '94
GTS A/T at Sonnen that's been sitting there quite lonely :(   

Phil '84 928S
