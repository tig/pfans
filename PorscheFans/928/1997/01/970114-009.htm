reminds me of that mid to late 60s 4 door Alfa Romeo - the Guilia Ti (maybe?) 
that had outstanding aerodynamics, yet looked like a shoebox. 

there's a coast down test you can do on the road to determine the aerodynamics -
think you got to know the rolling resistance (or make some assumption) for 
the numbers to be valid. Don't have the details handy, but i can root around
my stuff if anyone is interested.
