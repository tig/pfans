Okay, I am ignorant of the facts.  Can anyone claim that there is not a
reason to use ATE Blue in the hydraulics?

Seems to me I have heard a story that the break components (ie. rubber,
etc.) are not totally compatible with synthetic break fluids.  What's the
poop?  Is ATE synthetic?  If ATE is the way to go, why doesn't Porsche
deliver it in their cars right from the factory?

Inquiring minds want to know.
