This topic - Bosch Platinums - came up on the BMW list several weeks ago.
(between discussion of Zymol, Bon-Ami, and oil change intervals - BMW 
list joke) - both myself and another list member have had Bosch
Platinums DISINTEGRATE while in use. In my instance, it ruined 
my engine - the other guy was lucky - his computer flagged the
problem. My failure was maybe 8-10 years ago - the other guys
failure (in England) was within the last 5 years.

Failure mechanism is destruction of the ceramic part of the plug.

The plugs had their defenders - mostly those who hadn't had
one fail on them.

One list poster observed that BMW's OEM plugs usually have unique 
part numbers from the spark plug vendor - indicating special requirements 
passed on from BMW to their plug vendor. Porsche is most likely similiar.

And I can't believe that anyone would put splitfires in a porsche - 
that stuff is snake oil and marketing. 

If you want to experiment, try the triple electrode plug for mazda
rotaries from NKG. (Assuming Porsche engines don't have any
unique clearance requirements for their plugs.)


So - porscheat emptor
