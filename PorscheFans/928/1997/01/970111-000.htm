For sure!  If you don't mind I'm going to reply via the list to have the
thread available on archive...  You might want to show your kid(s)
someday!

Drats!  No matter the technology, they'll get you.  Even if by plane, as
my wife and I found out.  Have a look at the Pfans member page (I lost
the URL when win95 crashed anyone else can post again?), "other cars
section".  Makes good memories though :)

Good place to start.  When you R&R the speakers you're going to find the
tweeter is wired off the mid, with a capacitor, etc.  Check the archive
threads on this, I just went through it and got tons of
suggestions/directions, the most notable & unusual: the stock door
speaker grills SCREW OFF/ON the driver!!!   (thanks Leonard) Check it
out!

Given your extensive audio background (you may want to repost public as
I'm sure others may want to call upon your expertise) I must warn you
the stock 928 speaker placement is going to drive you nuts when you
start upgrading.  Imaging is a mess if you listen even with a less than
critical ear.  Alot of truth in the addage the best speakers will sound
poor in the wrong location.

> What is your esthetic opinion on the 928 S's rear spoiler?  

I think the S spoiler integrates fairly well with the design, if a
little low-key.  Non-spoilered cars look too 'elemental' for me.  The
big craze (for those that want to modify) is the S4 spoiler, painted to
match or not.  I read that the first S4 spoiler was foldable but don't
know anymore about that.  I've also heard of aftermarket wings, with or
without the stock S spoiler, similar to the Mustang SVO bi-plane
spoiler.  The trick is to not make your car like any of those winged
Honda's running around.  While those have tons of enthusiasts (in the
US), they have failed to inspire me (home market also, where you'd be
considered nuts to mod a Honda).

The 928 looks great in any iteration / combination, although I've seen
some fairly busy ones that had aftermarket (?) side skirts, flares and a
really, really big wing, all monochromatic.  The very healthy engine
roar told me that this is one car that can back up it's aggressive
looks.  I admit to lusting for an GT/GTS (who doesn't?) but do like the
early the tailights better as a more 'purposeful & raw' design.

Either way those 17's are going to be outstanding.  Make mine fully
polished please! There is a sale right now on C2 Turbo replicas for
under a grand and I feel the pressure to get them before it's over
1/15/97.  Others have rec'd against replica wheels, therefore my
hesistation. (like I said, win95 crashed and I lost all my threads so
anyone please jump in here!)

Can someone post tire size recommendations for 17's?  Also note that you
have to be careful with offset on the 928, no deep dishes!

Welcome again to 928 PFans - looking forward to your posts!
