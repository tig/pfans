So, to some degree, are we all on these lists. We all love our cars, but
their highest and best use, namely carving up the road, is hazardous and,
for the most part, illegal. We also all pay through the nose (in time
and/or money) for maintenance and repair.

An eager guy in a Lexus went around me in traffic the other day (I later
stomped him, doing more than double the posted limit), and I had to admit
that his car already had more performance than anyone who is not a nut
"needs".

>I draw the line at 150mph

Top sped discussions in this part of the world degenerate quickly into
recounting of legends, so I'll leave that alone for the moment. Meanwhile,
the "squirt" factor (instantaneous transition from here to there) which
makes your and my big V8s so appealing need not bring you to 150 mph, but
can bring you 80 or 110 or whatever it takes to get past that line of cars
on the highway, make the pass on a two-lane road, or disappear from a
signal while the Camaro/Mustang/Corvette person next to you blinks.

I daresay that our enjoyment of our cars is based primarily on this factor,
and every one of us would be most pleased to have a lot more of it, even a
certain Mr. Tong who has made inquiries along these lines.

>(lost the mute button for that little voice in my old age).

One of the nice things about age, sonny, is that you feel more and more
free to disregard externally imposed advice and rules, and make your own
rules based on your own thoughtful reckoning of the opportunities and their
consequences.

>DOA either way if dumped it/bird strike/etc

.... or if you slipped in your bathtub. We put ourselves at risk so
frequently that we'd become catatonic if we evaluated and dwelled on each
such. Think about it, make your decision, do it, and re-evaluate (if you
survive).

Thanks for providing the opportunity for a good rant.
