Hi Tom!  I have an 84 928S which had a problem speedo like yours.  The
speedo would sometimes quit registering anything at all and then bounce
around all over the dial finally settling down for a while and then quitting
again.  

The speedo is driven electronically from a magnetic pickup located on the
transaxle.  Following the wiring diagram in the maintenance manuals you can
see than the wire goes right to the instrument cluster via a large 12 (or
15?) pin plastic connector.  My first step was to ensure that the connector
was making good contact (pulled it off, cleaned the contacts, etc.) and that
the wire to the magnetic sensor on the tranny was OK.  If that doesn't cure
your problem (and it probably won't) you'll have to get at the backside of
the instrument cluster.  There are very good, very detailed, instructions in
the maintenance manual for removing the instrument cluster.

There's a foil circuit "board" on the back of the cluster connecting all the
instruments and lights.  It's really a flexible sheet of plastic (?), not a
rigid board like you might expect, with the circuit etched on it.  The two
plastic connectors linking the cluster to the rest of the car plug onto this
foil.  The speedo is electronically connected to the foil via a mechanical
plug which, in my case, had gotten dirty or oxodized, or something and was
making intermittant contact.  I confirmed by putting an ohm meter between
the foil and the contact and wiggling the foil watching the resistance
bounce from 0 to about 800 ohms.

In order to fix this I took the foil off the back of the cluster, cleaned
all the contacts for all the instruments and connectors and lights, then put
the foil back on the cluster after which I squeezed the plug connecting the
speedo with a pair of pliers to ensure continued mechanical contact.  Put
everything back together and its been working perfectly for about 18 months now.

I don't recommend you do this, but one way I narrowed it down to the foil
was by driving along with a failed speedo and reaching under the pod to the
plastic connector and wiggling the foil a little bit -- usually that
resulting in the speedo giving some spastic readings. If you should try
this, do it on a straight road with *NO* traffic because you won't be paying
enough attention to your driving!!!  It's not worth bending the car to
trouble shoot this problem!

As to the level of difficulty...  this is a *very* easy task. Set aside an
entire weekend morning just so you're not pressed for time. Removal of the
instrument cluster is very straightforward.  Removal of the foil is very
easy.  And reassembly is also easy.  Unless, of course, you don't have the
maintenance manuals! :) The best part of this is that you don't have to
spend any money on parts!!

Anyway, good luck!
