Hi!

Your P/S leak may indeed be from the pump, but before you spend money on a
mechanic, I suggest you check three things first.  #1:  the P/S reservoir is
a plastic tank hanging from the left front engine compartment sidewall.  It
may be cracked.  #2: the hose running from the reservoir to the pump may be
lose, cracked or broken (mine was after 10 years of use!).  This is an
*easy* but messy fix.  #3:  the hose from the pump to the gearbox may be
cracked, or broken.  Mine was seeping due to old age.  Replacement was lots
of fun, as it's not just a hose but a compbination metal pipe and rubber
hose that has to run from the pump, over the wheelwell, down and then over
to the rack. 

Be prepared for expensive hoses:  your Pep Boys el cheapo hoses these aren't!

Regarding your "12 gallon" gas tank:  I put 17 to 18 gallons in on a regular
basis and that's when the guage is sitting at about 3/4 of a tank.  Either
your tank has something in it that shouldn't be there, or somebody
substituted a smaller tank (which I really doubt).  If you're *very*
careful, you can check the contents of the tank out.  First run the tank
down to near empty.  Get a fire extinguisher and a friend to help.  Remove
the mat from the rear hatch area and dig down until you find the gas tank on
the right side.  The gas sender is located on the top of the tank and can be
removed for an inspection.  I've never done this, so I don't know what kind
of seals or gaskets may get ripped in the process and have to be replaced.
If I were you, I'd ask a competent mechanic to check it out for me.

Good luck!
