One of the first things I had to fix on my 928S was the voltmeter. Not 20 
miles after the purchase (and still 150 miles from home) the voltmeter 
pegged. Pulled over. Found the fuse box. Figured out how to connect my 
Fluke-77 (I *did* come prepared). Drove home watching sane voltage on the 
Fluke and wildly varying voltage on the dash voltmeter.

There was a cheap 100 ohm pot on the dash voltmeter, used to calibrate it. 
The wiper had worn the spot it was tuned to. I went digging in my resistor 
collection and replaced the pot with fixed resistors. Think I needed 34 
ohms. Knew that box of QC reject 10 ohm resistors would come in handy, they 
averaged 18 ohms each, +-5 ohms.
