Well mine gives me trouble as well.  The gauge goes all the way to 4/4 after
a fill up, but when the needle is down to the top of the red it will only
take about 13 gals. It is at the bottom of the list for fixes, if this is
was the only thing screwy about the car I would consider myself lucky. 


For whoever had the questions about R&R of the power steering pump:

Looked it up in the factory manuals

1. Detach intake hose to air cleaner on left side. Draw fluid out of reservoir.
2. Remove splash shield.  (the belly pan like thing infront of the oil pan)
3. Loosen front bolts on pump a little
4. Remove rear bolt from pump.
5. Remove V belt.
6. Remove left upper section of cam belt cover (yep wanted to hear that
didn't you!!) to facilitate procedures.
7. Detach pressure hose.
8. Remove suction hose after loosening clamp.
9. Remove bolts on front holder of power sterring pump.

Have fun and let me know if you need more details.  Should be fairly
straight forward other that a bear to get at some of the bolts I'm sure.  NO
SPECIAL TOOL #xxxx, which will help.
