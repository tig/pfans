A few comments,

It may not be a typo for Car and Driver, but I think those two numbers 
are reversed for the 87 vs 85 in the factory manuals.  The numbers in the 
factory manuals are what I usually go by and that sounds close to them,
but they were 0-100km (62 mph) as I recall.

Also, I believe (correct me if wrong GTS automatic owners if there is such
a thing ;) the GT (you refer to as 90 or newer S4 5 spd) and GTS are 5 spd 
only vs the automatic S4 you've quoted.  In any event, the 87 and later 
S4s with 5 spd are a few tenths quicker in both 0-60 and 1/4 mi numbers
than the automatics.

The horsepower numbers look correct in SAE units.

The cams change for GT according to factory manuals as well as compression
ratio (meaning pistons?) and I would imagine timing.  The larger 
displacement may be due to longer stroke and/or slightly larger bore - 
anyone know for sure?  

One change that makes the GT and GTS quicker also is the rear axle
ratio change.  The "normal" S4 ratio is around 2.2:1 which is very
high, presumably for more top end speed.  They changed it to 2.7:1
in the GT which should help on the acceleration numbers.
