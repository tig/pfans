How about a superb mechanic? I unreservedly recommend Autosport Designs in
Mineola, Long Island (516/248-0066; ask for Tom or Barry and tell them I
sent you).

They are the most knowledgeable shop around with respect to street and
racing cars, seamlessly cover the range from basic maintenance to major
modifications, always do their work correctly, and, most remarkably, are
always practical (no "attitude", just find out what works best) and
realistic about price (competitive with the mainstream on mainstream work,
plus they'll talk you out of things which are out of proportion or
otherwise don't make sense).

Autosport has elegantly solved problems on my car which baffled everyone
else I went to. They also did elegant work in reprogramming the engine
computers to get me 40-50 more horsepower with improved throttle response
and gas mileage. Autosport is the shop of last resort for 928s in the NYC
area (every other shop in the area brings their hard problems to Autosport)
and are almost certainly your best bet.
