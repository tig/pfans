  OK, here's my unofficial replacement procedure, including replacement of the 
  shock mounts. Procedure was developed on a '83 928S Euro (as usual, use at 
  your own risk, your mileage may vary). 
  
  1.) jack up front of car place jack stands under front jack points. (I put 
  2x4's between the stand and the frame)
  
  2.) remove front wheels
  
  3.) remove air deflector (bolt also runs through bottom end of 
  shock/shock-mount/drop-link)
  
  4.) remove nut for lower ball joint/steering knuckle connection.
  
  5.) remove 2 nuts and eccentrics from lower ball joint/lower control arm 
  connection.
  
  6.) separate lower control arm from lower ball joint w/ screw driver
  
  7.) separate lower ball joint from steering knuckle. use a fairly large size 
  set of vise grips place one jaw on the top of the threaded bolt of the ball 
  joint and one jaw below the steering knuckle where the joint passes through 
  it. adjust the vise grip to the appropriate setting and squeeze. This removed 
  both joints quickly and easily. Care should be used not to damage anything 
  with the jaws of the vise grip. (or use the special tool if you have it)
  
  8.) For R&R of lower shock mount, if required.
  
  I tried compressing the springs to get clearance to remove shock mount with 
  much frustration and no results, so I offer the alternative that worked for 
  me, getting clearance by removing or loosening the lower control arm. This is 
  seemed much easier than the method of removing the upper control arm and the  
  shock/spring itself.
  
  8a.) there are 6 bolts holding the lower control arm in place 2 in rear, 4 in 
  front. in the front 2 actually hold the lower control arm and 2 hold the front 
  of the tie-down bracket to the frame. remove the 2 bolts that hold the front 
  of the tie-down bracket to the frame. the remaining four bolts are pretty 
  tight and two of mine required using a breaker bar with iron pipe extension 
  due to a little corrosion. loosen the rear bolts 1/4 to 1/2 inch. place a jack 
  under the front of the control arm to support it and remove the front bolts. 
  this gives freedom of motion to the lower control arm and clearance to remove 
  and replace the lower shock mount. 
  
  8b.) pull/tap out the bolt through the lower end of the shock and drop-link.
  
  8c.) remove old shock mount. replace with new shock mount.
  
  8d.) replace the bolt through the lower end of shock/shock-mount/drop-link. 
  this may require some wiggling/prying/tapping to get it aligned and through, 
  but is much easier with lower control arm loosened as in step 8a.
  
  8e.) replace the front lower control arm bolts, and front tie-down bolts - 
  tighten, but not to torque.
  
  8f.) tighten up (but not to torque) the rear lower control arm bolts.
  
  8g.) note: the shop manual says to allow the car to settle on it's springs 
  before torqing these bolts so save that for the very last when the wheels are 
  back on the ground.
  
  9.) insert the new ball joint through the steering knuckle and torque to spec.
  
  10.) attach ball joint to lower control arm w/ updated eccentrics. adjust 
  eccentrics for a best guess alignment. torque to spec.
  
  11.) reattach air deflector, torque to spec.
  
  12.) do the other side.
  
  13.) ask yourself, "did the guy who wrote this procedure think of everything?"
  
  14.) do other "while you're in there stuff".
  
  15.) put the wheels back on, put the car back on the ground.
  
  16.) bounce the car a bit to help settle the springs. torque the lower control 
  arm to spec.
  
  17.) take the car in for an alignment - or do it yourself if you know how (i 
  didn't)

Hi Doug,
  
Did you shop around for your replacement ball joints?  I need to get a pair for 
my '84. I think mine are steel, but the rubber boots are split.
  
Also, if you have any comments about the procedure, please relay or post to the 
list.  I have the Chilton's book and a copy of the Mitchell manual, but many 
times you wish you knew just a little more.
  
  
Matt
