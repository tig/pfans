I think you'll have to get under the car like I did and feel/hear where
your noise is coming from.  I used the 'ole hold a screwdriver tip to the
part in question trick to locate the source of my rattle.  I didn't hold it
against the starter motor though, but the vibration and noise was
definately strongest at the 'bell housing'...

Will have to do more sleuthing and fix it if it doesn't require pulling the
engine!

Thanks,
Phil '84 928S
