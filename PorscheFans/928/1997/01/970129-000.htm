How well do you know/trust your mechanic, and how much does he know
about 928's? Your symptoms could be caused by a leaking clutch slave
or master cylinder (not the popping out of reverse, though). Try
searching for signs of brake fluid around both of those, including
removing the rubber plug at the bottom of the bell housing and
feeling in there. It's hard to see how a clutch could go from good
to "burnt out" in the course of a day, without either very bad abuse
or very bad luck.
