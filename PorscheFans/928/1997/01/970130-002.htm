Just wanted to add my two pennies. I liked all your choices, except for
the 911. I have never known anyone who has hated a 911, even the ones who
do, and they are a minority, have misunderstood her. For me a better
choice for a 911 is Jamie Lee Curtis, there is a difference, a certain
harshness, self assurance and there was never a need in a 911 to be an
exhibitionist and the one thing that makes a 911 different from a Madonna
carciture, it stuck to its original design for years.
One last thought, I don't consider the 911 or Jamie Lee Curtis beautiful,
but I can't explain the fascination.
