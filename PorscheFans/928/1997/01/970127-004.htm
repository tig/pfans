Interesting plan.

Around here, older 928s are so cheap that you could treat them as
'disposable'. And at the price of engine and transmission rebuilds, that's
what you'd have to do. I have only heard about engine overhauls, so I can't
attest to the cost. They are hideously expensive, but the majority of 928s
should go over 200K miles with no big engine troubles. I have confronted
the dreaded transmission overhaul--which is in the $1800 range for the
automatic (which 85% of 928s are), plus 10 hours of R&R.

The 928 is in some ways what the XKE was in the early 80s--priced so low
that it attracts the kind of buyer who is unprepared to maintain it. So
many cheap 928s have lots of deferred maintenance. You may have to stick
with well-documented cars with few owners to fufill your plan.

Good Luck
