I suspect that Porsche supplied this ratio in '87-88 US 928 S4s to pass
certain tests, but I'm really pleased to have it for the additional speed
in each intermediate gear. It's very handy, whether disappearing from
someone on the highway or zipping through some curvy roads, to be able to
stay in second up to 80-85 and in third up 115 or so. Subtle modifications
to my car's engine have more than sufficed to make up whatever loss there
might have been in acceleration.

Meanwhile, the final drive ratio is not all that's different. The Porsche
spec book
(many handy facts and figures; about $10 from any of the Porsche mail order
vendors) points out that the '87 and '88 US cars, both stick and auto, came
with a 15:33 (2.200:1) final drive, while the rest of the world got 11:29
(2.6363:1). All
'89 cars came with 11:30 (2.7272:1).

However, in all 928 models, all gears other than 5th include an internal
reduction via a layshaft in the transmission, and the layshaft ratio is
higher in the '87
and '88 cars than the later cars (33:21 v. 32:22), making the equivalent
final drive about 2.38:1 in the lower gears of the '87-'88 cars. This still
permits those gears to run to road speeds about 15% higher at red line than
in the later cars, which is what gives me that nice, easy feeling of not
having to shift all the time.

The official word on acceleration is also interesting. Factory
figures for 0-100 km/hr and standing quarter are 6.6 and 14.7 seconds for
the '87-88 automatic transmission car, 6.0 and 14.1 for the '87-'88 stick
car, 5.9 and 14.2 for the '89 S4 stick, 5.8 and 14.1 for the GT, and about
the same
for the GTS.

Top speed is almost independent of final drive ratio. The factory top speed
figures for the cars listed above are 162, 165, 168, 171, and 171 mph
respectively. I've been nursing the idea of radical engine modifications
(e.g., supercharging) which would boost the power enough to permit hitting
red line in 5th. For my car's gearing, this would be about 200 mph!
