Yes, the tall final drive gearing on S model 928's -- down from the 4.5L
engine's 2.75  rear end to the 83/84 Ss 2.25 and the 85/86 Ss 2.20 -- is IN
SOME MEASURE due to Porsche's attempt to boost both the EPA mileage and the
actual (real driver!) mileage.  There was also probably some intent to meet
emissions requirements by changing the engine RPM at certain speeds and
loads during the emissions test cycle (akin to cheap stereo manufacturers'
having the volume control pump out 80% of the power at, say, setting 4 on a
1-to-10 scale... it fools the rubes...).

HOWEVER, please note that the clutch of the 928 must also deal with the
weight and inertia of the propshaft back to the transmission, as well as the
usual rotational inertia of the engine, flywheel and the clutch itself.
Porsche had already dealt itself quite a challenge in getting a reasonably
light clutch pedal with acceptable travel for a large, high torque, high
compression engine.  One solution was to go with the twin plate clutch
(until 1987s switch to a single plate unit on the S4).  This gave lower
rotational inertia while maintaining the same friction surface area.  This
also gave the hydraulic actuators a lighter plate to move in and out.  The
higher final drive ratios (lower numerically) simply helped decrease the
inertial force the clutch had to deal with.  The engineers accomplished a
reasonable pedal weight at the expense of relatively long clutch travel and
an engagement point right at the floor.

When I was shopping for early 1980's 4.5 and 4.7S 928s I found that every
single one had tired-to-bad synchros... graunch!... chunkkkkk...  I think
the ergonomics of the 928 contribute to this.  A reasonable seating position
for the throttle, brake & steering leaves a normal sized driver too far back
to fully depress the clutch pedal, encouraging him/her to force the
transmission lever (to the detriment of the shifting forks and tender
Porsche-style synchros).  My 86 928 came with the Borg-Warner style synchros
introduced, I believe, in 1985.  Once warmed up, it shifts like "buttah"!
Perhaps Porsche's switch to the single plate clutch in 1987 was to correct a
problem that had already been addressed elsewhere?  Then again, maybe my
car's prior owner(s) were either mechanically considerate or
disproportionately long in the leg!

Finally: Yes, the Euro model 928's usually came with a lower (higher
numerically) final drive ratio, which allowed the car to pull peak
horsepower/redline at top speed (vs. the US spec cars pulling low-5k).
Nonetheless, you'd think that Porsche would give drag-happy,
top-speed-limited America the better acceleration of a lower final drive,
wouldn't cha?  Then again, just how much of that treatment will a twin-plate
clutch endure?  Autocrossers, we're waiting to hear!
