Hi Pete,

I'd keep the econo box.  There are probably more than a few people on this
list who will say that the 928 makes a fine daily driver, but I wouldn't
want to paint myself in a corner.  Why?  Cost of operation, repairs.  

The 928 is a solid car, but it's still a machine and requires maintenance.
If anything goes wrong, it'll be expensive, you won't be able to get parts
as easily as going to Pep Boys, and the people qualified are harder to
find, and harder to schedule.

When you have to go to work, or the store, it's easier to not drive the 928.

In theory, yes, an ordinary mechanic can maintain a 928.  After all, it
is just a car.  Would I take my car to an ordinary mechanic - not on your
life.  Not many mechanics will care and appreciate my car as much as I do, 
so I do most of the work myself.  That way I can take time, do it right, 
not lose any screws, use good parts, etc.  My attitude is totally different
than the mechanics- I want to do it right whereas I perceive the prevalent
attitude as "I want to get it done".

Contact your local PCA chapter to find out who's good in your area.

Matt
