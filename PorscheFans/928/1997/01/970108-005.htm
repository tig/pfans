|After the S4 was the GT, then the GTS in 1993. The GTS has a 5.4 liter
|engine, and hp of 345 at 5700 rpm. (versus 326 at 6200 rpm for the GT, and
|316 on the S4). Seventeen inch wheels are used, and the rear end is two
|inches wider. The front brakes were changed to the massive 12.7 inch rotors
|from the 911 turbo.  Also, the GTS has a slightly diff. rear spoiler
|design.
I believe the only difference was that the rear spoiler was colour keyed with
the body for the GTS, the shape was identical. ALso form memory I think the HP
did not increase that much but the torque did (to 370ft/lb?).
Another cosmetic difference is the drivers/passengers door sills have the GTS
logo on them instead of 928.
P.S. It was an option to have the rear designation "GTS" deleted. I chose that
option, too much of a pain to wax around ;-)
