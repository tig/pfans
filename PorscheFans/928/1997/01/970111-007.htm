Generally, real Porsche wheels are preferable. However, Wheel Enhancement
(the place to find Robert Wood, the premier Porsche wheel expert;
310/836-8908) has some approved-by-Robert Turbo-style replicas in 928 GTS
sizes (7.5 x 17 f, 9 x 17 r) and offsets, of which I bought a set last fall
and with which I am much pleased.

>Can someone post tire size recommendations for 17's? 

Correct tire sizes for these wheels are GTS stock (225/45x17 f, 255/40x17
r). Wheel Enhancement has nicely priced packages of wheels and Continental
CZ 91 tires, or you can get the wheels from them and mount whatever tires
you like (e.g., Michelin Pilot SX MXX3, Bridgestone S-02). Under stock rear
fenders, the 255s on these wheels pretty much use up the available space.

For a lot more money, Devek has forged wheels (very strong and light) with
trick offsets to permit using 275-section tires. 275/40x17 tires will,
however, be a hair (actually 16 mm, or about 2/3 inch) larger in diameter,
and so may be more likely to rub during a bump and to change the
calibration of the speedometer by about 8% (indicated speed low of actual)
and reduce the effective final drive ratio by the same amount.
