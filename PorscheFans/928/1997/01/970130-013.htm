I heard the same disintegrating ceramic  problem about the Splitfires -
there's a whole lot of smoke & mirrors going on about plugs.

Split electrodes.  Multiple electrodes.  No (protruding) electrodes. 
U-grooved electrodes.  Fine wire electrodes. Silver.  Gold.  Platinum.  One
year warranty.  Two years.  Lifetime.  What's a consumer to do?  

Take your pick & check them frequently!

Re: damaged engine
Did you or the other owner persue Bosch for any assistance/damages?
