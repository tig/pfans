In the thread on top speeds Phil Tong referred to the 928's "poor
aerodynamics."  Wellll... cD (coefficient of drag) is just one small part of
the whole aerodynamic picture.  In the mileage frenzy of the '70s
manufacturers glommed onto cD as an easily reportable, and advertise-able,
number.  Frontal area is almost equally important to cD in the total drag
equation.  You can bet that the aerodynamic resistance of a huge semi truck
with a .30 cD is much greater than a 928 with the .40cD reported for the
original (pre-S) 928.

Other areas of vehicle dynamics are also significantly affected by
aerodynamic forces.  Straight line stability is improved by attention to
lift considerations (and ALL street cars have positive lift) including total
lift, balance of front to rear lift, and the speed-related transient change
of lift.  Yaw stability -- mainly an issue in crosswinds, ask any 356, 911
or VW owner! -- is also an aerodynamic issue.  The relationship of these
forces to the vehicle's center of gravity, roll axis, yaw axis and polar
moment of inertia, and the transients between different speeds and
attitudes,  are, at some point, responsive to aerodynamic effects.

I don't have any direct documentation right now, but from what I've seen in
pictures and descriptions of the testing facilities at Weissach, it appears
that, along with Citroen and few others, Porsche pays as much attention to
these issues as it does to cD, especially in its "clean sheet" designs like
the 928.

No, the 928 is not as slippery as it could be.  But I'll be quite relaxed at
my late '86 5speeds' rated top speed of 156 in almost any situation while a
911 driver will experience pucker plurality long before reaching top in
anything but perfect conditions.

This goes back to the whole 911 vs. 928 debate: a 911 may have numerically
greater potential, but how many tail-pusher drivers can access what we
Porker Pilots use daily, without breaking a sweat, calmly listening to Mozart?

Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?
