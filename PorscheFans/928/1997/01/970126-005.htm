    I to have been using their filter on my GT since purchased, and in my Corrado from the beginning, about 90K 
miles ago.  Like Tom, my replacement interval is about 6-7K miles, even thogh they say you can go higher(I 
thought the street interval was 10K; probably the case for the smaller Corrado filter).  The reason for the 
extended change interval is that Mecca's replaceable element are depth filtration elements.  Most filters have 
an accordion(increased surface area) like media which is only one layer(surface filtration), whereas Mecca's 
element is a finely interwoven media approx. 1/4 -3/8in thick.  Therefore particles clogging the way at any 
level(depth) have many other routes to flow through and don't necessarily block flow  completely at that point. 
 The increase in surface area over a typical filter could be approximated by measuring how how many layers it 
takes to equal the depth of the Mecca filter.  The -45(long) filters for the 928 can flow 45 gpm of hot engine 
oil.  Canton Racing Products is now at 14 Commerce Drive, North Branford, CT  06471.  Phone # is 203-484-4900,
