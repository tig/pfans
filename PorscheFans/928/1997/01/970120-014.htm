Well, John you might have a good point.  But who said I wanted to race 
this car in a stock class?  The other thing I'm wondering is why Porsche 
upgraded the rotor size and caliper size significantly on the GTS when 
the power output change from S4 (316) to GTS (345 hp) was relatively 
small.  Maybe Porsche knows better than us how fade free the S4 brakes 
are when pushed hard. I can see future modifications pushing the hp of 
my car into the 350 range - so the GTS brake change would be good 
insurance. Those big red calipers would look pretty cool too. :)
