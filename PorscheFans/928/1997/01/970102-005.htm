The 32 valve cars are an "interference" design so the timing belt is 
a maintenance concern.  But they do have noticeably more power.

From what I heard at the tech session last year, the 85 and 86 model 
32 valvers are a little more trouble prone than the others.
The reason the tech gave was that it was probably generally due to being 
a new design those years.

So if you go after 87, you get the S4, which has more power.
There were a several updates like brakes, clutch, body design and
other stuff that make it more desirable.  The clutch is a single disc
unit which is supposedly easier to balance when servicing.  ABS
came on all S4s, not all 928 32V Ss.  Intake was redesigned more
elegantly IMO, with a dome rather than the rubber pipes.
So along with the "technical" driver's POV improvements, I think the
maintainability is also improved.  ALTHOUGH for cost of ownership,
it seems the price of parts are inched up a bit more for the S4.

As far as daily driver, I don't use mine in the winter - I live in the
Boston area, we get snow and they use tons of salt which has nasty
effects on body, brakes and all but in the summer I have used it for
daily commuting.  I still have a second car in the summer, however,
in case all of a sudden I need some exotic part or other that needs
a few days to order.
