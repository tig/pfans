Sure sounds like either the clutch slave or master cylinder is leaking.
They tend to do that when the weather gets colder (I learned that from
the Car Guys on NPR). When you work the clutch a bit you are getting
more fluid in there; also, once the transmission is warmed up, it
shifts much more easily (particularly with dinosaur-based lubricant),
so that contributes to its' working better then. Two places you can
look for suspicious fluid: (1) where the rod from the clutch pedal to
the master cylinder enters the firewall, (2) take the 1" rubber plug
out of the bottom of the clutch housing and stick a finger in there.
Obviously, you shouldn't find fluid in either place.

Changing the slave cylinder is pretty easy. Changing the master
cylinder is a pain, because you have to move a lot of other stuff
out of the way to get to it. The cylinders themselves can be gotten
from various mail order places for less than $70 each.
