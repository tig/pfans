	Jeff,

	I was at an auto parts store the other day, and they had a display of oil 
filters cut in half. All I have to say is that I will never buy a Fram oil 
filter for any of my cars again. I will buy Wix or K&N, the K&N was better but 
I think it was more than twice the price. If you change the oil filter every 
3k-5k miles I would go with the Wix or OEM. If you go the 8k route the K&N 
seems to be the way yo go. I  think the display was home-made because it 
didn't have any logos or advertising on it. I was totally suprised to see what 
was inside the Fram filter - almost nothing - that's not what I expected from 
such a big name. Oh well, I guess I should have cut one apart when I first 
started working on cars. Sorry Fram you just lost a customer!

Non biased and just the facts, from my point of view.
