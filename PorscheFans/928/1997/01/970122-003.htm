The incompatible fluids you are recalling are silicone-based ones, which
is what most DOT5 fluids are. There seem to be quite a few reasons not
to use that stuff. DOT3 & 4 fluids are glycol-based, and they all seem
to be compatible with each other. I guess you would call all of them
synthetic. 

There's no magic to Ate Blue; there's another fluid, for instance,
that's supposedly the same stuff without the blue dye. Porsche
probably uses comparably high-quality fluid at the factory, and
then people let it sit in their brake system for the next five
or ten years absorbing water. The only reason I can think of not
to use Ate Blue is that the blue dye has a tendency to stain things
like the reservoir and my bleeder hose, so they still look blue
even with colorless fluid in there.
