Hmm, I'd pick a couple of nits here. The clutch has to deal with 
overcoming the power/inertia of the engine to match its speed to
that of the driveshaft. I don't think the inertia of the driveline
components further back matters; the inertia of the car is going to
keep the the driveshaft turning at a given speed at the time of
clutch engagement regardless, unless you break the rear wheels
loose.  I agree, though, that the rotational inertia of the 
driveshaft and the clutch put a lot of stress on the synchronizers,
which have to match that portion of the drivetrain to the cars' speed.

My assumption has been that the dual-plate clutch was an attempt to
reduce the rotational inertia of the clutch, to compensate
somewhat for that added by the long driveshaft. Anybody know what
made it possible to switch to the single plate clutch? Better
synchros, better lining material, stronger left legs?
