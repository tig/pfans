I had the exact same symptoms with my 87 944.  After a warm up the
transaxle would shift fine.  Replacing gear oil had zero effect.  The
colder the car was, the worse it got.

I found that the pilot bearing at the end of the crankshaft was bad.  The
part cost $10.00, but I had to rip out the clutch to replace it.  It was
quite a bit of work, but I am one happy cookie now.

One symptom that I had that would help confirm the problem was to back the
car out on to a slight down grade.  I would Put the clutch pedal to the
floor and engage first gear.  When I released the break, the car would not
roll down the hill until I pulled the shift lever into neutral.

First check that the clutch slave cylinder has the correct travel when
fully depressed.  If the clutch fork is fully depressed, and the car will
not shift into any gear smoothly at a dead stop, there is something wrong
with the clutch, or pilot bearing.
