That's a bright spot for us early car owners!  Now if I could just do more
freeway  driving... 

Hey Scott:
What's your cars' idle quality like with the splitfires?  My car seems to
have a light miss every now and then but other than that no problems.  I
will be installing Bosch platinums soon.  What a difference in price at
least:  Bosch Plats = $1.99 each , Splitfires = $5.99 I think I paid. 
Might've been higher I need to find the receipt!

Back to the thread, my worst tank was 10mpg city driving in SF.  Lots of
idling and leadfoot light to light :)  The best was around 17mpg mixed...

Phil '84 928S
