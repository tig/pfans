        I've enjoyed reading the comments on aerodynamics and the top speed
of the 928.

        Unfortunately I sold my beast last year (US 1985 928S 32V auto ...)
but during the time we had together I was lucky enough to be able to drive
very straight very fast very often. I found that up to 110mph was
pleasurable acceleration but after this point the car began to get a real
'effect' going which tended to steady it nicely on the road but slowed the
rate of acceleration noticeably. I used to always get a chuckle out of the
windscreen wipers lifting off the glass at 120mph - hey if it rained I'd
slow down.

        Anyway, with all the gearing issues being discussed etc I know that
I was never able to get the 155mph the book said my beast would do but
instead got a consistent mid 140's at around 4200 rpm. This always
frustrated me 'cause I knew that my car's best was out of reach but I just
couldn't get it there. Once it hit its point that was it. I suspect I
could've gotten the extra 10mph if I'd taken the carpet out from under the
pedals!!!


Speed threads are always entertaining.

From the overtaxed land where a 928 of any vintage costs at least double
what it should...

I can understand a parrot mistaking a wall mirror for a whole other room but
you'd think he'd at least try to avoid the head-on collision with the other
bird...
