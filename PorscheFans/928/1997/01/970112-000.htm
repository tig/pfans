Okay, there are 1.61 kilometers per mile.  To convert to mph, divide the
speed by 1.61.

272/1.61 = 168.944 mph (no pun intended).

That is not real fast, but maybe it gets there quickly.

According to the dictionary (my memory on this conversion was blank) one
horse power is equivalent to 746 watts.

So divide 340,000 by 746, or 340,000/746 = 455.764 hp.

Now, are you sure that the top speed wasn't 372 kph (231.056 mph)?  I do
not think 455 hp could get you to that speed, unless it is a free fall from
20,000 feet (nose first).

Post Script:

Phil,

Just looked at my first 928.  The overall condition was a bit
underwhelming, but I was surprised at the cabin space (the final frontier).
I could sit comfortably in the rear seat!  Alright, I am 5'11" with a 30"
waist.  Still, the car seems bigger inside than out.  Just sitting in it
makes you want to take long trips.

The owner had a bit of trouble getting it to start, but I would not drive
it.  We have been getting snow for the last few days of the week and only
the highways are dry.  That means everyone and their mother is on the
highway today.  I told the owner I would check with him next week for a
test drive if weather permits.  I am not sure this car is a candidate.  The
front right of the car shows sign of repair/replacement of the fender, and
the passenger seat back is slightly twisted.  Nevertheless, I think it
merits a test drive before I make a judgement.  And if I get serious, I
need to have it formally inspected.

The asking price is $12,500.00, and it is 5 speed, 1985 with 72,000 miles.

Seems to me a 1987 vintage would be a better car.
