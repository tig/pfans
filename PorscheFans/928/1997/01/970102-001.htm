Ralph-

I think you are starting with the wrong car in your quest for ultimate
928 performance, unless there is some emotional attachment to this
particular car.  A later car offers improved systems across the board -
engine, brakes, suspension, etc. - at least newer components.  Plus you
need the manual trans instead.

You are talking about an incredible amount of power to hit the road with
and had better think about safety of yourself and others on the road.  I
admit to speeding but racing Diablo's is another story completely. 
Crash at ultraspeed on a public road and no rollbar/helmet/safety
harness is going to do much good and you are starting with less than
that.  Please be careful and choose your spots very wisely.  Better yet
how about visiting Skip Barber's racing school instead?  If you don't
get your kicks there you're already dead!  Or belong on a 2 liter,
supercharged nitroburning 1/4 mile drag bike!  ...

If you're lucky you can try to get the very LAST 928 built and start
building from there? Now that would be special regardless of speed!

Phil
'84 928S also with AT
ps. are you 'happy' because of the Porsche or ?
