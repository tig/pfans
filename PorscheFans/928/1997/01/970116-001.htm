Hi Jim:

Any relation to Shawn Murphy of Oakland?  Just curious...

Anyways, If I can get up early enough this Sat. I'll be at Devek
'snooping' around again  :)   Just seeing all those blocks, etc. makes
me want to build a motor!  

Was your car ever at Dawydiak/Cars of S.F. ?  I saw a 928 there once
that had a sound system like what you described, utilizing the spare
well.  I thought about using it as a sub-enclosure also, but decided not
too lose the spare which I'll put back for long roadtrips.  

How heavy is your enclosure with the subs?  Since my car has limited hp
to start with, I built a small box for a single sub.  Of course the sub
that works in the small box has to cost more than the other subs but it
sure does pound out the bass.  

Also, there's a small group of Porsche owners that get together for
microbrews.  I'll send you info...

Phil '84 928S
