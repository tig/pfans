     [Great tips!!!
     
     [I too am tired of seeing wacked readings and am waiting on this
     [combination clock/voltmeter/timing module that I will install in one 
     [of
     [the center vent grills.  (I'll check it's accurancy against my RShack
     [multimeter).
     
     [How wacky readings?  Needle bounces periodically.  More frequently is 
     [at
     [night I start the car and get 14.  Turn on headlights goes to 13 more 
     [or
     [less.   Turn on fog lamps big drop to 11.  Crank stereo (all at idle
     [mind you) and the needle goes to 10!

     Be careful,
     
     Usually a drop in voltage when more current is drawn from the battery 
     (using more accessories, lights, radio) means that the voltage 
     regulator in the alternator is no longer regulating within its 
     specified range.  Although a slight drop in voltage is normal, an 
     excessive voltage drop may be due to a defective battery and/or 
     regulator.
     
     It also doesn't help; that the battery is placed in the trunk, 
     resulting in a voltage drop in the long cable and the fact that the 
     Ground wire is grounded to the chassis.  The probability of a poor 
     ground connection (or any poor contact) may result in an abnormal 
     voltage drop since a 'series' resistance (corroded contact, wrong 
     gauge of wire, lose contact) is introduced in the ground path.  The 
     more current is drawn from the battery the more voltage drop there 
     will be across the 'series' resistance.
