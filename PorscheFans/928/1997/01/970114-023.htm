Hi from New Zealand!

I have an Eurospec 1985 Porsche 928S2 with a trying problem:

The car is running lean (.18% co) at idle. We cannot seem to adjust the
fuel/air mix at the air-flow meter - it always & consistantly remains at
(.18% co).

We have done the following:

Changed both computers (same part numbers were used)
Changed the air-flow meter with others (same part numbers were used)
Changed the duel NTC sensor (temperature sensor)
Checked for air leeks, including the rubber O-ring on the air-flow meter
and the injector seals
Checked the fuel pressure

The car seems to have lost a lot of power and always backfires when
running cold. When the car is running hot and accelarated, the car seems
to want to go faster but you can feel the car hesitating.

We recently took the car to an 'expert' who claimed to have fixed the
car. He said that the problem was a duel NTC sensor and my air-flow
meter was faulty. He claimed that he could adjust a new air-flow meter
on my car. Later, when we tried another new air-flow meter ourselves, we
still could not adjust it. The 'expert' said that all we had to do to
get the car going properly was to fit a new air-flow meter.

Is there some proceedure we have to go through (besides running the car
for 20 mins) to get the meter to adjust the fuel/air mix?
The 'expert' will not tell us what he did to get the car working now
because we will not take the car back to him - this is because we wont
pay him until he does (we don't believe he actually solved the problem).

If anyone could help, I would be absolutley grateful!

Or, if you could recommend some one who could help?
