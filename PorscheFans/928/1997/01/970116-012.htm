        For those that have had to replace the steering rack, does the new
rack have any play from side to side.  What I had thought to be in the
steering rack turned out to be two wasted tie-rod joints.  There is still a
little play in the steering rack, but only if I really pry with the leverage
of the tie-rod can it be seen.  The tie-rod joint pops in and out about
..5mm, don't know how long it would have been before it poped right out. What
are the clues to a shot, steering rack, I don't want to spend 400 on
something that is only a little worn.  The output shaft is not loose, just
gives a little when lots of force is put on it in a side to side direction.
