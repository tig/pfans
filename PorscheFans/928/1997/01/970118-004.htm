No - the small nut is just a test hole or something.

The best course of action is to remove the small section of exhaust containing
the cat, although you MAY have success with a wrench from underneath, but
I didn't.  The O2 was crossthreaded in my pipe though and I needed to
retap it at a local friend's machine shop.  I think the opening is a 22 mm
wrench.  The sensor should NOT be torqued in there very tightly if I remember
the specs, compared to the large wrench opening.  I think it was around 
25 ft-lbs but you should check the manuals.

When you do remove the section, you should use new exhaust gaskets and probably
should replace the nuts as well as they will likely be a little rusty.  
All the nuts were easily removed (after using penetrant of course) and 
it's not THAT much of a hassle to remove the section.  You have to unplug
the O2 and slide the wire through an access hole near the fuse panel.
