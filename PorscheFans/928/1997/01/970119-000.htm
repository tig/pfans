Thanks for the tip, Chuck... I'll get some new bolts/nuts when I pick up
the gaskets at Sonnen.  The pipe didn't arrive today either so there's
no hurry (unfortunately).  

I struggled long and hard all afternoon with the results of my dyno test
and reluctantly  post the best run with no excuses, only facts:

1984 928S US 4.7 liter stock 144k miles 4 speed A/T
Absolute barometic pressure:	29.92 in.Hg.
Vapor pressure:			0.43 in.Hg. (what is this?)
Intake air temperature:		58.4 deg. F
Gear ratio:			45 RPM/MPH
Correction Factor:		0.97 SAE

* rear wheel measurements *
Peak measured torque:	226.3 ft lbs @ 4200rpm (corrected 219.3)
Peak horsepower:	191.2 @ 5200 rpm (corrected 185.3) 
(factory ratings 234 hp @ 5250rpm & 263 ft lbs @ 4000rpm SAE net - are
these crankshaft figures or ?)	

I did four runs on middle grade fuel.  Mark noted hearing detonation and
suggested  timing check and premium gas for the future.  I may have
cooling problems - did not overheat but might have a stuck thermostat or
blocked radiator (cool/warm to touch, aux fan late to turn on with AC
going)?  Oops, no excuses!  (No accessories were on during runs)

I was prepared to be dusted by the 32 valve cars but hoped for a better
showing for all us 16 valve owners.  The car isn't a sled by the seat of
the pants.  I guess these are respectable numbers for the age &
mileage.  I have no idea what my compression was/is and will do a test
when I change the plugs from splitfires to Bosche platinums.  

So there is my baseline.  My goal is to get to max torque & 200++ hp
rear wheel.  How hard can this be we'll find out.  There are lots of
things I'd like to try but only a few might make it past VISA.  Like a
new fuel filter, pressure regulator and fuel maps.  Stock timing specs
at 20 degrees BTDC and I'd like to play with that after I've figured out
the detonation (maybe already advanced? carbon build-up? gas?)  

Slightly discouraged but 'Ve Vill do Better',
Phil '84 928S
928S4VR - 9 2 8's Forever!
