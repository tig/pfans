I own an 84 [plain, auto], an 87 S4 [UK, RHD, 5-speed] and a 95 GTS [auto].
 I cannot even begin to explain the difference in the three cars.  They
literally are completely different (and it ain't only the RHD).  Handling,
performance, etc. are very different.  IMHO, the GTS is the Big Brother of
all 928's.  More power, better handling - - the whole ball of wax.  If asked
to choose, I would have a GTS 5-speed.  However, given the choice of the
three I have, the GTS auto is the vastly preferred favorite.

BTW - my 928 guru says that H-4/H-5, even w/ 100 watt bulbs should not need
any adjustment to the electrical system.  However, if these are causing a
significant power drain/surge, a "remote relay" is available - - this is
often done with older 911's.  Check w/ your local 928 guru.  Mine is in
Beverly Hills and has my unlimited, unqualified recommendation (Charlie
Folkes @ Beverly Hills Porsche [310-478-4095]).  He owns one of these beasts
himself and is the only "dealer" guy I have met who knows these cars inside
and out.
