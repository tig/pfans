<< 've been looking to buy a water-cooled.  'Couple weeks back, there was

 with a helmet >>

My experience (6'2") is that the absence of a sunroof is extremely important
in cars up to about 1986.  My 84 was ordered w/o sunroof because of headroom.
 In 87 additional room was added and my 87 and 95 came with SR.  However,
there is NO WAY I could fit with a helmet on my punkin head.

The 928 race cars (UK has a class) are equiped with recaros bolted directly
on the floor.
