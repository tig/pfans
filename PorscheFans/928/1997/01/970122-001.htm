Doubt it. I've had both problems on both window switches. The contacts
were definitely worn out on both (new passenger-side when I bought it,
replaced driver's and sunroof). My console is warped at the bottom rear
near the center compartment causing the outside switches to stick --
the corners are curling outward.

I would have put it under the knife as well, but it appears to be covered
with a thin layer of vinyl. I'll let youse know if I can figure out a
hack to hold the console where it belongs -- the switches pop back on
their own if I hold the corners down. For now I am very careful to check
that the switches pop back to center.

Any hints? File the edges of the switches?
