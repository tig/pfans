Hi Jeff:

According to a survey by the Miata Club, this is unlikely as owners are
as fervent about the Miata as other 'cult' cars.  There was much club
discussion in the same vein when the Z3 was announced (I think those who
bit are a little sorry now that the big six is coming out so soon). 
We'll see what happens with the MB roadster.  I for one, have been
unsuccessful in convincing my wife to sell/trade in her MX-5, although
she does like the Boxster at least in the photos.

Performance wise, for less than the sales tax on the boxster, a number
of EPA approved turbo's or superchargers are available that transform
the previously underpowered roadster into a very potent combination. 
That info, plus a whole lot more is available at http://www.miata.net 
..  It would be interesting at the least for a quick look at other
marques enthusiast page, some ideas which could be incorporated to
Pfans?

Not that I would give up a chance on a Boxster!

Phil
