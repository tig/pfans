Last night (amidst smoke and some flame) I realized that what I thought
was a leaky valve cover is in fact my power steering leaking. Now, I'm
going to assume for now that its the pump since the rack seems too far
dowm to actually drip onto anything.  Has anyone been here before? I
havent had a chance to get it up on ramps to see how serious this is,
hopefully somethings just come loose (though I've long given up on cheap
fixes for -this- car)  It only seems to seriously leak when vigorously
cranking the wheel, another reason I think its the pump..  If worse comes
to worse, what's the typical price for one, and do I have a prayer of
r&r'ing the pump without the shop manuals?  
I've had the car for all of 2 weeks, so I haven't yet collected all the
required 928 paraphenalia..
 
One other question... It appears that I can only get 12 gals of gas into
my tank.  At first I suspected the gauge (only reads 3/4 after a
'fill'-up), but, alas, after running the car to empty, it still only took
12 gallons.  A 200 mile range is a bit of a bummer.  Any clues?  My
favorite suggestion so far is that it's full of drugs.
(The previous owner is some shady guy in Hollywood, he wanted cash -which
only turned out to be $5k-, owned some psychic place on Sunset Blvd, and
drove the car about 600 miles in the year he owned it.  Suspicious?
You bet.. But aside from the 2 above prob's it's in great shape, it's
an '83, black/black, AT, 88k miles..I'm in heaven...for now.)

Thanks for any suggestions..

Chris
