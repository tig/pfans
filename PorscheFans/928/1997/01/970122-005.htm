I've been looking to buy a water-cooled.  'Couple weeks back, there was
a thread about tall drivers hitting their heads on the roof, especially
with a helmet.  For this reason (even though an aftermarket seat might
do), I've resigned to look for an '87 951 or '89 S2.

First question is:  any list member's have '83 up cars w/o sunroofs?  A
local '80 claims not to have a sunroof (didn't look at the car yet so
I'm not sure it doesn't have it OR that I'll fit even if it doesn't).

2nd question's about limited slip.  Called PCNA and they said it was
first introduced in '93.  Hmmm, hard to believe.  Was it an option on
the first cars?

TIA,
Kurt Gibble
