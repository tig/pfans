Ok, the pipe finally arrived!

The install was fairly easy since I had already loosened all nuts on the
previous attempt.  The only thing that worried me was the last item to
disconnect - the O2 sensor on top of the converter.  Surely that would be
the thing to break off!  

Nope!  After removing all the manifold and converter nuts and bolts, I
stuck a floor jack under the converter to support the assembly and lowered
it a little.  With that done, there is clear access to the O2 sensor from
the passenger side.  Lacking a 22mm wrench, an adjustable crescent did the
trick.

I put hi-temp anti-seize on all the old nuts/bolts.  I did get two new
gaskets for the exhaust manifolds but passed on the $21.00 giant metal
O-ring thing that goes between the converter and tailpipe section.  Just
used the old one.  

The only bugaboo on the bypass install was that the now repositioned O2
sensor hit the stock heat shield.  No biggie, drop the shield (6 x 8mm
screw/bolts) cut the offending portion with a hacksaw and reinstall.

Fire it up without the muffler!  Blub Blub blub.  Yucky sound through stock
manifolds.  Definately not tuned headers were talking!  So I put the
muffler section on.  Fire it up again!  Bmmmmm,  hmm kinda' sounds like
stock but maybe a little throatier like a flowmaster Mustang (heaven
forbid).  Blip it, small backfire.  Blip it again, same little backfire. 
Fuel injection must be confused without the converter.  I left the timing
alone and went for a ride (read that '83 '84 L-jetronic doesn't control the
ignition).

Definately louder but doesn't sound like a 928 really, more like an older
american V8.  A hotrodded Buick maybe?    The car also seems 'softer' in
response.  Maybe expectations too high or jaded from the Devek GTS ride!  I
am running premium fuel now and will play with initial timing advance
before possibly returning to the dyno.  These low-end tricks work on other
engines, carb'd or EFI, so I hope to see some  positive results out of the
Porsche engine.

My inclination at this point (with prodding from my wife) is to remove the
pipe, reinstall the cat and return it.   Nothing ventured, nothing gained. 
I hope the Borla system will sound better at the least...
