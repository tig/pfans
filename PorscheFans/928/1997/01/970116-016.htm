    ~~~ I'm wondering the same.  I assume it's probably OK, but am still hesitant to use it.  Has anyone heard 
anything against the use of radiator flush solutions?

   ~~~ I believe that for German cars they must also not contain any phosphates.  When i get around to changing 
mine i will be using AMSOIL biodegradable coolant wich is not based  not on Propylene glycol which is toxic, 
but on Propylene Glycol.  The lieterature on the back of the container states, "The FDA gives propylene glycol 
the GRAS(generally recognized as safe) rating, and OSHA sets no limit on exposure. In addition according to 
AMSOIL it offers additional advantages; "improved liner protection against liner pitting, resistance to 
corrosion of aluminum and iron surfaces and solder points, non-toxicity, and environmental safety".  Anybody 
ever try it??

   ~~~ Some local DPW's will accept the fluid to recycle, otherwise you can probably take it to a local garage 
and they will dispose of it.
