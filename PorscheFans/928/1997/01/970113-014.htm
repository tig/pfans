RE: Dyno vs synth oil.

The "shrinking gaskets" story is an old urban legend from what I
can tell.  According to another newsgroup and about every mechanic
I've talked with in the past 5 years, they're fine.  When synth brands 
first came out, there were some problems with them if you switched - I'm 
talking like 15 years ago.  However, all the new Porsches are filled 
with the synths now and I've used them without leakage or consumption 
problems.  In fact, the opposite seems true - that I now use less oil 
after switching and get better mileage.

Not sure about the overall equation though - whether it's "worth it"
to pay the big premium if you change oil alot.  They definitely test
better than the dino fluid - I've got some tests that measure
the technical characteristics like ash content, flow characteristics 
etc. and the synths are superior in many or all categories.

This is definitely a subject where YMMV and everyone seems to have
an opinion.
