| 
| Someone correct me if I an
| wrong, I believe that since the synthetic flows more readily than non
| synthetic, synthetic oil will tend to seep through gastkets that would
| holdback non synthetic oil.

Theoretically, synthetics should leak less than conventional oils.  Since 
synthetics are man made, the length of the their molecular chain is very 
consistent -- not too long, not too short.  Conventional oils will have 
molecular chains which will be both longer and shorter than a synthetic.  The 
longer chains in cold weather keep the conventional oil from flowing.  The 
small chains will burn off in the engine and will also find their way out of 
the engine more easily.  I use a semi-synthetic which has molybdenum disulfide 
in solution.

...and that's the story I'm sticking with.
