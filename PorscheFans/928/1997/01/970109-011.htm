You might consider the meter is telling you the truth. With the alternator 
in the front and the battery in the back we have long wires for high 
current. The more current you pull, the greater the voltage drop, so the 
less voltage you have. I think the dash voltmeter is about as far away from 
the battery as you can get so the variations based on electrical load will 
be the worst there.

Every electrical engineer knows the voltage rails in an automobile are 
about the nastiest environment you'll ever find.

So what do you do about it? Most wouldn't think much of putting different 
wheels or tires on their Porsches, so why not hop-up the electricals? Might 
consider doubling the wire running from the alternator to the battery 
(don't bypass the fusable link). Wire your radio directly to the battery, 
or alternator, with larger wires than the factory used. Can't get a much 
bigger wire for ground than the existing one, the chasis, but for Amateur 
Radio installations I *always* wire both power and ground directly to the 
battery, even if the radio chasis is grounded. And put fuses in both leads.
