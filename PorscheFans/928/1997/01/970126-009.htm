"Porsche 928; Porsching is a natural high!"

Hi everyone, 
I am a new subscriber to PorscheFans and am delighted with reading all the
different postings.  Very informative.  I have a '78 Eurospec, with 96,027
actual miles.  It is in great shape, all leather interior, etc.  It has
been repainted, Mocha brown metallic, and all the hardware under the hood
has been replated.  Looks great.  I have the 16 inch phone dial wheels, but
want to change to something in 17 inch.  I like the looks of the Cromodora
stars as used on Ferraris.  Borbet makes a look alike, but I don' have
faith in the actual fitting of aftermarket wheels, offsets, etc.  Anyone
have any info on this?  I also have a question re: my rear suspension.  The
lower suspension arms are steel pieces, approx: 2" x 1/4" x 10".  These
pieces on my car, both sides, are bent in a semi-circular shape.  Almost as
if someone had backed up at speed into a couple of low posts!  In all the
pictures, photos, etc that I have seen, these pieces seem to be straight,
no curve at all.  If they should be straight, any ideas on how to go about
it?  Or will it be a case of replacing parts?  Any help will be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Dave Nicholson
