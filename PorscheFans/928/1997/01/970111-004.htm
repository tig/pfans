My insurance co totaled out the beautiful beast at $10,000. They rated the
condition as good. They wanted the salvage and ruled out any third party
interests, sorry to those who were interested. What appeared to be minor
damage ran quickly to $8k plus. I had no trouble with my co agreeing to total
the car. However I can only collect 5K from the other party, that is all the
insurance she is required to carry in PA. She has no other assets. My
underinsured policy picks up the remainder. I will enjoying the search for my
next car and suffering in the Honda in the interum. I hope I can find another
beast.
