I once forgot to plug the connector back in the air flow meter.  Started
the car and it just struggled, loping along.  I thought oh sh*zola did I
crack my heads or throw a rod or something?  Impossible I'm only changing
the plugs, oh yeah.... the dang air box!

Maybe there's a plug'd fuel vent or faulty gas cap (man are they expensive)
?  Put something under your car when you park so you can get an idea where
it's coming from and track it down asap!!!  (I have an extinguisher mounted
on one of the rear passenger seat backs.  If a fire is raging so great I
can't get to it, Se La Vie 928S - Bon Jour a S4 !)



Good luck & let us know what you find,
Phil '84 928S
