  %% In the flat area in the middle of the V-ee, nearer to the oil filler neck? How much oil? If it's not 
coming from the valve cover seals i can't think of any other source for this. When i removed my intake manifold 
i also had some fluid which i assumed to be oil vapor condensation coming from the valve cover breather hoses 
into the throttle body and manifold. This i believe to be normal.  I also see the crankcase breathing flaws 
mentioned by DEVEK were cited on another post, though these are attributed to "early models"(no years given), 
above 6500rpm.  According to them the solution, their Oil Breather Control Baffle, is an easy installation.

    %%% I am now busily checking the factory manual to see how involved maintenance and inspection are. Thanks.
