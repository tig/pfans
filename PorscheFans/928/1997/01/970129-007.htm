>  A friend was telling me about a guy out in California who had an awful
>  craving but who didn't have a cent in his pockets. He tried to
>  panhandle enough for a bottle but people just ignored him.
> 
>  Desperate, he started going door to door in Bel Air, offering to cut
>  lawns, take out trash, clean cellars - anything for a few bucks. Doors
>  were slammed in his face.
> 
>  Finally, though, a man said, "OK, I need my porch painted. I'll give
>  you $20 for the job." And the man provided three gallons of green
>  paint and a brush and added, "It's in the back. Now, do a good job."
> 
>  The thirsty guy gushed, "You can count on that." And, he headed toward
>  the back with the paint and brush. About an hour later, he was back at
>  the door, his clothes paint-spattered. He told his benefactor, "It's
>  all done and I really did a good job.  It's all painted green now."
> 
>  The guy handed him the 20 bucks and the drink-craving guy headed for
>  the nearest bar.  Suddenly, he turned and yelled back to the guy who
>  wanted his porch painted:
> 
>  "Hey! By the way, that's not a Porsche, it's a Ferrari."
