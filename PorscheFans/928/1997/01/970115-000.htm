Hey SC -

Whoa there, remember I have an '84 928S like you.  The 168mph beast is a
Strosek twin supercharged 928 that I was reading about.  The '85 928 is
a friends.  The GTS joyride was in Devek's gold GTS car.  (We tried
talking Mark into taking their now-famous white S4 out - NSTY 928 - but
maybe next time).

I just ordered one of those cat-bypass pipes and hopefully will dyno
test this Sat. to see what effect it has.  The ad claims 12hp so I am
optimistic, even with a stock computer.

Scott, I'm sure you would've gone nuts in Devek's new shop like I did. 
The place is fairly huge, with lots of neat 928 parts ie. genuine
Porsche 928 shortblock, blocks, heads, cranks (with modified oil
passages), cams, pistons, headers, rims... you get the idea!  (I do
believe I saw a stack of Project 928 books but don't know if they're
already sold or ? )  Actually, it took us about 15 minutes to just get
inside the shop as we were outside ogling the S4 and GTS, taking pic's
etc.  I hope to have some neat photos to post later.

928S4VR - 9 2 8's Forever!
Phil '84 928S
