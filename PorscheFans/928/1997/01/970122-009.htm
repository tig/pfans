Do you plan to use the car on the track? If so, I've been pleased
with the performance of the Performance Friction, Carbon Metallic,
but they do squeak a bit sometimes - the front pads lack the 
positioning clip that the previous (OEM?) pads had. The previous
pads were just fine on the street, but faded badly on the track.

And general wisdom seems to be to avoid SS brake hoses; they are
subject to sudden catastrophic failure. OK on a racer with
constant attention, bad on the car you just get in and drive.
With a good job of bleeding you should have a very firm pedal
with the conventional lines.
