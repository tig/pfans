Let me take a moment to introduce myself to the list (which I was very
happy to find,
by the way!). I don't yet own a 928 but I no doubt will before 1997 is
out. I've been
in love with this car since it was introduced (built many models of it
as a kid -
painting rainbow Recaros on the white B&B Targa was great fun) and I
have to own one
so that I can move on with my life. :-)

I've always been very interested in car styling, which may seem at odds
with my 
interest in the 928, but to me, it is a very strong and consistent
design statement.
In keeping with that, I tend to prefer early "unadulterated" models of
any car,
before they sprout fender flares, spoilers and the like. (Guigiaro's
original
Lotus Esprit and the original 928 are two of my all-time favorite
designs.)

Which leads me to my question. Are there any books out there that detail
the 928's
lineage? I'd like to know what model years had which body and interior
color combinations, wheel styles, spoilers, rub strips, etc. Ideally,
I'd like to find
a 928 with the original car's styling, phone dial wheels, no spoilers or
rub strips
and pewter body with the black interior and (dare I hope??) the
checkered rally
style cloth seats. Damn, would that be fun.

I may seem an odd duck for not wanting the baddest S4 I can possibly
afford, but 
outright performance is less of an issue for me. And since I am probably
looking
at older, 2-valve cars, this has the added advantage of making my target
car more
affordable.

Thanks for any tips on good books I might seek out. (I have an Autobooks
store near
me that claims they can find anything.)

no 928 to speak of...YET!

P.S.> I'd also like to find out more about this Devek operation. Sounds
like a Mecca
for 928 owners. I can't wait to make my pilgrimage!
