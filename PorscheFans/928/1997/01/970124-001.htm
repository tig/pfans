hello,
i have a question, this may be a faq, if so, just point me
where to look, thanx!

fram makes a generic oil filter for all porches so that made
me question whether i should buy it for my 78 euro 928.  it
is only $5 tho  :)   fram also makes a premium filter for
about $10 but it's also generic across porsche models.

purolator makes a 928 specific filter & the previous owner
used it for his oil changes.

should i stick with purolator or switch to OEM or should
i even consider the frams since they are much more available?

on the one hand the engine is about 20 years old (118k) so
maybe it's moot :)   but being 20 years old maybe that's all
the more reason to worry about it.
