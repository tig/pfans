    Mat,

       If the problem goes away after the car has had a chance to warm up, could it be that you simply do not 
have the right transmission fluid?  It may *work* properly at the warmer temps but may not have the proper flow 
characteristics when it is cold.  I say this because i am having difficulty shifting my trans in the cold 
ever since i changed the original trans fluid.  i have not had a chance to verify the following solution 
100%(could something else have gone wrong at the same time?), since i have yet to replace the fluid again.  It 
currently has RED LINE 75W90 Gear Oil, which is the right weight, but.... their 75W90 NS, which "does not 
contain the friction modifiers for limited slip hypoid differentials", allows "much faster shifting and much 
easier low-temperature shifting.  May be worth a try??
