Hi All!

This is my first post to the Porsche 928 Digest as I have been lurking in
the shadows for a while. You will see from my signature that I own a 928,
unfortunately, it is on a ship in the Indian Ocean as you read this. I
purchased the car on a recent visit to the UK and am getting it shipped home
here to Oz.

The reason for this post is to answer David Paro's question on synthetic
oils. Yes, spend a little extra money and buy Castrol, Mobil 1, Amsoil or
whatever. I use Mobil 1 because I can get it cheaper than the others.
Synthetic oils are not so nearly affected by engine byproducts, time and
atmospheric conditions as mineral based oils. Thus, if you have a rarely
used car, the cost of synthetic oils can be more than recouped by greatly
extended oil change intervals. Having no need for the polymer products used
as viscosity improvers in mineral based oils, they don't break down nearly
so readily and they also protect the top end of the motor better,
particularly wiping surfaces such as camshafts. I won't bore you with more
details as they have been discussed at length on most automotive Digests and
there are web sites available with lots of information.

If you have a good car, use a good oil!
