Yep, it's true.  There were actually two different designs.  What you've got
on the first design is a 928 S4 engine (the 5 liter) with 300 Horses.  It's
actually a Porsche-Wizeman production, but *almost* identical to the auto
one. It was used in "normal" boats.

The second configuration was a Twin Engine, Racing setup consisting of 2
Twin-Turbo 928 engines, outputting around 750HP apiece.  So the boat was
actually being shoved by more than 1,400 Horsepower.  Jacky Ickx raced it in
the late 80's.  It was cooled by what else? Sea water, of course!  I think
in testing it was clocked at over 110 mph.
