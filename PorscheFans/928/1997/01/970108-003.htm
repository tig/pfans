Good morning all,

The S4 was introduced as a 1987 model and this body style continued through
1991.  In 1989 the GT was introduced(very rare to see a 1989) and also was
produced through 1991.  The differences between these two models is basically
10 bhp, slightly different suspension and a different exhaust system.

There were no 1992 model year 928's produced.  

The GTS was introduced in 1992 as the S4 replacement.

Some of the differences between S4's and GTS's with the exception of the
drive train are both cars are identical from the nose back to the rear
quarters.  They are flared 1" on each side and there are 1" wheel spacers on
each side to fill the arch out with the larger 17" wheels.  The rear wing on
the GTS is the same wing as the S4 except that it is smooth and painted body
color where as the wing on the S4 is always matt black and has a rougher
texture.  The tail lights are the same on both models but there is a
reflector between the tail lights on the GTS.
