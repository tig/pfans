I once had a problem with not being able to fill my car's tank, along with
loud buzzing from the fuel pump after hard running and a "whoosh" sound
every time I'd remove the gas cap.

All these symptoms turned out to be due to the valve which admits air to
the tank to replace fuel as it is consumed. This valve was in backwards,
and the tank was actually beginning to implode. The fuel pump was working
hard to pull a vacuum, and that vacuum was relived with a "whoosh" whenever
the cap was opened.

When the valve was replaced properly, not only did all the symptoms go
away, but I got noticeably more power, because fuel flow was unrestricted.

This would probably not suffice to explain your problem, but might be worth
checking for.
