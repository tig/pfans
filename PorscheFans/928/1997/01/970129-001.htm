Hello Gerard Lopez,

I'm in the Netherlands and began to wonder whether there are any more
Europeans on the list.

Maybe you should forget the word "cheap" when it comes to the running
costs of a 928GTS. It's the reason I still haven't bought one. I have
the money to buy a nice 928S4 but it will take me some time to
accummulate funding to run it daily because that's what I want. You will
become hooked as soon as you have one!

Normal 15mpUsG, spirited 12mpUsG (20l per 100km).

Not worse than 911 / BMW level I think.

Sure, the only complaint I ever heard was deterioration of the nice
wheel finish.

Very, if well maintained. "Build for 300+k" someone stated at this list
last week or so.

I think it's one of the few cars that combines both qualities perfectly.
The 850 is softer, but the 928 never too harsh. Very personel this feel
though. The 928 gives more road-feel and I like it's handling better. I
don't care for the BMW's traktion control the 928 lacks. Especially in
the wet it gave me a false feeling of safety and made me drive faster
than safe, given the circumstances (and other road users). Again this is
very individual. Try to make a few test drives!
Please let the list know what you find out, and how you like it compared
to your 911.

Good luck ,
