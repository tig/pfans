I've had good results with 303 Protectant on my rubber - the rear
spoiler in particular. It does not give a shiny surface when I've
used it, though some on this list have claimed otherwise. Got it at
a marine goods store. 

I've used Lexol on the leather. It seems to be doing a good job of
keeping the leather that's in good shape good, but the bad stuff
(the dash) has just gotten worse.

If you want to go with wider tires you need wider wheels. Yours
are 7", and 225/50-16 is as wide as you should go. Slightly later
cars have 8" rear wheels and 245/45-16 on those wheels. Later
ones still have 17" wheels, but that's another story.
