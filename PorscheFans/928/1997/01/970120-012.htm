     You could run into fade at a driver education event.  It happened to me at the first driver ed event(April 
'96) of the Northern New Jersey Region at Lime Rock, CT.  The car had actually been braking unbelievably well, 
with no sign of fade the whole day, right up until the last few laps of the last tun.  As i came up the back 
uphill dog-leg, to the turn at the top of the hill, i went to brake and had almost no braking left.  Good thing 
this didn't happen at the end of the front straight.  I should mention that i neglected to replace the brake 
fluid prior to the event.  Otherwise, i may not have had a problem, but i believe it is still within the realm 
of possibility to run into this problem at this type of event.  I'm ready for next year though.  Now i've got 
Ate's Super BLue fluid, which has a dry boiling pt. of 536 degF. :-)
