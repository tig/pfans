I just finished putting in an upgraded (!) sound system and am
interested in your install / design plans.  
Finally got confirmation on my personalized plate today - yippee!

	I just wanted to let you know I've seen you talk about upgrading your sound 
system, and I wanted to share my solution. I already had an Alpine CD unit 
W/stock 8spkr system, and it was fairly weak. I put in a Soundstream 30f/60r 
4-channel amp to the stock speakers, crossed over at 120Hz. For the bass I 
used a 200W Soundstream amp bridged in mono for 400W, powering 4-7" ADS subs. 
The sub enclosure is easy to remove if i need to. The amps are in my spare 
tire well, along with the x-over, distribution block, and 100A circuit 
breaker. Sounds as good as my car performs! I used all high-end wiring and it 
makes it look so nice! I also have it so I can still access mt battery, and 
the spare tire well is painted to look like granite, to hide the nasty looking 
stuff they use at the factory to seal it up. When I have more $ I might put 
Boston, Polk, or McIntosh seperates. If you need any custom fab, let me know, 
I might be able to help.
	On another note, you were talking about 17" wheels. If you want to see 
different wheels on your car, try  www.cecwheels.com, and click on the cec 
wheel machine. You can see any Porsche, Ferrari, etc. with any of the wheels 
they sell. I have Antera 121's  17x9f and 17x10r with 235/40f and 275/45r. It 
looks just like the black 928 at the wheel machine!
	I noticed you were snooping around DEVEK, which means you live in SF bay 
area. Ifyou want to see my install or meet at DEVEK sometime let me know, I 
would like to see your car!
