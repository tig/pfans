	Dennis,

       My rear wiper was removed, and the hole was welded up. I remember 
hearing something about them being notorious for breaking the rear window. 
Anyway the original owner must have had it done, because the switch, relay, 
motor, and crank arm are still functional. I like the smooth look of the car 
without the rear wiper, I allways thought it was more of a minivan item 
anyway. 

	Back to your story. I checked mine and the red wire always has 12V (with the 
ignition on) , the brown seems to be a ground wire. I think the yellow one 
must come from, or go to, a relay. I could not get a ground off of it and when 
I applied 12V to it, the motor spun, but the crank arm did not move. Maybe 
there is some tipe of magnetic clutch in the motor housing. Even when the 
switch was pressed, the yellow wire didn't show 12V, so maybe it completes the 
ground. Here is where the factory shop manual will come in handy. Just 
remember, at $275.00 the manuals only have to save 4.1 hours of shop-time and 
they are paid for! One hell of a deal if you ask me! Sorry I couldn't help 
more, but I am very limited in the non-stereo electronics department.
