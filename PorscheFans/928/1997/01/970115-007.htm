Howdy fellow 928'ers

I wrote in a couple of weeks ago about an Engine oil leak.  Since then I
have continued to poke around the engine compartment to see if I can
find the problem.  I think I have it, but I am working my fool head off and
don't have time to get greasy right now and was wondering if one of
you "experts" could lend me some advice.  

There is a hose that is attached just below the oil fill cap that seems to
be some sort of Oil rebreathing circuit.  BTW - I have a 1986 S 32valve. 
About six inches down the hose it goes into a T and splits into two
hoses.  One hose goes down into the depths of the Valley under the
Intake and the other takes a left and disappears.  Does anyone know
where do these hoses go?   

Also, could someone give me a brief explaination of the oil rebreathing
system in a 928.  It would be much appreciated.

Thanks for the help!!!
