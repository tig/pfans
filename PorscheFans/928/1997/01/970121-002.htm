You're absolutely right, I've run into severe fade at driver ed events
also. Though in my case it didn't come on suddenly, just deteriorated
fairly quickly to the point where I couldn't possibly have locked the
brakes with every bit of my leg strength. Ate Blue fluid and Performance
Friction carbon metallic pads seem to have taken care of that, for
the moment anyway. I think my pads were the limiting factor, so they
went away gradually, and for you the fluid boiled and the brakes
gave out suddenly.

Incidentally I've been told that the very expensive, very high
boiling point fluids are not suitable for anything but racing
because they are extremely hygroscopic. Like you need to bleed
the brakes daily.
