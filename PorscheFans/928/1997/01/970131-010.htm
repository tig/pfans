I would be inerested to know what the opinions are regarding the use of a
couple different things on my 928.  What should I use to keep the rubber
rear wing and interior components in good condition.  The PO said that when
he bought the car and stopped putting Armoral on the dash as the previous PO
had done religiously the dash crack in a couple of months.  I can't remember
exactly how he explained it, but basically what he told me was that if you
use these kind of products you have to keep using them, and if you ever stop
the car will be worse off than if you had done nothing.  What I want to know
is what can I do to get the car looking a little better without any long
term snake oil side effects.

Another thing that I have heard different opinions on is the use of  SS
brake lines.  I would like to replace the current ones and had been planing
on going with the SS lines, until someone on the list said that they should
only be use for racing.  I had though that they were more reliable than the
rubber lines, but his/her opinion was that they were prone to complete
failure and not good for a periodically driven car.  

I will be needing to get a new set of tires in a couple of months and am
wondering what is a good choice on the stock rims (16").  Have any of you
had any experience with going to other that stock size and aspect rations
maybe a 245/45/16, just wonder what works good on the car. 

One more thing, what do these S4 nose conversion kits for the earlier cars
look like. Are they all fiberglass, and how is the quality.



Thanks for any input.
