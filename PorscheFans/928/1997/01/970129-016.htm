Paul, sorry, but just two little latin words - caveat emptor - buyer =
beware.  That clutch was gone long before you showed up.  Did you get =
your inspection prior to purchase?  What did the maintenance history =
reveal?  Clutches generally just don't go kablooey overnight.

Anyone familiar with used 928s invariably writes "and of course, be sure =
to obtain a complete pre-purchase inspection by a 928-qualified =
mechanic."  Friends, it's around $100, takes about an hour, and allows =
you to pick the brains of some really smart mechanics on what to look =
for whilst 928 shopping.  If you can't find a reputable 928 mechanic on =
your own, your local Porsche Club technical committee chair will help.  =
And I do mean a *928 mechanic* - most air-coolers will be up front and =
advise you to find somebody with specific experience, or even factory =
training, in watercoolers.

Some 928 experts suggest that if the prior owner doesn't have complete =
records, to pass on the car - there's just no possible way to validate =
the car's maintenance history.  BTW, Paul, how's the timing belt look?  =
Given the clutch was DOA, I wouldn't trust the prior owner was up on =
*any* of the maintenance intervals.  And if you think $800 for a clutch =
was bad, wait till you see the what a tranny synchro job costs.  Just =
pray your crashbox is okay.

Remember, lurking 928 buyers, these cars retailed for between $40 and =
$80,000 (U.S.) when new.  They were damned expensive in their day, and =
no matter what you paid for it, you're still maintaining a $40 to $80K =
car.  Look hard and think twice before you buy.

Sorry Paul, but it looks like you're gonna have to dig deep.
