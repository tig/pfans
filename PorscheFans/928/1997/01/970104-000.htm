I agree with Matt: keep the econocar. There are places you may want to go
(airport long-term parking lots) that you do not want to park a 928. And
the difference in cost between a 'must repair' problem and a 'wait to
repair' problem can be 30%. I've seen plenty of examples where a good used
part can cost a quarter--or less-- of what a new one does.
