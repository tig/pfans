Hi Phil,

I was on the freeway passing some slower traffic (accelerating thru 70MPH)
and the engine just flat out quit!  No stutter, no winding down, just dead
stop.  I got over to the side and restarted.  Real rough.  Went under the
hood, wiggled the wiring and restarted.  Ran fine.

Took the car to the mechanic next day because I wanted him to double check
everything. Well, he replaced the sparkplugs and then the distributer cap
and rotor (they really needed it, the spark plugs however were fine as far
as I could tell).  Told me it was OK.  I picked it up and the damn thing
nearly died on the way home so I turned it around to him.  By the way, the
fuel pump started to make nasty groaning noises.

He tested it and it would run real bad, but only intermittantly.  Finally he
put a fuel pressure guage on the system and watched the pressure as the
engine ran.  Everything would be fine and then all of a sudden the meter
would peg, indicating that something was constricting the fuel flow.  He
finally tracked it down to the fuel pressure regulators not functioning
properly.  He replaced them both and the car runs great!

The new distributor cap, rotor and (maybe) sparkplugs also resulted in the
car starting much better than before.

As to the type of regulators... just stock as far as I know.

By the way, I asked the mechanic to check out a fuel smell when the tank is
full or if you have the car nosed up hill, but he was so frustrated and busy
with other cars that he asked me to bring it back some other time (read
between the lines ... not real soon!).  Anyone know if there is an easy way
to figure out what's leaking?
