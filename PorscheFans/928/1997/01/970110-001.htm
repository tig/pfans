| Subject: Leaky PS pump? (83)
|  
| Last night (amidst smoke and some flame) I realized that what I thought
| was a leaky valve cover is in fact my power steering leaking. Now, I'm
| going to assume for now that its the pump since the rack seems too far
| dowm to actually drip onto anything.  Has anyone been here before?

Check the power steering pump's hoses for leaks.  My bet is, you'll find a 
leaky hose and not a leaky pump.

| One other question... It appears that I can only get 12 gals of gas into
| my tank.  At first I suspected the gauge (only reads 3/4 after a
| 'fill'-up), but, alas, after running the car to empty, it still only took
| 12 gallons.  A 200 mile range is a bit of a bummer.  Any clues?

I think you're going to have to drop the plastic gas tank and see what is 
displacing the space that should be occupied by gasoline.
