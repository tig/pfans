FIRST: SF Party People -- toss one back for me... our throats get dry out
here in the Sonora Desert!

SECOND: To James Castleman/Susan Brew in Albuquerque -- While it may be hard
to find decent dim sum in the Land of Enchantment I certainly wouldn't
consider your predicament "banishment."  Consider how close we are to
extraordinary mountain roads!  Listen, if you folks are ever road tripping
to the coast feel free to stop by the Old Pueblo (Tucson, Arid-zona) & say hi!

THIRD:  Trailers -- OK, let's say you've got something really nice to race
(my semi-affordable list includes the Westfield Lotus 11 replica, the Beck
Spyder or... forget it, the list is long!) and you want to road trip.  It's
not a semi-trailer effort, just fun on the track with something that weighs
less than a 928 battery or wiring harness (Jah, vee vill pump yew up!).  Do
you really want to spend two or three days, round trip, to the track in a
van or Suburban?  If I was doing the tow car "thang" I can't imagine a
BETTER ride than a 928!  The English mag "Classic & Sports Cars" once did a
little sidebar on tow cars, showing a late-60s Maserati Quatroporte towing a
small formula car, and inquiring about other classic tow car/racer combos.
Now, just a thought, get a complete Weissach rear suspension from a
dismantler & use it as the trailer's axle...
