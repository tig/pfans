My car is currently being serviced by Scuderia Veloce Motors in
Sydney, Australia.  Overseas owners may find the prices at the
very least, interesting, probably unbelievable, but we do pay
a high premium in this country for ownership of such cars.
For USA owners, the Australian dollar is currently worth about
$0.80c to your US dollar (US$2,154 for the service)

Service Cost 			$650 (Items as per service book]
Timing Belt replacement	 	 616
Replace wiper blades	  	  58
Repair to cut out switch  	  70
Find fault/repair electric
side mirror (1 hr labour)	 130
Find fault/repair rear wiper
motor (replace motor)		 418
Replace various gaskets and
turn indicator/high beam light
switch				 550
Oil, grease, shop supplies	 200
				_____
			      $2,692

The hour labour for the mirror, the gaskets/indicator switch, oil and shop
supplies are estimates, but they are probably not far off.  The cruise
control (CC) has also been faulty since purchasing the car in January 1996.
Have told them about the probable causes ie. slack in cable, or vacuum
leak.  They think it is probably the latter.  The CC is being looked at
the second time around by the mechanics and labour will be free as it was not
successfully repaired the first time.

The car has done 96,000 km and been reliable for most of the twelve
months of ownership.  This particular model (I think we have Euro spec cars
out here in Australia) runs on premium unleaded (92 RON ?); not sure what
you call that in the United States.  This car will basically use fuel
according to your mood; if it is driven rapidly 19-20 mpg, driven at the
speed limit on the open road (say 60 mph) it can return up to 30 mpg.  The 
motor uses little or no oil and appears to be smoke free.  Power is 212kw
or about 288bhp.  Not stunning, but adequate for the time being.  May do
some enhancements or rebuild the engine in the long term to bring it
up to standard unleaded RON and perhaps even to 928GTS specs of 5.4 litres,
if that can be done.

Am still wavering on the wiper motor above.  I think the motor is actually
in the body work of the car, so it would be difficult to access, increasing
the labour costs for the job.  However, many parts in modern cars are 
probably replaced because of this very fact; more money would be spent in
reaching and analysing the offending part then would be just replacing it.
The motor appears to run, but the clutch that drives it (I assume there is
a clutch) does not appear to engage.  Would be interested to hear what others
would like to say about this item.

Finally, have not received a 928-digest for some time.  Have been getting
the 911 and 968 digests.  Maybe I accidently unsubscribed myself.  Have
there been digests since Christmas/New Year ?  That is when it appears I
stopped receiving them.

Local Sydney dwellers especially, and others as well, please email me
personally if you wish, plus digest if replying.
