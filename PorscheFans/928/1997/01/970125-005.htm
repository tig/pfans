928 owners,

Some of you may be interested in an oil filter made by Canton/Mecca.  It
was developed more or less for racing applications, but it works great on
the street too!  I have a remote installation on one of my cars and I =
just
installed a spin-on version in my son's '89 944 turbo.

The filter assembly consists of a machined (remote) or cast (spin-on)
thick wall aluminum housing, an anodized aluminum access cover, and a
REPLACEABLE filter element.  To change the element all you do is remove
the four stainless allen head bolts, twist the cover and pull the element
out.  The element is sealed internally via O-rings.

The element itself is an 8 micron filter material which is fully enclosed
in a perforated metal cage.  It can not collapse and there is NO bypass
valve in this filter because it isn't needed.  The housing has a burst
pressure over 500 psi as I recall.

Recommended change interval on street cars is 20K miles.  For racing it =
is
1000 miles.  Since we are using the filter in a critical (turbo)
application, we will probably be conservative and change the element =
every
other oil change, which would be an interval of about 7,000 miles.
Elements are cheap, engines and turbos are not.

The price for a complete filter assembly (large capacity size, smaller
size available also) runs around $75.  Replacement elements are around $9
each or $8 each in packs of 6.  The housing is approximately 5 3/4" long
and slightly wider than the normal long, thin filters.

If interested, contact Canton/Mecca direct in Brandford, MA or your
favorite racing supplier.  I think Canton/Mecca advertises in Excellence.
We purchased our 944 filter from Intersport in Vienna, VA. Phone
703-242-8680. Ask for Ivan.
