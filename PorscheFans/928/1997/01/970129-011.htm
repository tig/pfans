|I would say unless you're used to driving Ferraris, the performance 
|would be pretty amazing to most people.  Under 5 seconds 0-60 is
|my guess if the automatic makes it in 5.4 as someone claimed.

The figures for the manual (stick) was 5.3, only 1 tenth faster, but I think
hthe auto gear ratios are such that third is above the critical 62.5 mph.
I have a '93 GTS from new so don't ask me about depreciation I only get
depressed 8^)
I do about 4000 miles a year (mostly to events) so I cannot comment as far
as a daily driver is concerned. I love to AX the car, it is impossible to spin.
It does not need any more power, if anything it needs more footprint. I have
245's F and 275s R but wish I could get 315's under those rear arches. One of
these days I will investigate changing the rear offset...
The cost so far (where's some wood!) has not been that bad. The clutch started
to lose some "feel" and my machanic said replace it (it was still under
warranty and there were some revisions to the GTS clutch). Apart from that and
a set of tyres every year (BFGs @ $150 ea.) and some performance upgrades cost
has been very reasonable. 
The car has been to the track for weekend events and needs nothing. The brakes
don't fade, the engines happily stays at normal temp despite the air temp at
the track being in the 90F range.
The only initial problem was me! I could not keep the car under the speed limit when I first had it, seriously, the first few days I used the cruise control so
as to not tempt my right foot. After getting used to that the only choice then
was to drive the speed limit in 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th.
One other point while I think of it though that would concern a daily driver and
the S4's at least probably know what I mean, the power is way too much in the
wet. I drive carefully in the wet but still with street tyres and LSD it is VERY
easy to wipe the tail around in an intersection when you are waiting to turn
left and give it any more than a TINY bit of gas.
