Scary to think that almost all 928's now qualify as "older", especially
those owned by people on this list. Actually, we all believe that what
that really means is "older than mine".

I would claim that there are no catastrophically weak points, except
maybe for those pre-1984 aluminum ball joint bits. Obviously, newer
is better, well-maintained is better, records are better. And repairs
are expensive, but parts availability doesn't seem to be a problem.
Find a copy of last month's Excellence magazine for an overview of
the various models by Bruce Anderson, along with his take on prices.
