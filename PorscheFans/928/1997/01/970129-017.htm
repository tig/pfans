     Right off the bat i would guess that there was something already wrong within the clutch assembly.

      Maybe the clutch is not engaging/disengaging properly for some reason; possibly a bad pressure plate.  
Are you getting any noticeable vibration of any type in the drive-train?  Maybe something out of balance in the 
clutch assembly and causing too my vibration for proper operation.  


      Good luck,
