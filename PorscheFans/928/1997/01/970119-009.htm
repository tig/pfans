Remember we were indoors in a shop the size of a two-car garage.  The
car was backed in onto the dyno drums.  There are stereos that play
louder than 120dB!  On the road with wind noise and nothing to bounce
sound back would be a different story.  

For example, on the way to the shop Mark opened it up a bit to change
lanes.  Once I did the same I only heard my car accelerating, but then
he was already over... :)

Actually what was really loud no matter which car was up on the dyno was
the sound of the 'spool down'.  Now that was LOUD.  Very High frequency
screech/whining sound, like a jet engine spinning down.  example most
cars took less than 15 seconds or so to hit 6,000rpm in top gear but the
spool down sometimes went 2 / 3 times that.  Ear protection required!

The 928 isn't quiet to begin with and everyone knows it's a V8. There is
something to be said about stealth though, as that night of the dyno
runs I got pulled over.  Was just too depressed to say anything about
it.

The car was federalized with a 2-into-1 pipe, single inlet/outlet
aftermarket cat and oval flowmaster. I don't recall if it had a primary
muffler or resonator.    The car was a 5 speed, very pretty bright blue
(like a Hot Wheels car) with C2 Turbo rims.  I like it!

I have to put this into perspective also.  This is my starting point. 
(Comparatively, my old SC was rated at 180hp in stock condition.  Now
that would've been embarrassing to dyno with it's turbo tail etc.)  All
my vehicles earn their stripes/stickers and the 928 will too.  I know I
am starting with the 'wrong' year car but that's part of the challenge.

"But wait, there's more!"  (to come that is)  There were six 928's at
the shop that morning and someone mentioned that a couple more and we
could rent ThunderHill or something!  Watch this space!
