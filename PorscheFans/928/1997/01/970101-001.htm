Which island? How good are the opportunities for extended high speed
driving, either on straight or twisting roads?

Before going further, I'll point out that the automatic transmission simply
will not handle as much power as the manual transmission and clutch found
on later model 928 cars (I'm told that the earliest 928s had relatively
narrow gears which were easy to damage, but that more recent cars have
wide, strong gears which do not fail). From the reports I've heard, you may
not get to 400 bhp, let alone 700, without your current transmission failing.

Also, even though your car has very good brakes, Porsche saw fit to make
some radical improvements in 928 brakes in later years, and a car as
powerful as you have in mind needs all the braking it can get.

The car also needs to stay on the road, and your car has aluminum ball
joints, which should be replaced with steel units to avert catastrophic
failure, and rather narrow wheels and tires, which should be replaced with
considerably bigger units (at the very least, the sizes used on the GTS,
with the highest quality ultra-performance tires).

OK, now we'll talk about engines.

>I am wondering if any of you have worked over the engine for greater HP.

Yes.

>The 928 engine is very undersquare (bore much bigger than stroke), so you
can get significantly more displacement without adverse effects just by
using a longer stroke crankshaft. Porsche did this themselves with the GTS,
taking the 5.0 liter S4 or GT engine to 5.4 liters. A US company called
Devek (+1 415 592 5287) now have a yet longer stroke crank which yields 6
liters.

Apart from enlarging your engine, a GTS or Devek crank will also prevent a
problem with most 928 engines, which is that the oil passages through the
crank do not adequately lubricate some of the main bearings at sustained
engine speeds 0f 6500+ rpm, leading to quick failure.

If you change cranks, you'll need (and should probably want) to change
pistons and rods. Devek also have new heads for 2-valve (like yours) and
4-valve engines, along with many other parts potentially of use in building
and cooling a very powerful engine.

Within strict limits, it is also possible to increase the bore. The
high-silicon aluminum construction of the cylinders requires very special
tools and techniques for any boring, and the relatively thin cylinder walls
sharply limit how far you can go before those walls are too thin,
particularly with increased power.

>and turbocharge it

Careful here. There is at least one operating example of a twin turbo 928
(your cue, Richard), as built by Callaway Cars, who resolutely refuse to
talk about doing another. This car, in which I've ridden, is believed to
have in excess of 600 bhp, and certainly feels that way.

However, turbo-ing a 928 raises at least two major issues. First, there's
no room in front for an intercooler big enough to remove the majority of
the heat resulting from compression. The Callaway car has two small
intercoolers, and does produce a lot of power, but an effective intercooler
would greatly enhance this effect.

Second, you now have a powerful car with a big, high compression, normally
aspirated engine. The "snap" you experience when you open the throttle is
characteristic of such an engine. In contrast, all turbo installations have
lag, which delays the onset of power under full throttle, exacerbates the
difference between low-RPM and high-RPM performance, and causes power to
fall off significantly just during the time it takes to upshift. High-boost
installations require lowering the engine's internal compression ratio,
which further reduces the "snap" of throttle response.

911 and 944 drivers accept these effects because they have no alternative.
I suggest that you think first about making the engine as big and
well-tuned (see below) as you can afford and try that for a while before
going to any kind of compressor.

Devek has quite a line of modifications for the inside of the engine, the
exhaust system (headers and back), and the mechanical part of the fuel
supply (regulator and injectors), but they do not address a potent area of
modification, namely the computers which control the fuel and ignition.

Reprogramming these requires special knowledge and equipment, and is best
done on a custom basis, with the  already fully modified car placed on a
chassis dyno and all parameters adjusted to suit. Even small modifications
(e.g., changing the rear part of the exhaust system) strongly affect the
optimization of this program, so do everything else first.

>to get at least 700 HP.

All that I've seen indicates that you should be able to get 550-600 bhp
from a fully developed, but still normally aspirated engine, and serious
turbo players will tell you that the feel of instant response from such an
engine will probably be stronger than from a turbocharged engine developing
100+ bhp more.

At such point as you do decide that you must compress what goes into the
engine, superchargers, mechanically driven by the engine, may be the best
way to add power without lag effects. Autosport Designs (+1 516 248-0066;
talk to Tom or Barry), one of the best Porsche shops in the US, also repair
Aston Martins, and have developed a twin supercharger installation for the
(late lamented ) big Aston V8 which works well enough for the factory to
have considered adopting it.

The supercharger will still require lowering the engine's compression ratio
(soggier throttle response) and still heat the incoming air beyond the
capacity of whatever intercooler you can wedge into the engine bay of the 928.

>Now why do I want to do it? Well first I can afford it

Necessity #1, particularly when you see the parts and labor bills climbing
and climbing. A program of the sort we're discussing here can easily
consume US$30k (and possibly much more), particularly after doing the
necessary upgrades to suspension, brakes, wheels, and tires.

>and its a hell of a lot cheaper that buying a Ferrari 550 or Lambo Diablo.

Both of which, you'll note, have large, complex, highly tuned normally
aspirated engines, as does the Ferrari F50.

>But my 928 will go faster than that.

Probably so, at the power levels we're discussing. However, aerodynamic
drag at these speeds climbs very rapidly with speed (somewhere between
square and cube law), so it takes a lot of extra power to get significant
extra speed. One way to estimate the performance impact of greater power is
to use some of the calculating tools found at
http://deserve.cebaf.gov/~bowling/auto.html.

Devek's 6 liter normally-aspirated 928 S4 goes 185 mph, and I believe that
you can get notably more power than they have by spending more money and
time in the right ways.

>In New Zealand we have no emission controls and no real
>restrictions on how hot one can make a car.

But you do have insurance companies, who may feel, before or after the fact
of a casualty, that they would regard the modified car has being a greater
risk, and who will have no sympathy for your tears when they offer you the
standard replacement cost of a 1982 928S when your car is wrecked or stolen.

The latter can be remedied with some insurers by agreeing to have the car
insured for a higher-than-normal value, for a higher-than-normal premium.
This is a good idea for anyone whose car is in better condition and/or
better equipped than normal, power notwithstanding.

Overall, your biggest problem is that Porsche never seriously attempted to
develop the 928 as a racing car, so the aftermarket has had to start from
scratch. If you want to jump into a hotbed of radical engine development,
you could replace your engine with a Chevrolet V8, which engine has
received more race-oriented development than possibly any other, but that's
another story.

Please let the list know what you decide to do and how it comes out.
