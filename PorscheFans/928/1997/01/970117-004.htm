   ~~~~ Yup. The sensor sits  on the top forward edge of the cat between the two inlet side exhaust pipes.

    ~~~~ In one of their latest flyers DEVEK reported the test results of their header and exhaust system.  The 
car tested was a 1988 S4 automatic.  Prior to the install the car was baselined to compare before and after 
numbers.  It started out with 328lb-ft of torque @4500 rpm and 326 hp @6000 rpm.  Afterwards, peak torque 
occurred 1000 rpm earlier @3500 rpm and was now an incredible 357 lb-ft.  Peak hp was 359 @6000 rpm.  The 
prices listed are:

   * Headers 2- or 4-Valve, Jet Hot coated      $595
   * OEM Replacement Exhaust with Cat(4 valve)  $1295
   * Racing exhaust (4-valve)                   $ 795

  They also mention that a 2-valve exhaust system will be available soon.  The flyer goes into a lot more 
detail so you should definitely call them to discuss and/or request more info.


   Good luck,
