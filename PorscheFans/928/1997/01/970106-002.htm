Howdy 928-Fans!!!

Well, I just completed my first real road trip in my 928.  From Washington
DC to St.Louis.  I have never done easier miles!!!  However I was
stranded in St.Louis for a couple of days because my power steering
pump went out, but once I finally got one, lickidy split and I was on my
way.  

I found a great deal on some euro H-4 headlights during my Christmas
vacation($175.00/each) in the box.  At the advice of Leonard Laub I
decided to upgrade to a brighter configuration for those high speed night
drives.  But, I seem to have hit a small problem.  I was told by a Porcshe
mechanic that my 86S  with american headlights was not wired for the
amps necessary for a 80/100 lightbulb that I want to use and that I could
melt the wires if I put that bright of a bulb in the H-4's.  When I took a
closer look and my american head lights there is a three slot plug for
them and the H-4's require a four slot plug.  Should I take the mechanics
advice and not use a brighter bulb? And, is there a different wiring
harness that I could use that would solve the melting wire potential and
give me the four slot plug?

I also have a mild oil leak from my engine.  I only lost about a quart over
the 1600 miles that I drove over Christmas, but that is more than enough
to concern me.  Oil is gathering in the front of the valley of the engine.  I
took off the box shaped part of the intake manifold to check the vavle
cover gaskets and they are not leaking, but there is a small amount of
oil(2-3  tablespoos) in the manifold.  Is the oil in the manifold normal? 
What is buried underneath all that intake manifold that could leak?

BTW - Have any of you timing belt advocates changed your cam
chains?  I had the pleasure of seeing two 928's that had lost there chain
tensioners and broken.  One had 60,000 miles and the other had
140,000.  Be very afraid, it was ugly and expensive!!!

Thanks for any advice you can give!!!
