>> I'm new to this list, although I've been on the 911 list for a while.  I'm
interested in a 928 for a daily driver (about 8-10,000/yr.). 

I've found an '84 Euro w/ 49,000 miles and 310 h.p.  Those of you who've had
experience w/ 928's - is the Euro model trouble? <<

Problems with Euro cars are rust and the quality of emissions work done to bring the 
car into EPA compliance.

So you just have two additional things to carefully check prior to purchase.  Any Euro 
car should be inspected by a body shop familiar with 928.  The 928 does use galvanized 
steel for most body parts, but a 928 that has more than a very minor amount of rust may 
not be worth the trouble.

Remember that the owner is responsible for compliance.  If your car has been 
incorrectly converted or the work done with substandard parts, you may have to do it 
all over again.  In California, rules are tougher and seller is required to furnish the 
smog certificate.  I would make that a pre-condition to purchase.

Because of uncertainty about rust and EPA compliance, I would expect the Euro car to 
cost less than the equivalent US car, despite the added HP.
