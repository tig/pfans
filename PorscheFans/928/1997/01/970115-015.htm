Why would you put a 928 body on a Rabbit drivetrain if you had a 928
drivetrain in the first place!!!???  Dave's right, it was a Rabbit body
ontop of 928's stuff.  When they sat next to each other, the "928" Rabbit
was bulging from the sides trying to hide what was underneath, wheras the
slim, stock Rabbit looked nice and, well, 60hp-ish.
You wouldn't really notice it if it was by itself, except for the phone dial
wheels and good ole V8 exhaust note.  I have a few pics of it if anyone
would like them... There was a big article back in some R&T that tested it.
