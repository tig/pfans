Great tips!!!

I too am tired of seeing wacked readings and am waiting on this
combination clock/voltmeter/timing module that I will install in one of
the center vent grills.  (I'll check it's accurancy against my RShack
multimeter).

How wacky readings?  Needle bounces periodically.  More frequently is at
night I start the car and get 14.  Turn on headlights goes to 13 more or
less.   Turn on fog lamps big drop to 11.  Crank stereo (all at idle
mind you) and the needle goes to 10!

I hope cleaning the contacts will help when I pull the pod...

Phil
