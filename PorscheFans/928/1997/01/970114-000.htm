Hey Scott!

Thanks for the reply & thanks to everyone else also who took up the
challenge to see what the numbers converted to.  Again, those figures
were straight from the article, and I have no idea if the car can do
more than 168mph.

What I do know, is my friend's '85 is fresh out of Devek's shop and has
power up the ying yang now.  It was all too easy to break traction at
the 1st/2nd shift quite unintenionally.  We took a good run down the
road, albeit half moderately as the motor still needs break-in time.  He
is a very happy camper!

We were also fortunate to ride along in one of their GT's.  I am
horsepower crazed at this point and wish I could wiggle my nose and turn
my car into a Devek 32valver (with manual trans definately!).

I'll have to be patient for now and continue tweaking my car.

How's your car?  Any new mod's / timeslips you can share?
