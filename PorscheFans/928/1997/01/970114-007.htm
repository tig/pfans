   Dave,
for some reason all of the above doesn't seem quite right. In fact it seems
totaly ass backwards of what the guys at Devak and 928 Int. were telling me
just a couple weeks ago. Are ya sure they didn't put the 928 body on the
Rabbit and it went faster instead of the other way around?

   Lemmy no,

their health or my financial statement, well it just couldn't be that
important, could it? :-) white)
