     Yes, factory figures are at the crank, not road hp.  The usual correction factor to convert road to crank 
hp is 0.8 - 0.85.  If we use the more conservative 0.85, your crank number is 217.9hp. and 266.2 ft-lb of 
torque.  Not too shabby. :-) If you recall DEVEK's latest flyer where they discuss the dyno results for their 6 
liter engine, it tests out at 359hp and 397ft-lb(both at the rear wheels).  As a comparison they provide the 
ROAD results for a stock GT; 275hp and 270ft-lb.  Comparing these figures to factory figures, the conversion 
factor works out to be 275hp/326hp = 0.84(some difference between 5sp and auto).  So if they were to print 
*factory* numbers for their 6 liter stroker kit it might read, 427hp @5700rpm and 473ft-lb @3250rpm.  Awesome 
numbers, eh??.

    P.S. - Make sure and let us know when Mark or Susan give you a ride in their 6 liter monster.
