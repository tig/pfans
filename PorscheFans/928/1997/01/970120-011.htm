	Mine leaked about 1/2 the filter content plus the amount in the short fuel 
line.

	Actually, I think it is a 9 volume set, and probably worth it!

	Dont use pliers, mine were stuck, so I used pliers and they broke, but I was 
replacing them anyway.

	No, but I have RR'd both my window, and sunroof motors, pretty easy except 
for making the silicon-bronze bushing for one of the window winder motors(the 
original one cracked in half). If your motors stop working, don't throw them 
away or replace them until you take the motor apart and inspect it. My center 
console was sun warped and my window switches would get stuck in the up or 
down position for a long time. I found a "spoon shaped" set of contact points 
in a small enclosure in the motor housing. These spring open when excessive 
current causes excessive heat. Mine finally stuck open, so I bent them back, 
and filed the burned contacts. I also had to cut my center console slightly 
with a razor knife, so that the switches would not stick ever again. Someday I 
will replace the con$ole(pun intended).  By the way is your S4 a 5 speed?
