Cool.  The car must be running rich now though since the pipe install
(slight backfiring on decel).  This is a good thing though as I'm going to
play with the advance when I have the time (ha ha get it?).  I was reading
an article in Hot Rod though that quoted Bill Jenkins I think that he
wouldn't run more than 20 degrees on current fuels. That's what it is now! 
Oh well, just put in a bottle of that injector cleaning stuff with the
second tank of premium.  The car is running good and I'm getting used to
sound of the pipe.

So must the cops since they seem to be following me everywhere lately. 
Maybe on this list even!  I am typing faster than I drive in the city so
have toned it down alot.  Actually pretty fun to coast around then give it
blip and watch heads flip around - wazzat?  One of those Big Porsches!

Ok, back to work...  (with car sitting peacefully in the garage!)
