        You'd think that 4th was still well in range, wouldn't you? Mine was
the four speed auto so gear wise it was at the limit or close to it, another
cog would've been very nice however. Even though I wanted to go as fast as
possible I probably used the wrong term when I said 'frustrated' - what I
should've said was 'My speed lust remained unfulfilled'. I imagine that the
ratios being discussed earlier in this thread all played a part. 

        Pushing the 4 spd auto did have its moments however. A couple of
times I'd be topping 130 or thereabouts and at the end of the pedal and it'd
do its pause'n'roar kick back to third which was a huge rush but didn't feel
healthy at all for the car. I generally found that a kick back to 3rd at
around 105mph was a real blast and always gave the passenger a healthy
respect for the power of my baby - me too actually, I was always in awe of
my car. 

        3rd never felt right to me after about 120 as I didn't need to push
the needle for any reason because the road gave me time to wind it out
slowly. The thought of breaking something expensive was an ever present
black cloud.

Cheers,

I can understand a parrot mistaking a wall mirror for a whole other room but
you'd think he'd at least try to avoid the head-on collision with the other
bird...
