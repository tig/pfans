I'm back from the Philly auto show.  I took my friend Debbie with me. Debbie 
has an art background.  The Porsche display consisted of 911's and three 
Boxsters.  The Boxsters attracted quite the crowd.  The red Boxster had its 
hood, trunk and doors open but nobody was allowed to sit in it.  In addition 
to the red Boxster there were a black one and a silver one.  These two, as all 
the 911's,  were locked up.  Debbie did not like the rear ends of the 911's or 
the whale tail on the Turbo.  The 911's interior still looked like the 
original design -- which to some people is good -- but we didn't like it.  And 
alas, no 928's to be found.  RIP.

Other show observations:
The Mercedes SLK (and all their cars) was left unattended.  You could crawl 
through them, lift the hood, poke the engine, or kick the tires.  Debbie first 
said the SLK was too small, then we sat inside it and her thoughts changed (no 
Deb, wait until you see the Boxster). 

Cadillac Catera.  Debbie said, and I agreed, that the chrome wheels and the 
chrome grill were "too bright."  Caddy: so close, yet so far.

There were SUV's all over the place.  

A lot of people looking at the Diablo.  There were three Ferarris that were 
being ignored.  The new vette was there with three women and a guy singing and 
dancing -- how pathetic.  You know what they say about Corvettes -- big 
engine, big tires, big deal.  Mazda had a speedster on display.  The Prowler 
was there and did not strike Debbie's fancy.  A couple Rollers and Bentlys 
were there.  One word describes them -- excessive.

Best value		Acura 3.0CL (stickered at $26.8k)
Best interior 		Jaguar
Best seats		Volvo 850
Debbie's favorite	        	BMW 850ci
