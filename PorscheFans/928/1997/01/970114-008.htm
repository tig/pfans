......After 30 minutes of a low level charge the car fired up instantly.  If
anyone knows more about this I would enjoy hearing the details or how to
bypass it if possable...
To protect the computer in all Bosch FI cars , The computer will not turn on
at voltages below 9.5.  With a cranking engine in cold weather after sitting
a few days with a  old battery, the 9.5 threshold is quite easy to cross.
 This system should not be disabled, but now you can purchase a battery buddy
that will help prevent a constant drain from discharging the battery.  It
will allow for the clock and stereo memory to continue to function, but will
shunt any major drain.  Always start the car with all accessories off , like
heater fans and wipers, but if the car does not fire after a few seconds and
the voltage gague shows 9.5 or less, You must charge the battery, or push
start the car ( not recommended ).  Some new batteries have a extra boost
switch, but I dont think they have the group spec for porsches.  They just
will not fit in the required space. If your battery fails to deliver 1/2 of
its CCA rating for 15 seconds at voltages greater than 9.5, It needs to be
replaced. Think of this as the toll for having a high preformance machine,
J.C. Whitney used to sell a rope pull starter for VW bugs, but the size of
the pulley needed to crank a 928 engine by hand pull would be larger than car
itself. Most national chains can test batteries while you wait, Do not wait
until you are stranded before you decide to test a older battery.
