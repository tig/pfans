Dave:

Thanks for the info. However, from what my Fluke said, the gage is 
correct. I think my problem is the regulator. By the way, did you break 
any of the white tangs on the back of the gage cluster when you removed it?

Regards,
Steve

One of the first things I had to fix on my 928S was the voltmeter. Not 20
miles after the purchase (and still 150 miles from home) the voltmeter
pegged. Pulled over. Found the fuse box. Figured out how to connect my
Fluke-77 (I *did* come prepared). Drove home watching sane voltage on the
Fluke and wildly varying voltage on the dash voltmeter.

There was a cheap 100 ohm pot on the dash voltmeter, used to calibrate it.
The wiper had worn the spot it was tuned to. I went digging in my resistor
collection and replaced the pot with fixed resistors. Think I needed 34
ohms. Knew that box of QC reject 10 ohm resistors would come in handy, they
averaged 18 ohms each, +-5 ohms.
