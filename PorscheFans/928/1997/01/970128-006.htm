A much more fun question.

Certainly a matter of personal taste:

356= Sophial Loren (aging well, considering, but aging, nevertheless)
914= Joey Heatherton (cute at the time, but turning scary)
911= Madonna (love her or hate her, she goes from strength to strength and
looks great)
928= Racquel Welch (voluptuous, but perhaps underappreciated until you
notice how great she still looks)
986= Drew Barrymore (I know people are crazy about her, but I don't quite
get it)
