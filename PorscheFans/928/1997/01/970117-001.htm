Hi all:

The pipe didn't arrive yet but I've begun prep by loosing the cat nuts
(hah!) 17mm, exhaust manifold nuts (13mm) and air tube hose (used a
monkey wrench, 22mm?).  I put copious amounts of liquid wrench first
while parts warm and surprisingly all nuts came off quite easily. 
(Recall I have 140k+ miles)  Encouraging but 'your mileage may vary'
caveat. You might want to prepare for a noisy ride to a muffler shop
just in case.

The air tube I was afraid it would break.  Look carefully at the tube,
one part is welded at the nut - do not try to turn this part!!!  The
tube coming from the engine has the nut that turns in place.  The
replacement pipe had better come with the proper air tube fitting or I'm
going to be one PO'd customer!

The 02 sensor must be mounted on the exhaust manifold itself, I didn't
see it right away.  From crawling around under the motor, I can see a
header install would take the better part of a day, if not days, to lift
the motor up/etc.  This also needs to include a custom exhaust since
there's no way headers will bolt up to your factory converter.  Unless
someone knows of 'shorty' headers for the 928?  Hey there's an idea! 
Would be nice to have either set of headers though...  

I think I'll crank the motor on for just a short bit to hear the Porsche
V8 uncorked.  Hmm, maybe take a ride around even :)  nah, I don't want
to burn any valves or ?

Hopefully more to report tomorrow!
Phil '84 928S
