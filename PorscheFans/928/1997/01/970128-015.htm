My 928, what a car! I've only driven it for 2 hours since I bought it and
I'm in love...but there is one slight problem.

When I first drove it, I noticed it was very difficult to get the car into
first gear or reverse. The gears weren't grinding or anything, but it was
just *real* hard to get it to finally get into gear (if I turn the car off,
I could then put it into gear, and turn the car on with the clutch
depressed). I ran into this a couple times at red lights, pissed off the
people behind me, oh well.

On top of this, the clutch pedal hangs. Anyway, I drove the car about 200
miles that first day, but by nightfall, serious problems had developed.
First gear was even harder to deal with, but now the gears started to
grind. First, second, and reverse were all a mess. It would pop out of
reverse and grind terribly in other gears. I finally got it into first and
got home going 10 miles an hour in first.

So today my mechanic called me and told me that my clutch is burnt out, oh
great, just what I need.

What I really need to know is, what caused this?? A few hours of driving
and the clutch is burnt out (and I'm not a bad driver either, I drive my
brother's Esprit turbo more than he does w/no problems), what gives? I
really don't want to spend $800 to replace the clutch again. Is there
anything to look for on the 928 (85 Euro) to warn of clutch problems? Some
type of driving or thing to avoid that this cars clutch doesn't respond
well to? Or was my clutch just ready to go when I bought the car, and the
130 mph runs didn't help the situation much?

Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!
