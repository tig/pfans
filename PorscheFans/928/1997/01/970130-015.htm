Hi Stephane:

If it's only minor swirls, hopefully it's just in the top coat of wax. 
McGuires has a full line of waxes and polishes from barely abrasive to
major abrasive.  Go easy at first.

Others may deplore this but I am a firm believer in waxes with colored
pigment for older cars whose paint is less than pristine.  The colored
waxes fill in scratches, swirls, etc. and give new life and depth to the
paint.  

Tonight I tried that Clay Magic stuff on my "burgandy" 928.  I had no idea
if it would ruin my paint but surprise the clay just glides around with
soapy water.  I did the whole car.  It appeared to have removed the top
layer of wax and nothing more.  The car body is super smooth now!  After
waxing with the aforementioned colored wax, the results are great!  Very
deep shine, images reflect great.  This car has lots of paint chips on the
hood but they are effectively hidden now.  I ran out of time or else I
would've put a top coat, finishing wax on also for further depth &
protection.  It's so shiny now maybe I should have the rims polished to
match!

Another trick I've used before was to wet-sand paint.  This is a very
aggressive action and should only be done for majorly screwed paint
condition.  What you are doing here is removing not only the wax coat
build-up, but a layer(s) of actual paint too!  Do not use a buffer or you
will go down to primer or worse, metal!  You must use real wet-sandpaper
(look on the back for markings), 1000 - 1500 grit, very fine.  Keep a water
hose running so the area is constantly flushed as you sand in small
sections.

When you are done and dry the car off you're going to sh*t because the
entire car paint now has a dull finish like it's been in a desert for 100
years.  Do not panic.  Step two is to re-polish the entire car, bringing
back a like new shine!  Here, an electric or pneumatic buffer will do
wonders to save your arms,  shoulders and back.  Again, McGuires has the
right stuff.  I started with the least aggressive polishing compound a
couple of times, then colored wax, then a finish wax topcoat (car garaged
in storage during all of this).  Fantastic results.  Like new paint.  BTW
the car was a very dark grey/black metallic (Pantera Gray) 911SC with Turbo
tail and fully polished 7's / 8's.  Oh man it came out killer!

There are some new products that I'd like to try now too.  They are billed
as the no-wax solution, wipe on & wipe off, acrylic top coat I think.  Like
a clear coat you apply yourself.  These come in colors also.  I think it's
a two-step process: 1. wax remover  2. acrylic coat .  This might be a good
try especially for a 928 which seems to chip very easily on the hood and
mirrors if my car is any indication.  Although I'm not thrilled about
mirror bras and would rather use a clear adhesive plastic sheet instead.

Whoa.  Sorry to have rambled on so much.  You will find I am a nut, but at
least a PorscheNut!  Next time you're in Grand Auto or the like, you might
want to amble on over to the book section and see what's available on auto
paint/finishes, etc.

Have fun!
Phil '84 928S
ps.  
Do NOT wetsand your car!!!
