Hi guys, I'm not a Porsche owner yet, but I know I'll be one, specifically
a 928 owner, pretty soon.

I found a 928 here in Boston, and I need you're help evaluating it. Here's
all the info. I have for you:

__1982 928__
Red/tan leather
Every option
5 speed
sunroof
alloy wheels
never driven in winter, stored in garage
Showroom condition
never in accident
interior perfect, no problems with leather at all
128k miles, recently replaced clutch

He's asking $8,500, which seems high (I know he's had the ad running for a
long time, so others probably feel the same way).

Anything I should be aware of when I take a look at it? What's the
concensus, buy, or keep looking?

Also, if I do buy this 928, I plan on updating the front and rear to the S4
style. Any tips/info. from anyone who has done this? What kind of cost
should I expect?

Thanks for any responses, and Happy New Year
