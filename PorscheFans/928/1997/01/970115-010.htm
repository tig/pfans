The one that goes straight into the intake fits into a metal pipe that 
protrudes from the throttle body.  I unplugged this hose by accident
once because I forgot to put the clamp on it when reattaching my intake
dome.  To reclamp it required removing the dome again (oh boy - needless
to say I just keep an eye on it until the next time I disassemble that
beast ;).

If you're careful you can plug it back in, otherwise, it will
splatter oil in the valley between the V in your head (is that clear?).
I'm talking about the reservoir underneath the intake pipes and all
in the top outside center of the engine.

As I recall, I think the other one goes into the oil filler receptacle - sorry
don't have the technical part name here.  It's the black thing protruding out
which you fill oil into.  This part bolts down via two 6 mm bolts as I recall
kind of behind the thermo housing.  It's kind of shaped like this

Where the O is the oil filler cap.

These are both part of the rebreathing system as you've pointed out.  It's
akin to a PCV system as I understand it.  Someone else will have to
explain why we need PCV - I think it has to do with emissions.  I don't
know of any PCV valve like in other cars that can be changed.  It's all
"built-in" from what I can tell.
