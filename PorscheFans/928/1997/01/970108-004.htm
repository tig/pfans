     Yes, the front and rear of the 928 were both modified for the 
     1987 S4 model in order to make it sleeker and more aerodynamic.

     The GTS first came out in the 1993 model year.  It's a *lot* 
     faster than the S4, at least on paper (I've never driven a GTS).  
     It would also be quite a bit more expensive on the used-car 
     market.  From what I've read here on the list, you could just 
     retrofit a GTS crankshaft in an S4 and wind up with similar 
     power.  Does anybody know how much that would cost, parts and 
     labor?  Car & Driver had the following numbers for the 
     automatic-transmission 1983 S, 1985 S (first 32-valve model), 
     1987 S4, and 1993 GTS (I'm working from memory here,so cut me 
     some slack!):
     
                power   torque  0-60    1/4 mi  handling
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     1983 S     234     ~270    7.0     ~15.3   .76 g (lame tires)
     1985 S     288     302     6.2     14.7    .83
     1987 S4    316     317     6.6     14.7    .85
     1993 GTS   345     369     5.3     13.8    .87
     
     That's not a typo that the '87 was slightly slower in lower-speed 
     acceleration that the '85 model.  It had a higher top speed, 
     though, and higher top-end acceleration.  The only cosmetic 
     change that I'm aware of for the GTS is wider fender flares in 
     back to accomodate the slightly larger wheels.  FWIW, I believe 
     that the '90 S4 had a few changes that sound good to me: 
     electronic limited-slip differential, tire-pressure warning 
     lights, and sophisticated knock sensor. Comments, anyone?
