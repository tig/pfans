Do you have to buy the starter or can you get just the solenoid? The
starter motor must be ok if it is spinning... 

Since we're on the subject here's another question for the list:

My car has what I thought was a rattling exhaust converter.  However, after
removing the converter I still have the rattle!  It is coming from inside
the 'bell housing' directly attached to the engine.

My guess is that my starter gear isn't fully retracting and periodically
rattling along the starter ring teeth as the motor is running.   Are there
adjustments for the gear positioning or do you think I need a new
starter/solenoid also?

Thanks,
Phil '84 928S
