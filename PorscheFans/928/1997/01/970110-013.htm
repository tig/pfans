Lets see, there is a Matchbox "Classic Cars" or some such of the 928. About 
$5.

Then again, I found a hot pink 928 at Winn Dixie one day with a Porsche 
emblem pastered on its hood like a Firebird. Had '60's style classic Cragar 
chrome wheels. And sits high enough to be a 4WD pickup truck. Still has the 
price tag, $4.39.

But one day I had enough of it and found a capable hobby shop. Dug thru the 
catalogs and had special ordered a 1/24th scale 928S. The model company was 
FUJIMI. Most of the writting on the box is Japanese but it might be part 
number 800. Don't think that means 800 yen as the kit was about $14.

The kit is supposed to be the 5L 32V car, but the wheels are phone dials.

Hmm, "Mark Williams" rings a bell, and "whois venus.net" says Charlestown, 
Indianna. Any relation to the Mark Williams Company of C and Cohenent fame?
