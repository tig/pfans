Hello all

I just got a '78 euro 928 that's in great shape. One thing concerns me 
though, a CV boot on the LR outside is torn all the way around. I bought
the car
from a friend of mine and it was that way when he had it. He only had the
car for
a couple months. My question is can the CV joint be serviced? I would think
that
would depend on how long the boot had been torn and what kind of shape the
CV joint
is in. Has anyone else had to do this? 

Thanks

Mark
