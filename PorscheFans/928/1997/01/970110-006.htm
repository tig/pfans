Re: Door Tint -> yes, it's legal in AZ, but I'm not sure what percentage.

I ran both that AND my 1990 Escort Solo (cordless) on the 2,200 mile drive
from suburban D.C. back to Tucson.  The Escort produced many fewer false
reports, and seemed to catch the radar traps (those that could be confirmed
visually) slightly earlier.  I did not get any sort of manual on the BEL
with my service history papers and I haven't really taken that close a look
at it, so I may be able to adjust it for better performance.  Nonetheless, I
got caught on I-20 west of Ft. Worth, TX by a county sherrif with an
"instant-on" radar unit (85 in a 70mph zone.  You know... "safe & prudent").
Frankly, I would not consider either of my units a reliable hedge against
the dark forces of municipal finance.  Time to catch up on the latest
magazine reviews and comparison tests!

>Regarding audio upgrades: I've got two problems here:
>1) I am a absolute audio nut, with more invested in my home system than in
the 928 (all analog front end, tube electronics, Fried speakers with
transmission-lines, nearly 1,500 LP's etc.); and 2) I spent 16 years
marketing for some of America's top symphony orchestras before moving over
to the performing arts presenting field here at the U of AZ.  This
experience sort of sets a high standard for ANY system's claim to realistic
recreation.  All of this adds up to a rather sharp "shelf" in my tastes...
what qualifies as "excellent" is vastly more expensive than the rather broad
range of what constitutes "minimally acceptable - hey, don't complain, it
plays."  My finances don't have the roughly $2,000-$2,500 it appears a truly
decent auto system, expertly installed, will cost right now.  Until then,
I'll remember that music is an active process, you get out what you - the
listener - puts in, even if its only a lowly clock radio.  Short term,
however, my left door's 4" speaker and separate tweeter are nearly shot and
I will probably replace both sides.  I will also probably add a modest
4-channel power amp to the relatively decent Alpine cassette deck.  This
will involve almost no new cabling.

>What is your esthetic opinion on the 928 S's rear spoiler?  I think it
interrupts the visual flow of the design, breaking the flow of the complex
curves of the car's rather Reubenesque rump.  Sooner or later (repaint
time... in a few years due to accumulating rock chips) I think I'll take
mine off and replace it with a body colored GTS wing.  A nice match for 17"
rear wheels with 275/40ZR's, yes?  Comments?
