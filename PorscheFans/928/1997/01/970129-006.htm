I just pulled the Splitfires out.  The electrodes looked good, slightly
brownish.  The center white porceline (?) had a distinct brown spot on all
the plugs.  I need to review what this all means.  There was no evidence of
oil and the plugs removed easily too.

Now I am running the Bosch Platinum's, gapped wide at .038 I think it was. 
The car idles smoother and throttle response is crisp again.  Maybe the
Splitfires were tired after the dyno runs?

I look forward to doing some quarter-mile runs soon at Sears Point
sometime.  I am sure the old Camaro/Chevelle/Mustang bunch will have a fun
time blowing my doors off but hope to cut a good tree at least!
