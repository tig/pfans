A guy in our area did this swap recently on a 79.  I have my car worked 
on at the same shop so I heard some of the details and am familar with 
his car.  It is used for PCA track events and has a bored oversized euro 
2 valve motor with race cams, headers, free-flowing exhaust, suspension 
upgrades, big brakes, etc.  It puts out over 300 hp and managed to wreck 
two previous transaxles - synchros failed and it wouldn't go into 1st.  
Thus the need for a swap to an 89 5 speed transaxle.  The mechanic who 
did it said it was not easy and involved putting in a shorter torque 
tube and a late model "Weissach" axle. I asked what all this cost and he 
mentioned "thousands".  So, if you can do the work yourself or intend to 
turn your vehicle into a track car it might be an option. Otherwise, 
just rebuilding your old transmission when needed would probably be more 
cost effective for a street car.
