Okay, I've stood by silently and watched all this for long enough.

I do Wheel Enhancement's ads. (I used to do Robert W. Wood Inc's ads)

I have known Robert Wood for about 8 years.

He sold the company that bears his name several years ago and retired. He
un-retired about 6 months ago and went into business as Wheel Enhancement
with John Brown, a tire expert.

Currently, you will either talk with Robert or John when you call. 7/8 of
the time, it will be Robert.

Nobody knows more about Porsche Factory wheels in North America, IMHO, than
Robert. He is ethical and meticulous and comes up with some extraordinary
deals from time to time. If anyone at Wheel Enhancement says he is Robert,
you can count on it.

OTOH, if you call "Robert W. Wood Inc." and somebody says they are 'Robert
Wood', that's another matter entirely...
