I would say unless you're used to driving Ferraris, the performance 
would be pretty amazing to most people.  Under 5 seconds 0-60 is
my guess if the automatic makes it in 5.4 as someone claimed.

The cost of ownership must be high.  I have a S4, which is a 
step or two down from the GTS and I've probably spent $3000 on it in 
a little less than two years (might be a little more than that if I
think about it - but who wants to think about that?! ;), not including 
gas and tires.  I did some stuff myself also.

But since the GTS is newer, this may not be the case yet, as my car is 
around 10 years old.

Also consider that there were a limited number of GTSs made in the world 
(in the hundreds I believe, anyone know the exact number?) so this makes 
parts inherently higher.  The low number of cars shipped (less than 100 
in 95 in the US is what I read) was one reason the 928 was discontinued.
It's a shame though - maybe with more marketing/push from Porsche we
could have had the 6 liter 400 hp Devek car made at the factory today - 
with a 6 spd maybe?!   I can only dream ;)
