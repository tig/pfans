     I remember thinking that it was weird that the '87 was slightly 
     slower than the '85 considering the increase in power as well as 
     the slightly shorter effective gearing resulting from 
     lower-profile tires.  The '87 did have higher rpm for peak torque 
     and horsepower which could certainly affect low-speed 
     acceleration.  As I had mentioned, the '87 did eventually pass 
     the '85 at about 100 mph.  Also, these numbers were for the 
     automatic, which would be more sensitive to the loss of low-rpm 
     torque in the '87 than the 5-speed would be.  In those same C&D 
     tests, the '87 5-speeds were faster in just about all of the 
     acceleration tests than the '85 5-speeds.  It's possible that the 
     automatic they tested just happened to be a dog, relatively 
     speaking.
     
     >Also, I believe (correct me if wrong GTS automatic owners if

     Nope, I checked my issue of C&D again, and the GTS they tested 
     (issue dated 11/92) was definitely an automatic.  The article was 
     a comparison test between the GTS and the BMW 850i, and they had 
     both cars equipped with automatics.  You are correct that the GT 
     model from previous years was only available with a 5-speed, 
     although the S4 was still available as an automatic with the 316 
     hp rather than the 326 in the GT.  If you can get 0-60 numbers in 
     the low-5's with a GTS automatic, though, who needs a 5-speed?
