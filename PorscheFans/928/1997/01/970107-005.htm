   ** Yes, i believe this is correct

   **  I believe the first year was '93?  i believe hp & torque were about 350 and 350 ft/lb vs. 316(326 for 
the GT) and 310 ft/lb. While i don't know 0-60 or 1/4 mile times for the GTS, i don't think the difference is 
more than 3 or 4 tenths of a sec. Me thinks the factory figures for the S4 & GT were 5.7s 0-60mph and 14.0s for 
the 1/4mile. Cosmetically the GTS went to the nice 17" "open spoke" wheel design, body colored read wing, and i 
think the fenders were also flared more to accommodate the larger wheels.
