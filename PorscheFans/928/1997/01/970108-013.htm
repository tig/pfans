Understood.  Judging against other cars (with same battery location,
albeit 12 yrs newer) that don't display this effect.  Seems like
Porsches' have a weird ground thing or maybe too much electronics?  I
guess the test will be when I hook up a known good meter - and clean out
the pod connections!

Good suggestions.  I have been considering doing the 'StreetWires'
upgrade due to the new stereo equipment.  The gold plated terminals
might be a little excessive though! My amp is double-fused and direct to
battery.  I'm going to try one of those 1000amp dry cells (the
"SPL1000").  It's compact, weighs 25lbs. and lists for $119 or so.  At
least it doesn't have those freaky graphic stickers on it.

ps. I gave up on the new water temp gauge due to sender prob's.  Read
the factory computer monitors water temp so no changes!  I am still
thinking about the 1hp gain for every 10 degree air temp drop but
haven't cut my hood yet... but I noticed that the aluminum ram tubes get
pretty hot.  have you tried wrapping them with any measurable results?
