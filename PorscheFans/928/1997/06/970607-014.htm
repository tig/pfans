Don't do it. I thought the same thing, but the powder coating is too thick
for thin strips like trim. I had it done, then spent a week of evenings
sanding it all off. It is very, very hard. I had no other choice since acid
dipping to remove it would also liquify the aluminum trim itself. I also
had the mirrors powder coated and, for that application, powder coating was
the correct choice.

My recomendation is that you have the trim pieces re-anodized. It's simple,
inexpensive and doesn't change the size of the part.

There was a post a few days ago which mentioned that the original Porsche
replacement parts for the rear side windows are inexpensive. If your pieces
are bent, dented or scratched, you may want to price out new ones.
