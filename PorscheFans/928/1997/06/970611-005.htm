Would it be that bad for the pump if you run straight water only for
the race event??  (This was recommended to me by my mechanics who
also build race 944)

I would like someone to explain to me what is there to lubricate
in the water pump.  I heard the argument that the antifreeze contains
lubricant and I am not arguing that fact however, the pump bearing
is of the dry type (sealed as a matter of fact) so what are we
lubricating??  You do not need to lubricate a water well pump so why
do car pump need lubrication??

Well, I am still confused...
