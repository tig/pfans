Paul,
I would, and so would other knowledgeable 928 Fans (and the owner I, hope). 
Even if he made those changes the car would still have the narrow rear 
fenders instead of the flared out fenders of a GTS. Also ever notice that 
the GTS rear wheel opening is round like a tire all the way around the lip 
and how all lesser ( in year model only) 928s have an almost straight 
section on the top of the rear fender lip opening. Plus what about the 5.4 
Liter thumper engine among others things. An "S4" is and will always be an 
"S4", a 928S will always be a 928S, a 928 will always......, well you get 
the picture. Just look at the registration and title. I have an "S4" and am 
proud of it. We all should be proud of the 928 models we have. That doesn' 
t mean we can't improve things the way we like , but in doing so we should 
not try to be what we are not.(lets all put "whaletails" on them and call 
them 911s, NOT).
Also remember this , if you ever try to get top dollar for your 928 
someday. (hopefully like me to buy a "REAL GTS") The educated 928 buyer 
will not pay top dollar for a modified "look alike" , but will pay top 
dollar for an original unaltered example of the "Breed".
