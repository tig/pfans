	I called up the "Porsche Customer Committment Group" in North America to
find out about this because I'm very interested, too.  The woman I spoke to
said CDROMs maybe available in Europe.  She said there might be information
about this in a European magazine called "Christophorus" (spelling?). 
Anyway, she's sending me subscription info about this mag.
	I also checked the German Porsche website (http://www.porsche.de), but its
under construction :-(  What I'd really like to see is the manuals on a WEB
page.  Thats the ultimate in cheap and easy document distribution
(especially if you publish a web site already!).

	Here is another possiblity:  ALLDATA's repair database. 
(http://www.alldata.com/pro)   Their "Series 500" cdrom set might include
porsches, but their "consumer" edition does not.  I think you might have to
buy their "special" computer to get the CDROM set tho :-(
