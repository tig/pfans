Well, I am online so might as well answer again.

Just for curiosity, what units are you talking about with 45 in. all day
long??

I will check through old message for how to check the sensor.  In the
mean time,
if you have the factory book, look on pages 87-124 and 125.  They
discuss temperature
sensor (but this was a quick scan of the microfiche so might not be the
right procedure)

Hope this helps,
