I took a slightly different approach...

i used two, two channel amps; mounted one on the back of each rear seat,
with all the cables hidden under the carpet to keep things looking neat and
tidy and to allow the seat to fold easily without pinching any of the
wires;  Looks fairly impressive when finished, as long as you don't mind
showing off a little, but then considering the type of car that you own i'd
say that's probably a given.  Mounting the amps on the back of  the rear
seats took up minimal space in the cargo area, and if i really want to hide
them i can use the cargo cover...  I just couldnt bring myself to put in a
raised floor and lose all that room.  Oh, and for those purist concerns,
all that would remain after removing the amps would be a few small holes in
the carpet on the back of the rear seat, which would not be noticable and
would be hard to find even if you knew they were there...
