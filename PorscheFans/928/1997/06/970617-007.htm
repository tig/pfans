Matt,

  Based on information that I've only recently learned, you would be putting
  better springs on if you use the most current Weltmeister kit that is
  available from Automotion.  This consists of progressive rate springs for
  both the front and the rear.  The kit costs ~$300 from Automotion and
  has a stock number of (I believe) SP-9200.
  
  You would NOT want to get the kit that Automotion currently has on sale
  for $99 (stock number SP-9281).  I had the good fortune of talking to
  Kim Crumb over the weekend and he told me that SP-9281 is old
  technology; he was using it eight years ago!
