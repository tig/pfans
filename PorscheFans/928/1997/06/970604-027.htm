Stephane,

Hee hee hee!  Boy, did you screw up!

1.  NEVER GET YOUR WIFE TO BLEED BRAKES/CLUTCHES - ESPECIALLY CLUTCHES!

2.  Don't bleed the clutch that way - pressure bleed it.  ($15 garden
sprayer at Home Depot for the pressurizer + hose + spare cap.)

More seriously, go home tonight and try again and you'll see that the
clutch works (I'm assuming you pulled the pedal back up) unless you now
have the system full of air.  Thing is, the tube to the clutch master
cylinder is long and so it takes a while for the master to fill with
fluid again thereby letting the piston come back.

If you did fill it with air, do that pressure bleeding thing and then
wait for it to fill.  Ask me how I know all this - well, I tried the
clutch in the middle of bleeding to shake things around and get all the
old fluid out but the bleeder wasn't quite tight enough.  Exasperated
with the way the night had gone, I went to bed.  Next morning, had a
great clutch pedal.

SOAPBOX:  Always bleed the clutch when you change fluid for the track. 
The clutch system is a natural water resevoir that can corrupt your
pristine fluid.  I always dilute the old fluid in the master cylinder
resevoir by running a lot through the clutch before I start on all those
4 piston-caliper bleeders.

Hope you're not headed for divorce court (by her flowers with the $ you
saved),
