In my 85, the original speakers are ITT!!  Blaupunkt was only use to
provide the head and, I think, the amplifier.

At this point, Just look for the opening size of the speaker and buy 
a good component set, I like my Boston Pro series, and install
them in the original location.  If you want the original look, you
will have to talk to the dealer or a dismantler.

PS. Don't flame me for my speaker taste.  Sound "quality" is very
personal and I like the sound of my Boston with Nakamichi Head Unit and
amplifier...
