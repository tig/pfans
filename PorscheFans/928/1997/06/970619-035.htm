I think you are confusing Traction Control, which is an active system
sort of the opposite of ABS, and Limited Slip. LS simply minimizes the
chance that you'll get substantially more power to one drive wheel than
the other. Cars with LS can do burnouts with both rear wheels; for cars
without LS the tendency is for just one rear tire to break loose.  But
LS doesn't sense, like TC, that there is an impending wheel spin, and
do something about it. It just tries to keep the power to each drive
wheel more or less the same.  This, of course, limits slip to some
degree since it is harder to break two tires loose than one. Hence
the name.

That being said, for all I know Porsche has a thing called Limited
Slip that everybody else calls Traction Control. If so, well, sorry. :D
