Hi,

I was just wondering if there is anyone out there that have had 
trouble with transmissionfluid in the coolingwater ??

I was driving the other day an made a left turn and suddenly it was 
just like i had put in neutral, nothing happened until i came out of 
the turn then everything was back to normal. I checked the 
automaticfluid and it was empty so i filled it up but since this has 
happened once before i also checked out the water and it was a red 
mess all of it. So it was only to change radiator again :-(

Has anybody else had the same problem with "TWO" radiators ??

Cheers;
Mats
