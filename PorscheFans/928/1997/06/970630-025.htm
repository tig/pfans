Gentleman,

ALL 753 OF YOU.

I have noticed that the rear tires are wearing in the center =
excessively.   I am running the recommended pressure of 44psi.  If I use =
the logic that the relatively high pressure is causing this,  I should =
then reduce the pressure.   However, at the factory recommended =
pressures the handling is very good.  If I reduce the rear pressure to =
38 psi, one can feel the transient pitch toward the rear.  This begins =
the induction of slight oversteer.  If anyone has recommendations, =
please forward.  I really do not like to put new tires on every 8000 M. =
and I really prefer the neutrality of the chassis at the factory =
settings.

Dear Stephane,  I am using MS outlook for my E-Mail.  I have tried =
putting in CR's and it seems that netscape has a problem.  Actually, I =
am sure that it's a Bill Gates thing.  Make sure that no one but his =
followers can communicate.  Empires built.  I have put in CR's in this =
message.  One hopes they will work for you. If not, send hate mail to =
BG.

Take cares folks,

Richard Hudgins
