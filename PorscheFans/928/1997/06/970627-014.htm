  Uhhhh. . . . guys, you might want to re-read the original post.  He
didn't say "what about those folks that don't have e-mail" he said "what
about those folks that don't have WEB access."  It's possible to have an
e-mail *only* account.  No browsing -- and the HTML links wouldn't
work.  Thus, he might be able to get the list, but not access the web
site.
