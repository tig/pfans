This weekend MC Hammer's custom 928 showed up at the AutoMart in San Ramon
CA.  I raced down to see it but was too late.  One of the players from the
Raiders in Oakland had already taken it out for an extended test drive.  I
went back on Wednesday and the guy still had it.  So I've still not seen it.
However, this is the description I was given.

'85 928S.  Convertable kit job and body rework with a cost of about $60K.
The sales guy told me MC spent $150K total on the car.  They are selling it
for $42K.  I'm sure the motor has been completely reworked as well.  The
conversion was done by California Concepts in Hayward.  The back end was
widened to accept 345s (at least).  The sides have NSX style air vents.  The
interior has also been reworked but I do not know the extent.  I have a
digital camera and have left instructions at AutoMart to call me when it
comes back in.  If they call me, I'll take a few photos and put them
somewhere for your viewing displeasure.
