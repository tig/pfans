After searching for over 3 years in and around Seattle, I'm the one that
bought Cookies''90 928 S4 creampuff. Although I paid top dollar for it, I
got what I paid for. I first discovered this car through this forum. When I
went to Cookies' San Diego Porsche service site to see it, it looked like
something off a showroom floor. The car was truly immaculate, inside and
out. 30K miles on the odometer. The car was serviced and maintained to the
point of obsession. 

Accordingly, as an objective 3rd party, I'm pleased, and on my own volition,
to vouch for Cookies' integrity. If the shape of his Mercedes is anything
like the 928 he sold to me, then some Mercedes fan should quickly snap it
up. His ad, posted here yesterday, is repeated as follows:

From: Cookies@aol.com

Subject: Non Porsche vehicle for sale

A posting member bought my creampuff 90' 928S4 and brought it "home" to
Washington, now I am selling another vehicle, as my wife has her eyes on a
convertible . Vehicle for sale:
1996 Mercedes-Benz S320 SWB Sedan. White exterior/gray leather interior.
Virtually everthing except kitchen sink comes standard on this car, except,
and this car has them: power moonroof & CD player. Vehicle is absolute
showroom condition. Not a nick, scratch, mar inside or out. 23K miles. Under
factory warranty for 2 1/2 more years. Mobil 1 every 3.5K miles. Serviced
with all the book and records. As new. Purchased new @ $65K + luxury tax +
tax + license. Fees paid. California car. A wonderful purchase at only $53K.
No luxury tax to next owner :-). If you ever dreamed of a "S Class", but
thought you couldn't afford it, her'es "as new" for a wonderful price.
Suggest you drive one at MB dealer.
