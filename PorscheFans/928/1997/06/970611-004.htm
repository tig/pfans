I assume that repair money will be limited at first.  With this said,
get
the car inspected by a 928 mechanic (not just a plain Porsche
mechanic...)
It might cost you $100 up front, but it will save you a lot of problem
in
the long run.  If you do not know a good mechanic, just ask the list by
including your location.  If this fails, try to locate your local PCA
(porsche club of america) chapter.  They will prove very useful.

Any engine with a rubber timing belt will have some required maintenance
at regular intervals.  However, because you are looking at a 16 valves
engine, the failiure of the timing belt will ONLY cause you to be
stranded.
I say only because, starting in 85 witht the 32 valves engine,  a
failiure
of the timing belt will cause the pistons to hit the valves, resulting
in 
some major damage.

Ignorance only makes you a more qualified list member. The important
thing
is the quest for knowledge, 928 knoledge that is (and the santa naughty
girl
list for some of us...)
