I write:
I've just lowered mine on all 4 corners and installed the Weltmeister's
and Koni Reds.  The perches do get pretty gummed up and, since they're
aluminum, it might be wise to take them off first.  If you're autoXing,
then you'll most certainly want the springs for a mere $300 - you might
want to pass on the shocks as they're more $ depending on how yours feel
(and your wallet FTM).  Trick on removing the fronts are either 1)  (my
way) loosen the top A-arm pivot nuts so that it pivots freely, unbolt
the shock, then pivot the A-arm UP, push the lower down, and carefully
work the shock out OR 2)  (from Kim Crumb) Unbolt the lower A-arm and
remove the shock - [there's also the factory method of removing the 2
upper a-arm securing nuts - PITA].

With the shocks fully extended (wheel hanging), the factory shocks (on
my '87 S4) still produce a lot of force which would make the adjustment
pretty difficult without relieving the spring's force.  Since the
Weltmeisters lower AND stiffen, these springs are MUCH shorter when
unloaded than the factory's.  Therefore, it doesn't take much
compression on these on the car to be able to turn the adjustors.  On
the rears, I've used fairly large cable ties to hold 3-4 coils
compressed (put 'em on with a jack under the control arm) and, just
yesterday, I did some mill work (drill and hack saw would also work) to
cut some clamps into Al angle stock to hold 3 coils.  The Al clamps
worked really well on the rears to remove nearly all the spring tension
- on the fronts, I might have to take the shocks off to adjust them
(still working on this).  Certainly if you lower each front the same
amount (same # of turns), you will be no worse off than before (and
therefore will have equal motivation for checking the corner balance as
you do now - I'm pretty sure most people are not too motivated).

Alignment changes with lowering:  going nearly as low as you can go
(assuming my car started at normal height - I think so), you'll will get
~0.5 degrees more negative camber F& R and you will have to toe in about
0.5 degrees - about 1/3 of a turn on each tie rod.  I'd measure, try
this, and then correct from there.  Rear toe is unaffected.

To change camber, all recent Porsches (I believe) have eccentric
adjusters for front caster, F&R camber, and rear toe.  On the lower
control arm, near the ball joint, you'll see 2 eccentrics - one for
caster and one for camber.

On corner balancing:  I've worked through the equations on this recently
and, from my understanding of them, have concluded it's a lot less
important than I originally thought (Nomex is on now - keep the
responses collegial).  I thought an unbalanced car would act like an
uneven bar stool - a little braking would transfer a lot of weight to
the, say, left front and then just a little throttle would transfer all
that weight to the right rear.  Well, it don't work that way!  As long
as the corner balancing is close, the springs will behave linearly, and
then pitch and roll rates (changes in wheel weights) are entirely
unaffected by the corner balancing.  That said, I do believe it's true
that an unbalanced car will tend to push in right handers and oversteer
in left's for example.  I speculate that corner balancing is most
important for straight line stability (and it's toleration of alingment
errors) and for tire wear but both of these should be pretty loose
constraints.

The difficult thing about corner balancing is to have a flat surface to
work on - it can be sloped but curvature will, in general, kill you. 
I've been trying to find a way to do this at home (a la my laser wheel
alignment) and I think I'm about there but, as usual, the question gets
posted before I get to try it.  So, what I'm about to try, is to use
that nice skinny spare tire as a scale - fill it with air, mark a spot
on the wheel, and then mount it on each corner (in the same position -
see mark above) and measure the height of the rim off the ground.  The
different deflections will indicate the weight difference on each
corner.  Do it all in one uncurved spot in your driveway - first with
the car pointed one way and then the other so that you see not only the
reproducibility but also any curvature in your working surface. 
Finally, I would get someone to sit in the car to get a rough estimate
of the effective spring constant of the spare tire and, by measuring the
deflection of the chassis, the spring rates.  This way you can get a
quantitative estimate of the differences - adding a passenger or not
will create corner differences of 50 lbs on both the front and rear
axles so that doing much better than this won't be useful.
