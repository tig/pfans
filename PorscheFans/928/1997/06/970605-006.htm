  Looks like you won't need to update the master cylinder if you go with
  the Devek upgrade kit (based on the fact that they don't include one in
  their package).  Checking on whether a larger MC would provide added 
  benefit with an upgrade kit would probably be a good idea though (less
  pedal pressure(?), less PSI concentrated on stressed components(?) - I 
  don't know but bring these up for consideration).
  
  The Devek kit comes with adapters which will allow you to use the stock 
  spindles with the new calipers.  I think if you were to try the update 
  without such an adapter, you would need to upgrade the spindles and 
  everything that would encompass (ball joints, control arms, etc.).
  
  Note that you'll need an S4 alloy spare with the upgraded brakes.
