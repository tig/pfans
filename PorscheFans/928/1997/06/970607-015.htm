My 928 convertible has been called 'Miata like' more than one time. I think
the folks who say this are clearly non-automotive types. No point in
arguing with 'em, they wouldn' know the difference.

There's a Miata in the household, and it is a wonderful car. Virtually
perfect in its realization of the 'British sports car that works' concept.
But give me the rumble of the V* any day.
