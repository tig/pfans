Gentleman,

The issue about timing in the Devek catalog is relative to cam timing, =
not ignition.  They suggest advancing the cam timing, which should move =
the torque curve a little lower in the rpm band.  I do not know if this =
would be a wise move.  My experience with cam timing has been on racing =
engines only, and we had different timing on each individual engine =
which was developed during dyno testing to optimize each particular =
engine. Of course the 928 motors could be exactly perfect in all =
tolerances, airflows, etc.  Therefore, a generic cam timing could be =
used to some good effect. =20

However, LL's suggestion of having the control chips modified by someone =
with a dyno and proper MAP knowledge is spot on. This is exactly what is =
done by all current racing engine builders.=20

Take care, folks=20
