  Most likely, the plastic base plate that the leather wraps around is
  not seated properly in the plastic clips on the console.  That was the
  problem on my car.
  
  There was enough _extra_ leather on the boot that I doubt it could 
  have shrunk to the point of needing to be stretched in order to fit properly.

Subject: Wheels For Sale ('86 944 Turbo offset)
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/



     I'm selling the original phone dials from my '86 951 (REMEMBER, these 
     wheels have the '86 offset):
     
     2 7"x16" (front) and 2 8"x16" (rear) with all center caps included
     
     All 4 wheels are in good shape and have never been bent or curbed.  
     They have been on the car since delivery from the factory (only 57,000 
     miles ago).
     
     Will sell the set for $700 but will consider any reasonable offers.  
     Buyer pays shipping.
     
     If interested, please call me at:
     Work: (202) 314-1134
     Home: (703) 425-0748 (evenings and weekends only)
     Beep: (703) 423-8437
     
     Thanks,
     Ben Trapp
