	I hope this reaches everyone on time. Please try to make it to the Parts 
Heaven Swap meet this Sunday (29th). I know there are several of 928er's in 
the SF Bay Area. I know that both Phil's will be there, along with myself. 
Some of you I have met,and some of you I haven't, Madison, Mikel, Frank, 
Denet, Alan, Edmund, Derron, Gordon, and anyone else who would like to show 
support. I would like to see your cars, and get to meet you if I haven't 
already! Be sure to get there early, the last swap meet I scored a set of shop 
manuals (thanks Gordon!), Edmund would have had them if I was a minute later! 
I also bought a $149 car cover for $30 and some Weltmeister springs for $42, 
plus other goodies! I hope to see all of you out there and check out your 
cars, by the way I have never met anyone who was as much a car nut as I am, 
until I met Phil tong. Don't foget your camera Phil !!!!!  What do you think 
Phil,
 1st annual 928 Concours/Drag Race/SwapMeet/SoundOff/RoadRace/Autocross?!

Hope to see everyone!
