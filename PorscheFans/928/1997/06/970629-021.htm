Hi,

I was corrected on my reference to the BMW line of cars as Beemers. 
From 1986 to 1990 I sold BMW',Jags,Porsche,Mercedes and most everything
else that went fast and handled well.  Up here in the Pacific NW I NEVER
heard a BMW called a Bimmer.  They were called Boomers and Beemers but
never Bimmers.  I have never even heard the nickname for the bike. 
However!  The BMW is a very nice but somewhat overpriced/overrated
automobile with a loyal following.  I sold a lot of them to folks that
were very happy with them.   Go Bimmers!!!! 

928 and 911's FOREVER!!!!!! LET'S KEEP THE 928 PAGE TO THE 928 

TIMING BELTS

I would like to ditto the comments on the 1k mile belt check, PLEASE DO
IT.  I go one step farther when I do a belt or waterpump, I use only the
Porsche belt.  Someone makes the belt for Porsche and I am sure they
market them under EuroSelect or some other off brand but I just don't
feel comfortable if it doesnt say Porsche on the box.

ps: Just bought some rear rubber from DEVEK.  Firestone Firehawks-Great
tread pattern for the rain in the NW.  Got  a GREAT price from Susan,
Check it out.  

BEST REGARDS TO THE LIST,
