Okay, everyone has assured me that I will have no problem fitting my
bulky bod into a 928. I especially like what someone mentioned about
there being several choices of seat mounting holes, so you can
nominally position the seat far or near, then use the usual adjustments
for fine tuning. That is a neat feature.

I would still like to drive or at least ride in one soon, so that I can
be sure I will like it before expending a lot of time and energy
looking for one. I have been in a 928 all of once, and that was 12
years ago, when I was working at an auto parts store. All I did was
help a customer change a fuse.  :^D

But I think I will like it.

Thanks.
