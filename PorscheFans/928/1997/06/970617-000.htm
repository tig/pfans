Leonard, I'M confused now.  My US car lacks driving lights (as do all 928s'
I thought) doesn't it?
Or was the a change with the S4 model?

On the very outer edge are the direction signals, next the parking lights
and then "fog" patterned lights.  In my fog lights I also have 100w
elements also but what is really confusing to me is what you said about the
"928 high beams are accompanied by the driving lights".

In the US there is another law (so I thought...I'm no lawyer) prohibiting
fog lights being on at the same time as high beams.  So when I go to high
beams, the fog lights shut off like all the other factory installed fog
light equipped vehicles sold in the States.  The only white lights that
remain on with the highs are the parking lights.

Any explanations/clarifications?
