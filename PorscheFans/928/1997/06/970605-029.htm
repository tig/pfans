I may send my car to Greece and will store it when I leave. What do I have
to do to store it. I go to Greece every 1-2 years, so the car will be
stored in 1-2 year intervals.

I already know of theses steps:

put fresh fluids in, oil, brake, transaxle
fill up gas and add stabilizer
flush radiator and add fresh coolant
remove battery
over inflate tires
wash/wax car and clean interior
clean and wax wheels
cover openings, exhaust, close heater vents
condition all rubber pieces
keep covered

It will be stored in a garage, where the temp. will average 50-60 in the
winter, and 80-100 in the summer. The climate is rather dry.

I am worried about mice setting up house in my car, as I know they can
easily chew through something as thin as those "car bags".  I have seen
people encircle the car with moth balls on the floor, surrounding the car
with a gap-less wall of moth balls in a ring of defense against
unauthorized intrusion.

Any suggestions? I know the best thing would be to drive the car every
month or so, but there is no one over there whom I trust with my keys. So
it has to be put into storage,
