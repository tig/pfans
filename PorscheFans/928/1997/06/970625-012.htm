I suppose it would depend on the nature of the leak. When you say that
the tube is the problem, is it that it is 1) cracked, 2) so corroded it
is falling apart, or 3) just has a pinhole? If it is 1 or 3, you might
be able to weld the bad spot. Aluminum is fairly easy to weld, I
understand.

AC fittings are fairly universal - it is possible that an AC guy could
fabricate a new one for you, using generic fittings and rubber AC
hose.  I know this is not the most aesthetically pleasing option.

It's pretty rare for those aluminum tubes to leak - is it leaking at a
fitting? If so, all you may need is a new o-ring or gasket.

What is aluminum putty? Bear in mind that while running, the low side
is still going to be in the 25-35 psi range. Once you shut off the AC,
the high side and low side will equalize, and the low side can get well
over 100 psi. Aluminum putty, or JB Weld or whatever, would have to be
pretty strong. I'm not saying it isn't, just that you have to remember
that the low side is not 'low' all the time.

An aside - one thing I've noticed about stuff like JB Weld, it works
well if you really clean the surface it's going on. I mean CLEAN. The
metal should be bright from the brushing you've given it. If it's not
clean, you might as well be using spit.

Anyway, it sounds like the liquid line, which is on the high side.

Don't get me started.  :^D

Be sure to use refrigerant oil on all the threads, gaskets, and o-rings.

(I used to fix auto AC's as a side job)
