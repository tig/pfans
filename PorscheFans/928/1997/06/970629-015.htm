Dear Brian,

A very busy week prevented my immediate reply to your e-mail - sorry
about the delay.

I still propose that the BMW 850 holds its resale value better than my
'90 750iL did or your '87 928S4 does.  Of course, without hard numbers in
front of me, I can say that the 750 and 928 are affordable to me (I'm
pursuing purchase of my first 928) while the 850 has continued to be
elusive.  I don't consider Jaguars and Audi to be anywhere near the class
of a BMW, Mercedes or Porsche, however I do like my friend's Jaguar
Vanden Plas Majestic very much along with the new XJ8, I've owned a nice
Audi K70 and I really like the A8 Quattro - there may be one in my stable
some day.  I am not that excited by Mercedes, but really the main reason
is that my lousy lower back isn't properly supported by a Mercedes seat.

I'm not aware of a $140K version of an 850, however, BMW does have a
factory division that will customize any BMW you wish, any way you wish -
so I'm sure that is possible to order a $140K 850 from the factory (gold
plated shifters and Barney colored rugs with bullet proof glass are
possible for those with too much money).

Ok, here are some facts (MSRP - NADA 07/97 - %)

1997 850Ci    $94,300 - $NSF
1997 840Ci    $75,300 - pretender
1996 850Ci    $93,300 - $66,925 - 71.7%
1996 840Ci    $74,400 - pretender
1995 850CSi  $99,900 - $66,250 - 66.3%
1995 850Ci    $88,050 - $55,725 - 63.3%
1995 840Ci    $69,900 - pretender
1994 850CSi  $98,500 - $61,850 - 62.8%
1994 850Ci    $85,500 - $51,450 - 60.2%
1994 840Ci    $68,100 - pretender
1993 850Ci    $83,400 - $43,375 - 52.0%
1992 850i       $78,500 - $36,100 - 46.0%
1991 850i       $73,600 - $33,000 - 44.8%

I have always liked the water cooled 928 far more than any air cooled
Porsche - I find it hard to get excited over a car that sounds like (and
looks like) a large vacuum cleaner (undeniably, the fastest vacuum
cleaner on four wheels).  Besides, the 928 is still one of the best
looking cars ever designed !

Yours,
Christopher Koch
Buffalo, New York

PS.  While I did have hydraulic and mechanical problems during my several
years of 750iL ownership, the only electrical ones were caused when an
errant  440VAC line hit my car and did considerable electronic damage
(about $7800 worth of parts alone).  My car was parked in a client's lot
when a tractor-trailer truck decided to take a short cut through - and
pulled down half a dozen electrical poles !  My flawless 750iL was of
course the only car hit...

PPS.  I certainly enjoy hearing about all the 928 experiences in the
Digest.  I will be in the southern San Jose area from August 9th thru
17th to enjoy the Pebble Beach Concours and hope to be able to meet some
of the many 928 aficionados there to learn much more about this beauty. 
Perhaps, I might be an owner of my first one by then?
