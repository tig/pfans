  Another possibility is that a wire has broken within the insulation
  between the speedo and the connection at the other end.  Try taking
  the speedo off and checking the resistance (or maybe voltage signal -
  not sure - anyone know a good E.E.? (Dr. J.C.C.W.?)) as you move the
  wire from the "hanging" position back into the position that it would
  take if the speedo was back in the cluster.
