If I use the logic that the relatively high pressure is causing this,  I should then reduce the pressure.   However, at the factory recommended pressures the handling is very good.  If I reduce the rear pressure to 38 psi, one can feel the transient pitch toward the rear.  This begins the induction of slight oversteer.  If anyone has recommendations, please forward.  I rea

Richard, Thank you for trying but what can I say, you are using
a microsoft product...

As for the tires, I wish I could help.  The only thing I could 
suggest is to check the alignment and the height adjustment.  Maybe
a combination of adjustment and pressure would solve all you problem.

Or maybe I could be the a little bit more helpful and tell you
what the magical combination is :-(

If you are a PCA member, why not submit this question to Pano and
see what Kim Crumb suggest...  Or just give him a call, his number
is in Pano and, by indicating that you will post the answer here, 
you will be helping 754 people.
