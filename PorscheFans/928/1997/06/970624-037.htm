After about two weeks of 'test driving' my new toy - A new noise! It is
a nasty squeaky/rattly noise that emanates from the rear driver side. I
immediately decided it was an exhaust noise - so did other more
discerning ears. Just to be sure it wasnt a bearing or spider gear or
something nasty I had my mechanic look at it while he was working on
something else. He Verified it was the exhaust, and his man made a
custom reinforcement bracket which DID NOT WORK. the problem here is
that the front of my muffler ( A bulky cube shaped ANSA or something )
was hanging loose - they believe that to be the source of my evil. Since
their bracket didnt work, I spend some time at muffler shops and
eventually ended up with a taiwanese 'generic' pipe hanger with a rubber
'grommet' to eliminate contiguous metal to metal contact and introduce
the correct rubber o-ring style hanger. Am I going to have people like
(my mechanic) laugh at me when they see it? (Ps - I'll know in a few
days if it solves the problem.. right now I'm overhauling my ignition
system)
