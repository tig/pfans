That's where I found mine. Then when the transmission came apart it took 
quite a study of the parts microfiche before I discovered where such a part 
could have come from. Double checking proved my suspicions. The spring is 
easy to miss as once broken it appears as if its nothing more than a shim 
or spacer.

Quite the contrary, I found. With the broken spring you need the extra 
pressure to the left to ensure a no-grind shift.

Differs for some people. I couldn't shift mine for anything without a grind. My Friend-The-Corvette-Nut (and damn fine engineer and mechanic nothwithstanding) had no trouble shifting at all. He thought we were in for an easy rebuild. New seals, gaskets, syncros.

Afterwards he had three comments,
1) "I don't know how in the world that ratty transmission was as 
   quiet as it was." Chips off the reverse gears damaged all the main 
   bearings, including the $700 main pinion bearing assembly.
2) "I have never taken apart a factory differential that was as well 
   aligned as that one. And after 78k miles. And rarely are the custom 
   rebuilds aligned so well." He's used to Corvettes.
3) "Other than the $700 pinion bearing assembly (got it for $560 on
   discount), all the prices were in line with what I'd expect to
   pay for Corvette parts."  Actually, I bought all the parts.
