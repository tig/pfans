Greets,

It seems time to get my wheels painted.  Since I'm on a budget, I would
like to do this myself.  My buddy and I have done his M3 rims and it
worked out pretty well.  This leads me to believe we can do the same
with my rims.  My problem is that I do not have the ability to NOT drive
my car as it is my daily driver (and the motorcycle is in the shop). 
With this in mind, I am in a position where I need to
purchase/rent/whatever a rim to use while I paint my set of rims.

I would also like to get a rim that looks like my other rims.  I have
the flat OEM rims.   Does anyone have a rim that I could rent/purchase? 
It does not have to be perfect as I only need it temporarily.  Silver
would be the preferred color.  I will pay all costs including shipping. 
I have the spare tire but who wants to ride around on that?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  (BTW: I can pay a deposit)

Thanks.
