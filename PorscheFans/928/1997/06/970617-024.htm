This is some old info from a different car but it might apply here.

My friend had a 2.0 Prelude Si and installed the supertrapp on it.  He 
found that if you remove all the disk (? the max performance setting) he
would feel an increase in power but the noise was just too much for
anything
but short drive.  If he put all the disk in (12 if I remember) the thing
was 
almost as quiet as stock but with no performance increase.  He opted for
6 disks, being as loud as he could tolerate on long drive and could feel
some performance increase.

If you go to the 2 cat system, I recall that our exhaust system have an
equalizer pipe (right term?) between the 2 manifolds just in front of
the catalyst.  I recall that this is an old trick that makes a
significant 
performance increase (or was it a significant noise decrease without any
power lost).  Well, I am too confuse to keep going.

Hope this helps a bit...

Fuel filter can be found behind a pannel at the rear of the tank (ie
between
tank and bumper).  Need to remove 1 or 2 bolt to get the pannel off.
