<<I thought the Viper blew the 911 TT's doors off in many of those tests,
wasn't it 7 out of 10 or something?  That was the shocker for me!  I like the
Viper for what it is (you think the 928 is big to drive around) but in a few
years when the Viper starts looking more like Roger Rabbit's car on steroids,
the 911 TT will still be classic and timeless. >>

I bought a 96 Viper GTS in Fla. about a month ago (to resell, not to keep),
and I rode in the first 96 911 Bi-Turbo that Bluegrass Motors (in Louisville,
KY) sold.  I can tell you all bar-none that the GTS is NOTHING compared to
the Turbo, or even the 928!!  Chrysler puts about as much care and thought
into the Viper as they do their Ram trucks.  Too much plastic in the
interior, too many Chrysler symbols everywhere, and too poor of fit and
finish for my $70K.  The Porsche is just much more refined, stable, and fun
to drive.  Completely different cars.  Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't own
a Viper.  Neither the RT/10 nor the GTS impressed me.  They are fast, but if
a manufacturer can't make a fast car out of a 488 cubic inch engine they have
problems.  Here are some specs out of the latest Car & Driver:
		0-60
Viper: 4.0 sec
Porsche: 3.7 sec

		0-100
V: 8.8 sec
P: 8.8 sec

		0-150
V: 23.2 sec
P: 23.4 sec

		1/4 mile
V: 12.2 sec @ 118mph
P: 12.2 sec @ 114 mph

		Top Speed
V: 186
P: 188

*Remember: the Viper has 488 cu. inches, the Porsche- 220 air cooled cu.
inches.  I love technology!!
