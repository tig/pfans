Thanks so much guys for the info on synthetic oil (Redline oil), I was
changing my oil every 3000-4000 miles.
As a matter of fact I just changed it this past weekend. I didn't know to
just change the filter every 3000 to 4000 miles
at 4 bucks a pop (quart) for synthetic oil @ 9 to 10 quarts, it really adds
 up. Then I don't have to worry about the oil
until 9000-1000 mile. I knew there had to be some other benefit with
synthetic oil. I also am going to try Redline next time.

Sob! Sob!, I had to have my 1986-928s towed this weekend to my mechanic, I
guess I used the kick down a little too much (hehehe).
My 1986 928s is stuck in 1st gear (automatic). The transmission works fine
but the car will not shift out of first gear. It revs up to 35mph and then
I lose acceleratiion at that point. Has anyone here experienced this
problem before. As soon as my mechanic pulls my transmission apart
I will let you know just what is up. The mechanic thinks that it is a
modulator gone bad or the modulator cable. Has anyone here had t
his experience before?  Cost 1200 big ones ($1200) well guess I'll have to
push that second 928 purchase back to summer.

High-maintenance, but every bit worth it! (hehehe)
