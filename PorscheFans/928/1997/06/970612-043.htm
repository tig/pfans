When both were stock, the Buick was faster in EVERY aspect up until the stock
chips rev limiter hit 125mph.  After that the 928 would come up like
gangbusters past 
the GN, but it had a lot of making up to do.  Both are now moderately/equally 
modified and the GN will hold it's own on up to about 145 before the 928
stops 
the GNs' pull.

The ONLY modification to the GN where I had to actually unbolt a part of
the *engine*
was to install a lower temp thermostat.  A K&N air filter was also added as
was a
test pipe on the exhaust.  Finally a Pit Bull chip finished it off.  No
NOS.  Stock
intercooler, stock turbo, stock injectors, stock fuel pump, all season
radials and 
it is still quiet, gets great mileage and is still the ultimate sleeper.
On the rear 
window I had a graphic artist put the words "CORVETTES, BREAKFAST OF
CHAMPIONS"!!!

To this date, I've been beaten by only two Corvettes and one was at the
drag strip
and he was running slicks and a blower.  The other was on I-696 in Detroit and
I have no idea what he was running other then one hell of a fast car.

IDENTICAL modifications were made to the Porsche with the exception of the
thermostat.

My 928 modified is equal to a friends Dodge Stealth Twin Turbo as well as
another friends newer Mitsu VR4 1000GT.  The Buick will smoke em all.

Now the first time I have to hit the brakes or corner the GN is another
story....
