I will probably not track the car this year :-(  so right now, I am
happy 
that my brake cannot lock up.  It should be easier to fix then my
previous problem...

The brake pad detector is simply a wire encased in plastic.  When the
plastic get worn off, the wire gets broken and the light goes on.  In
your case I would either leave the detector on and tape it to the brake
line
or other out of the way position or remove the sensor and install a
jumper
in the plug.

Couple of thing you might want to try:
	Red line water wetter: this additive has had some good review by the
list member...
	Change your coolant mixture:  The glycol we add to our cooling system
is not very good at carrying heat when compared to water.  You could
flush
your system and fill it exclusively with water if you live in an area
where there
is NO chance of freezing.  The saffer way is to go to a 60% water and
40% glycol
which give you protection for temperature below freezing and added
cooling 
capacity.  (This mixture, according to Porsche Tech Spec book, give you
protection
to -25 Celsius (-13 F)).
