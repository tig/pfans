Well, I hope everyone had a good weekend.

I something up (or down) with the list? I haven't seen anything from
our normally chatty group this morning.

I went and looked at an '86 928S on Saturday. It was a dark blue
automatic with ABS. I was somewhat underwhelmed by this particular
specimen. It had a lot of negatives - lots of sun exposure, cracked
dash, ugly paint touchups here and there, 3rd brake light hanging by its
wires, front air dam held up with coat hangers, paint faded on right
front fender but not on left or hood (repainted after a wreck?),
front-end seemingly riding really low (did it have some sort of
suspension mod?), worn tires. And so on.

On the other hand, it was my first hands-on of a 928. I still have a
grin stuck to my face that won't come off.  :^D  See?

I like this car every bit as much as I thought I would. I didn't get to
drive it (the salesman wasn't really taking me seriously, probably
because I was looking it over so critically) but I did sit in it and
start the engine. Gad, what a sweet sound. Even the starter motor
sounds good. And the key goes into the dashboard, where it belongs (as
opposed to the steering column). And I was very comfortable in it.

I was going to go look at another identical car Sunday, but couldn't
hook up with the guy. Our schedules wouldn't mesh, so we're going to
try again next weekend.

The Z-28 is in the paper, so hopefully I'll get a buyer for that soon.
