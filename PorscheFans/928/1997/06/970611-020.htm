Randy:

The simple reasons for having my Porsche "mechanic" do the job are:

1. Job was completed within two days of call to schedule, whereas
earliest appointment available with a "dealer" was a week off.
2. Cost (parts and labor) was half "dealer" cost.
3. Local "mechanic" wants my business whereas the dealers in the area
don't care one way or the other. My local mechanic usually has a loner
car, will pickup and deliver my car, etc.
4. As the local "mechanic" installed a rebuilt pump, in 1990 (after the
factory pump in the '87 928S4 gave up at 37,000 miles) and it is still
working great today (at 113,000 miles), I believe his judgement was
correct (factory vs. aftermarket).

Best regards, JW
'87 928S4 (stick, 113K)
'95 916 (Ducati)
