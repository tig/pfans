 WRONG! Get your car in NOW for retensioning!
 
 A new belt will stretch in early use and the array of authorities I respect
 recommend retensioning between 1000 and 3000 miles after installation and
 initial tensioning. The dealer may be bound by a P&L warranty on the belt
 replacement, but they will not smilingly rebuild your engine on their
 nickel when the belt suddenly slips enough to jump a tooth or several and
 valves meet pistons. Yes, the warning light will come on then, but that
 won't help.
 
 The 15,000 mile interval may be a good one for retensioning thereafter, but
 NOT for the initial retensioning.
 
 Sorry for screaming, I just can't stand to see blowhards set up trusting
 people for injury.

If the warning went on is there a chance that there will be no damage to the
engine??
