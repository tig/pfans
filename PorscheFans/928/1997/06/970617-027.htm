John,

Thanks for the window motor info...but I managed to figure it all out on my
own last night.

I disconnected the motor and gear assy from the door, dropped the window
down, slid the roller out of the track, disconnected the motor from the
geared arm, slid the motor out one door hole and the arm out another. Then I
removed the broken door handle spring mechanism (which was previously
blocked by the window glass) which was now very easy to get to.

After that, I took the case off of the motor. What looked like 4 connectors
was actually just two; each connector had a "U" shape that was logically
redundant. Maybe the point here was to have a useable tab to connect to in
the event that one of the tabs was somehow broken?  As far as the motor
itself, everything spun freely. I blew out some carbon-like deposits off of the
stator brushes and examined the circuitry. I got out a battery, some aligator
cables and a fuse and tested the motor. Everything worked fine. I re-assembled
the whole shebang and the window works great!
