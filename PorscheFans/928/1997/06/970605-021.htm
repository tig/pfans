Right. The http://www.928s4vr.com/ site is really helpful in outlining
this information. It's what helped me zero in on the late '86 as my
ideal candidate.

BTW, you're working on the FAQ http://www.apci.net/~slyjay/FAQ928.htm,
right? Keep up the good work! I can't wait to see it completed
(although FAQ's are never actually finished, of course). I love FAQ's.

Wow. That's encouraging. Maybe there's an '86 for me after all. :^D

Right. You just have to weigh all the factors before deciding if a
purchase price is a good one.

I know what you mean. I also have an '85 Honda V65 Sabre (motorcycle).
As you may know, motorcycle parts tend to be expensive, too, so I tend
to buy all my parts mail-order. I have saved a ton of money this way.
For example, new tach/speedo lenses were going to cost me $85 from the
local dealer, but I got them for $55 MO. You just have to batch your
orders so that the shipping doesn't kill you.
