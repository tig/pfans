<<I tried the "AutoThority "chips and was dissatisfied with the  performance.
 Under soft acceleration  with these chips the car hesitated when the
throttle was softly pressed.  I took them out and the problem went  away.
 Under full throttle there was a bit more 

"oomph" . It wasn't worth the trade off. >>

Roy-
You might have wanted to try a different chip- the one you were sent may have
been defective.  The AutoThority I put in my 87 928S4 helped greatly improve
power and driveability without anything like the problem you described.  As
far as mods go I would check with Devek 928 (1-800-598-0693).  All the things
they sell are tested and proven, and sure to give your 928 that extra bit of
what you are looking for.  Fuel injectors shouldn't be a problem at your
mileage either.

Univ. with a degree in clinical psych.  I now own my own business- Buxton

Two favorite quotes: "The secret of success is constancy to purpose"
-Benjamin Disraeli
and "Strive for perfection in everything.  Take the best that exists and make
it better.  If it doesn't exist, create it.  Accept nothing nearly right or
good enough." -Sir Henry Royce, co-founder of Rolls Royce

What else to tell... I don't know... ask if you are curious.  I tried to
E-mail pics of my car to be posted on the 928 web page but they wouldn't go
through.  Never had that problem before.  Anyway- until later.
