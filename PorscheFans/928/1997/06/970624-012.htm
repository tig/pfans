To all those who have questions,

I don't subscribe to this list. Subscription isn't necessary. I use the
URL: 

http://www.porschefans.com/Archives.html

This points to the archives created from all of the members. It is updated
quite often each day. Just select 928 and pick the date. If you're on the 
current date, every so often throughout the day, just hit "Reload".

Do what I did. Start with the oldest possible date archived, read everything
you can while you work your way up to the present. It's fun! You learn alot. 
So, if you're new to the 928 list, try this out. Do as much research as you can
and many of your questions will be answered or, at least refined. 

I know...it would be great if there was a FAQ. I believe that some of the
subscribers are attempting this. Phil Tong has a _great_ URL. This is loaded
with tips and tricks for 928 owners. As you read the archives, you'll come
across his URL. Bookmark that one. And pay close attention to whatever
Leonard has to say! 

It seems to me that an easy solution for answers would be a simple Perl script
"search engine" that could scan for a regular expression and return all dates
from the archives that had any messages with a match. Then one could pull up
those dates and read the thread of discussion.

Good idea?
