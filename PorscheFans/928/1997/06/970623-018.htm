<<<<Is there a "locator" service out there for 928's? I have been dying to
get my dream car: an '87 or later 928 S4. The problem is, I live in
Indianapolis and I can't find any in the local papers or auto-traders.  Since
I don't care where, geographically, I buy the car (I will travel ANYWHERE for
a cherry S4), I have been scouring the on-line classifieds.  Alas, I have yet
to find a car that fits my needs: a mechanically and asthetically perfect
5-speed for under $17,000.



A locator service would help me greatly!  Is there one out there?>>>>

Rob-
If you have missed any of my posts before I wanted to let you know that I do
auto locating, brokering, detailing, and performance upgrades- specializing
in Porsche.  I live in Evansville, IN and just might be able to help you out.
 Let me know exactly what colors (ext & int.), options, etc you are looking
for and I will find you a car within the week.  Right now there is a
beautiful 2 owner 1988 928S4 5-spd here in town that is for sale.  It is red
with full black leather int., 36K miles, never been wrecked and the only
paint work it has had was the front bumper (from a closing garage door).  The
car has the original rims plus a set of 16" gold BBS RZ's (both with tires).
 The car can be bought at a great price (around $20,000).  Call me or E-mail
me if you want to chat or for more info.
