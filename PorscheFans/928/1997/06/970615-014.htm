James,

I almost did this once.(I chickened out or got distracted, can't  remember 
which, or won't say) Physically this swap is possible,  but be "Warned", if 
you do not have a very good grasp of wiring schematics, color codes and 
basic circuit testing and tracing you could be creating your "Worst 
Nightmare". (unfortunately "Porsche" seems to have had a tendency to change 
Relay locations almost every year) To give yourself a sneak preview of the 
task pull back the passenger footwell carpet, open fuse/relay panel, remove 
lower wood piece. You will see that there are enough wires to hook up the 
Space Shuttle! Yes all the wires slip on to "spade" terminals, but what a 
"Cluster %#@!*&". Personally I do not think it is worth it, but what can I 
say I'll pull my engine out just to fix and clean up an Oil Pan Leak!

Good Luck and let us Know if you attempt this "Project".

P.S. - Why not just take some sand paper (fine) and polish your "fuse" 
terminals (and gently tweak the terminals to hold the "fuses" tighter) to 
eliminate those "Gremlins" and call it a day? (be sure to blow sandpaper 
dust out when finished)
