First, an introduction:

I'm a dealer for Red Line Synthetic lubricants.  It is NOT my day job,
though...I got into
it originally through my mechanic back in Toronto, became a huge fan,
and then started
to distribute it as a sideline business.  From that, I've become pretty
knowledgeable 
on Red Line and oils in general.

>>When using synthetic engine oil, at what interval do you replace it?
How frequently do you replace the filter?

Replace the filter at the same interval as you would with
petroleum...3000 to 5000 miles.  The filter is still going
to get crud in it.  Synthetic oil's strength is that it doesn't break
down with heat & use at anywhere near the rate
of a petroleum.  So, if you don't keep changing your filter, after
15,000 miles, your oil is great, but your filter
is clogged and your engine is starved!

Red Line recommends OIL change intervals of 12,000 to 25,000 miles,
depending on how severe the conditions
are.  Personally, I change at 12,000.  After all, filters are only $5
from 928 Int'l (special this month).

Every car I've had has been designed such that I could change the filter
without draining the oil, only losing maybe
1/2 quart or so.

>>I have read reports on this list where people opened their used
filters up to find them fairly clean.  Implies that they can be used for
longer spans of time. 

Maybe.  I think changing your filter early is VERY cheap insurance.
Also, you can't see everything the filter is
catching with your naked eye.

IMHO, Red Line is the best oil you can put in your engine.  Lots of race
teams run it, sponsored or not, even
sponsored by OTHER oil companies!  Red Line consistently beats all other
oils, synthetic or otherwise, in
independent tests (25% less friction than Mobil 1, for instance).  Red
Line Oil Corp. is mostly a technology
company, not a marketing company (Sick 50, anyone?).

If you're like me, and you want to see specs & charts & comparison
tests, go look at Red Line's web page at

www.redlineoil.com

FYI, if you have specific questions, I will try to answer them...and if
they're beyond me, I can talk to Roy Howell,
Red Line's chief chemist, and get the answers for you.
