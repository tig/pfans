1986 928S  -  A few months ago, I was shifting from 2nd to 3rd, but the gears
didn't shift...only the shift lever moved.  The shift lever felt disconnected
from the linkage.  I cycled back through the shift and it shifted.  I could
feel the normal resistance of the linkage on the second try.  Sometimes it
takes more than a couple of shifts.  I can feel right away if this will
happen just by the lack of resistance from the lever.  Usually, a cylce of
the clutch and a little jiggle makes it catch.

The diagram in the book shows a ball socket on the front of the linkage.  I
was told this was the culprit and purchased the part.  The book is not so
clear on how to change this thing, though.  Access from inside the car
doesn't look possible, and underneath is the maze of exhaust and such.  What
a pain.

Anyone had this problem and know how to get to it?

Thanks,
