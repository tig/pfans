On speakers.  IMHO the OEM speakers in my 1986 are damn good.  Perhaps =
this is because I'm not an audiophile.  I also found it was cheaper to =
replace the 5.25" midranges in the door with oem rather than comparable =
after market ones ($55 a piece).  =20

I actually fixed the midrange in my car after I had already ordered a =
new one. =20

The shifter moves with out restriction, the release button does not
work. 928-International has some replacements but I would like to know
exactly what I need.

I also need replacement speakers (8) can anyone recommend a perferred
aftermarket and give size of ea. (2 in door, 1 behind ea. seat, 1 ea.
side in rear).

I have a great RED a/t 83 944 for sale asking $6k OBO.

Thanks,
