Hi All!

I'm about to buy a 928 S, Euro, 1980. 
Because I'm not familiar with the history of the car, I would like to 
know if there are any weak spots I should pay attention to. It's the 
car of  my dreams so I'm buying with my heart instead of my mind.

I hope that this message gets to you in time, but I have neglected reading
my Digests for a few days.
I purchased a similar car that had spent almost 17 years on salty English
roads but it seemed to be genuine and pretty good, so I bought it and
shipped it back to Oz. My car did have AFN service history for all but the
last 2 or 3 years and that was a plus. Since getting it home, I have
replaced the radiator because of a leaking engine oil cooler and have tidied
up the interior a bit (PO's dodgy speaker installation). The driver's seat
needs restitching and I have a quote for Aus$100.00. I steam cleaned all of
the underneath and then applied rustproofing goop. To my amazement, there
was no rust except for a tiny bit where the handbrake cable exits under the
car. I also have replaced the clutch master cylinder and one rear wheel
bearing. The wheels were also refurbished. Things still to do are minor body
paint touching up ($500.00) and fix the pesky climate and cruise controls.
In summary, these cars are built like a Toyota Landcruiser. They are tough
and big. The original build quality is excellent and that holds them in good
steed over the ravages of time. I would love to be able to afford a new one
(if they still made them). Mine is a manual and I never thought that I would
ever say it, but perhaps an auto would be better for 95% of applications.
The engine is so strong.
I guess to answer your question more directly, the weak spots would have to
be the "luxury" items like climate and cruise control as I have noticed
quite a few Digesters have problems in this area. The cost to get a mechanic
to fix these at $50.00 per hour would be prohibitive so you have to be a bit
of a handyperson to own one of these cars without it costing too much. Also
one power mirror doesn't work and neither does the headlight adjuster;
again, luxury items.
If the car seems to run OK, not make unusual noises and is clean and
straight, it should be a pleasure to own. Just be prepared to give it some
attention here and there. Just like an Italian car.
