After digesting all your info on K&N versus Amisoil air filters - and
talking to a family friend who is a distributor for K&N, I decided to
look more closely at K&N as a viable option for my car. (especially
since I can get a reuseable K&N for HALF the cost of a throw-away
regular filter) When speaking with my mechanic - he said that he has
actually seen K&Ns catch on fire in 928s! Has anyone heard this? Heres
what I've heard so far -

Good:
K&N after 100k miles breathes better than regular filter at 0 miles.
(K&N friend)
K&N is CHEAPER and REUSEABLE for my 928

Bad:
K&N allows small particles of dirt into the engine. (You guys) - [K&N
found this in their own studies and report that the particles they found
were yes, much bigger than the ones regular paper filters allow, but no,
still not bad for your engine because they are still small]

Ugly:
K&N catches fire? (My mechanic, who seemingly would have no reason to
make that up)

Thanks for any and all input!
