Mikel, 

Congratulations, you couldn't have picked a better car for the twice daily
insanity of Route 17.  I don't know what the various strange noises
emanating from your 928 are, but I do know someone in Santa Cruz who can
probably find what they are without nailing you to the wall.  About 18
months ago I drove to Florida from  Aptos and thought that I'd replace the
shocks on my 87 S4 as the car had about 80K on it and the original shocks
were allowing the car to bottom out occasionally on hard bumps.  I took it
to Parnelli Jones in Santa Cruz and they put new Boges on.  They must have
put them on with a sixteen pound sledge hammer because the next morning all
my steering fluid was on the driveway under the car.  Naturally they denied
any responsibility and nothing would move them to admit they had messed the
car up. I didn't have time  to argue. I asked around and found a small
company called "Hennings Werkstatt Inc", a father/son operation at 116 River
St. in Santa Cruz.  I related to them what had happened and told them that I
had planned on leaving for Florida that day.  They examined the
undercarriage, and confirmed that someone had done fatal damage to the
steering rack.  They had a rack trucked in from  LA the next day and the
following morning I was on the road to Florida.  They charged me about half
the amount that the nearest Porsche dealer wanted and did it in one day
rather than the two to three weeks the Porsche wanted. 

Hope your car works out for you.  The muted whining sound could possible be
a fuel pump but best to have the car checked out by someone who knows 928s.

Gene O'Rourke
