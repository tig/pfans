  There are some sheet metal heat shields around the junction of the exhaust
  manifolds and the Y-pipe that leads to the cat.  Double check to make sure
  these are tight.  Also check out the underbelly pan just behind the grill -
  sometimes the screw holes get enlarged to the point where the pan is no
  longer secure.  There is also a heat shield above that cat which could
  make the noise you describe, although that is obviously positioned at the
  center of the car (which isn't where you're hearing the noise?).

  I paid approx $1300 4 years ago.  This included an OEM (Sachs?) 
  clutch assembly and throw-out bearing (approx $500 in parts).  After 
  looking through the workshop manuals, I might be tempted to do this job 
  myself next time.  Be warned that other members of the group have said
  that the clutch assembly is VERY heavy and some homemade metal pins are
  needed to help with alignment.
