I'm no transmission expert, I paid a friend to do mine. And mine cost more
than expected when I had to start replacing reverse gears, most every
internal bearing (one was $560), and replaced all the springs while we
were in there (cheap). Without yanking the books and studying things a
bit closer, it doesn't make any sense that you would have to replace a
shaft simply because you replaced a gear on that shaft. There were roller
bearings under all of mine, comparatively "lots of slop".

Guess I'm going to be studying my books tonight as it seems there was a
gear that was afixed to a shaft. Maybe that was 2nd. Just because its not
shown separately in the Porsche parts list doesn't mean you can't get it.
I needed new dog teeth for one gear. Not on the parts list. But PAP had
it anyhow.

Meanwhile, if you need reverse gears for your '85 transmission, I have a 
set, new in the box.
