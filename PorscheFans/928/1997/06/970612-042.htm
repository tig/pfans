Yes, it is true. When you've got to park in an old city with narrow streets
and buildings built right out to the street, you want to be sure that
oncoming traffic sees your car. Most German cars have controls to light up
the front and rear parking lights on one side or the other to accomplish this.

Porsche simplified the matter by using the turn signal lever. The same
lights which flash for signals stay on steadily when you turn off the
ignition with the switch to one side. However, you should be warned about
this by the boing-boing alert when you open the driver's door.
