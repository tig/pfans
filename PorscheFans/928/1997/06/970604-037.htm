	See your doctor! Sorry, I couldn't resist. 
	
	Anyway if Kurt's advice doesnt work, mine will. By the way, this should be in 
the FAQ.

	 The clutch system is similar to the brake system, EXCEPT, the brake system 
has a positive stop (the rotors), the clutch system is push/pull (spring 
loaded by the pressure plate). It struck me like a bolt of lightning after 
pumping 2 huge containers of brake fluid through my cluch system with no 
avail. So, I rigged up a hoakey positve stop, using the old and new slave 
cyl's face to face, compressed, and bolted together. Now the clutch system had 
a positive stop and was so easy to bleed! If you dont have an old slave cyl. 
then you will have to use your imagination, but remember how strong the 
hydraulic system is. 

	This should do the trick!
