<<When driving, there seems to be a low pitched hum from the rear of the car,
which I though might be a wheel bearing or CV joint.  Should this worry me?>>

This might be your torque tube going bad... it's a fairly complex repair, but
nothing to worry about (except for the $3,000.00 cost).  The car you are
asking about sounds like an excellent buy.  The money is right too (at least
in my opinion).  In fact, it's even low- check the car over super carefully!
 If I were you I'd snatch it up though.  I LOVE my 87 S4.  One of the best
cars made and the absolute the best car for the money.  As far as things to
check- just the regular things you'd look for in a used car.  Proper
maintenance (90K tune up and timing chain) and cosmetic care... signs of
repainting... check for engine/transmission leaks... etc.
If you have any more questions feel free to ask me.
