Jesus!  That took me by surprise too - good thing no crashola you know!?! 
Instead of going into right place/right time for everything speech which I
think you have firmly in your mind now... let's talk engines.

That's weird that your car would pop it's dipstick!  Does that indicate
excessive blowback or what?  The good news I guess is that it wasn't WFO
for very long + it was under no load.   A good dyno run lasts longer than
that and is definately under load so don't sweat too much.

Have you found out what caused your sticking throttle yet?  Dangerous until
resolved, so check it out.  This is an opportunity to learn more about your
car - performing a compression test is pretty easy, ditto for leakdown if
you have the tools.  You might also want to check belts and tension since
they may have glazed or cracked.  Bring it to a shop if you can't
troubleshoot & fix satisfactorily - there's no shame involved in FIXING
your car...

Ok, here's my similiar story:  When I was 20 with my old Z/28 (eons ago
egad) I was on a merging section of three freeways - so I nailed it big
time to blast past the traffic.  About 5 seconds into all this fun I felt
something pop and yipes - the same billowing smoke trailing the car
blinding everyone following!  The car wasn't stuck wide open and the engine
responded to throttle like nothing had happened but that smoke was just
pouring from the rear and now from the hood too!  I pulled off and it
turned out I had blown a freeze plug off the block, so it was an easy
fix...whew.  

Be careful out there,
Phil
