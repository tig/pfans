Jan,

Several things can cause this, all related to the quality of your electrical 
contacts and wire, and the location of the battery in the rear of the car.
In my experience,  the problem arises fromthe increase in electrical 
resistance in any overheated corroded electrical contact or
conductor.   You already get a significant voltage drop because of distance,
and heated corrosion sometimes aggravates the already marginal 
engineering of the electrical system.

Presuming that your battery is full sized (MB88), in good condition, and
fully charged, you need to go through every electrical contact and wire 
involved with the starter.   This includes the battery terminals, the large
battery wires (be ready to peel back the insulation and trim corroded ends),
the battery ground connection, ALL connections to the starter, terminal 14
in the 14 pole connector in the right front of the engine compartment, and
the ignition switch contacts.   

Somewhere in there you should find corrosion or burned contacts.   Clean, trim,
and/or repair as necessary.   You might even find the problem.

The problem has just come back on my own 78 928.   This time I am focusing on
the ignition switch contacts.

Sometimes a sticky starter solonoid can cause this, too.

Best of luck.

Dave
