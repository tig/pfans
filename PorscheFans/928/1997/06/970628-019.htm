There are two computers, one for ignition and one for fuel, each with its
own PROM chip carrying its rather complex program. Autosport redid both
programs and replaced both chips.

Well, let's think this through. The distributor gets its name from the fact
that it connects the output of the coil to one spark plug after another.
The rotor, which is turned by the distributor shaft at camshaft (=half
crankshaft) speed, carries the current to one socket after another in the
cap, and these sockets are wired to the plugs (scramble the wires and watch
the engine run backwards or not at all).

In pre-electronics cars, the distributor also contained a cam which
actuated a switch (called a "breaker" or "points") which controlled current
to the coil. To advance or retard the spark, the plate carrying the points
was rotated a few degrees one way or another around the distributor shaft.
This rotation, which could be done manually to set things overall and then
adjusted while the engine was running by centrifugal, vacuum, or other
means, did not move the distributor cap.

Advancing or retarding the spark was done by changing when the points were
actuated, not by offsetting the distributor cap relative to the.rotor.

With early electronic ignition systems, there were still points which were
moved for advance, but they switched a very small current which controlled
the electronics driving the coil. More recently, points have disappeared in
favor of stationary non-contact sensors and computers.

The ignition computer in the 928 is capable of calculating the time delay
equivalent to a given advance at a given engine speed, so it can work very
happily from a fixed sensor, and changes to that computer's program can
provide any advance curve desired, dependent not just on RPM but throttle
position, onset of knock, and anything else worth taking into account.

Rotating your distributors won't change advance, or do anything else good.
The only way I can imagine to trick the ignition computer, short of
reprogramming it, would be to move the TDC sensor the computer uses to know
when the crankshaft has come around. This sensor is mounted at the outside
of the ring gear, not near any camshaft.

I have great regard for Devek, but they have not so far made any moves into
reprogramming the engine control computers. Since these programs have a
huge influence on the way the engine runs, I feel that this is where you
should look to realize your engine's potential, at least once you're done
with whatever mechanical modifications (e.g., air filter, exhaust, headers,
stroker cranks) you have in mind.
