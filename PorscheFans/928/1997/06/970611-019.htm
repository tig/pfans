Hello,

I just found and subscribed to the mailing list.  I bought a 79 928S a
couple of weeks ago and I have some questions for anyone that might have
had similar problems.  The previous owner didn't have and couldn't get 
the destination papers for the car (i.e. the paperwork for legal grey market
importation)  Without the paperwork, the DMV assumes it is US spec and
therefore must have a fuel inlet restrictor and catalytic convertor
(even if it passes emission level test, which it didn't)  Is there any
way to get this paperwork from whatever government office it was filed
with (DOT? EPA?)  Barring that, how bad would it be to add a cat to a
euro car that was not designed for it?  I read in the archives a rather
long thread on disabling the air pump (which this car doesn't have) and
what it could do to the cat, I definitely don't want to add an air pump
and plumbing, too. 
The car also seems to have a major leak in the clutch hydaulic system
somewhere.  The master cylinder has supposedly been replaced, and the
slave cylinder "rebushed".  I haven't had a chance to get under the car
and look for the leak yet.  Any common problems to look out for here?
Also, there seemed to be a lot of discussion on what can be divined from
VIN numbers.  It was mentioned that all the VIN's start with WPO, but
mine seems to start with 928.  Is this a european thing? The full number
is 9289101761.  There is no sticker in the trunk.  Can I get any info
out of this?
Thanks for your help!
