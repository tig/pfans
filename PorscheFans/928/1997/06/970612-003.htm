The turn signal on these cars will remain on even when the key is not in the 
ignition. The explanation I have gotten is that in Europe, this is used as a 
parking light. The signal is left on on the curbside of the road when 
parked. I don't know if this is true or not, but sound good.

I too purchased an 84 928S as my first Porsche. It is a great car and been 
my daily driver for a couple of years. Mine had 64k at purchase. I even 
autocross occasionally with surprisingly good times.

1. I suggest when having it inspected for purchase, have the A/C checked for 
leakage. A sniffer may save you a lot of money and grief in the future. 
Freon is $30 lb and these cars tend to have leaks.

2. Make sure the mechanic looks at the ball joints. Original equipment are 
aluminum and seem to wear poorly. 70k seems to be the limit. Once replaced 
with steel, they'll last forever.

3. 84 is a good year, because as mentioned by others, 85+ are 32 valve with 
0 tolerance heads. In other words, if the timing belt on an 85 goes, so do 
the valves, probably pistons, etc. EXTREMELY expensive repairs. Of course, 
keeping the timing belt and tensioners inspected and replace when needed 
remedies this. In 84 a broken timing belt only results in replacement of the 
belt. Even with new tensioners, belt, etc, the repairs should be less than 
$250.

4. Good rubber is important. Remember, you are using relatively large tires. 
Mine has 225 x 16s all around. The least expensive are almost $100 each and 
can go up to $300. (Still not bad when compared to the 245 and up. 
Especially 17s)

Other than these suggestions, mine has been a really good car. I did have to 
put a new starter in several months ago, but I did it myself and purchased 
the sarter locally. In all, less than $200. Keep the car serviced and 
polished and it will look and run good for a long time.
