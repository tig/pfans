Ed, 2 small things:

1. What rating fuse did you use and how did you get to that value?

2. Would it be possible to put a title to your message in the future? 
It
might make searching the archive a little bit easier (and will enable
some
of the "grumpier" list member tl skip over what they don't like and not
be grumpy...)

Well, make it 3 things:
What were the symptoms of the idle control valve defect?  I also have an
85 and
would like to know what to look for in the future,

TIA,
