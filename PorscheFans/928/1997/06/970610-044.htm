I'm rebuilding the tranny on my 85' 928 S R.O.W. Second gear would grind
terribly, and I would just have to throw it into third, skipping second.
Kevin Saltzman over at Randolph Racing in Stoughton, MA took it apart and
is going to replace all the syncros, but noticed one potential bank-buster.
The depth or spacing between the syncronizer and the gear is very minimal,
and said that if it is still so after the syncro replacement, second gear
would also have to be changed. In doing so, he said the counter gear and
intermediary shaft also have to be changed, sinced they are matched and you
can't interchange them. This will bring the rebuild cost from $1,200 to a
whopping $3,600.

Of course I was shocked, in a second I learned that I may have to shovel
out *three times more* for my rebuild.

 Now, I think Kevin is a really great guy, and I like to think that he is
trustworthy, but can someone (who knows what they're talking about)
*please* tell me if this is all true, or am I (and my wallet) about to be
taken for a ride?

Thank you very much,
