Fellow Fans:

I had a very interesting weekend!  I found my next 928!  To be exact, an
extremely clean red/tan 87S4 with only 36,000 miles.  I've been sitting here
for months reading about the differences between the 16v and the 32v and
never thought there could be that much difference.  Boy was I wrong.  So,
I'm having it checked out by Barrier Motors (Porsche Dealer) in Seattle, and
I need to sell my beloved 81:

FOR SALE:
81 US Spec, ivory white with the "tootsie" brown interior, 85,000 original
miles, 5-speed, Momo Sport steering wheel and shift knob, BFG Comp T/A
Tires, wider (8") updated rear wheels, tinted windows, CD and MB Quart
speakers but needs an amp for sound, brand new front spoiler, recent service
(75,000 miles):  timing belts, engine hoses, engine seals, AC fix, tune up,
etc., Valvoline synthetic every 3,000, red line tranny fluid, K&N Filter, no
dents but paint chipped in a couple places.  Drives and runs great.

I have put ALOT of time, effort, money, and blood into this car, so I hate
to sell it, but I think that $8,000 would be a reasonable price.  Since I
have had so much luck with the PorscheFans list (my girlfriend thinks I am
truly crazy to read this thing every day), this is the first place I will
list it and will take  $7,000 because I live in Moscow Idaho which might as
well be the end of the world!  Please E-mail me directly, or call.

Thanks A Bunch,
