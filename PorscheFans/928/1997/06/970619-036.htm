James,
I get this as well and it is very annoying.  Did this guy move out of the
country or what?  You have to have something like 1000 E-mails for your box
to be full.  Makes no sense to me.  Maybe he's just been out in the garage
admiring his 928 and has forgotten to check his E-mail.  Could happen.  My
girlfriend often gets mad at me for giving more attention to my automobiles
than to her.  This has the potential for many, many responses!  I can see the
bandwidth now!!
