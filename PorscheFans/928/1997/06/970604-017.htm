No offense at all.  You were close.  the entire brake system was open. 
The only
thing still standing was the master cylinder.

Your advice on the O-ring should be taken seriously on the master
cylinder.  Except
if your o-ring are brand new, you MUST change them as they will not seal
and
leak like crazy.  My car being an 85, there is NO WAY my o-ring would
seal again.

I think Aqualux was in the netherlands (might be wrong, often am).  He
was the
one which had a fuel problem resulting in his car catching on fire
(memory don't
fail me know...)
