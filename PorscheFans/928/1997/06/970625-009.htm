Alan,

I was loosing freon in my 84 S to a point where a recharge would last about
3 months.  I took it to my mechanic (Matt at Targa in Austin Tx).  He used a 
sniffer and located the leak in the aluminum tube that
runs down the right side near the radiator.  He replaced the same and
recharged the system for about $450.  This was last summer.  The Air still 
works great now, so he obviously fixed it.

>Turns out I'm loosing freon-no big deal or so I thought.  Had the system leak
>checked with a "sniffer" and lo and behold, it's not leaking from a rubber
>hose, or the compressor, but rather from that mother of an aluminum tube
>which runs from the  front of the engine compartment all the way along the
>passanger side and on into the firewall and evaporator!  I don't even want to
>think what is involved labor wise to remove and replace that tube let alone
>purchase a new one.  Two questions:
