Leonard:

What kind of horror stroy did you read in a posting? Please be specific.

I have had my car serviced at T&D, and think they did a great job. It was a
major service, both brakes, and tons of little things. They found an intake
leak that cost my car a lot of engine power, and that the local Fremont
Porsche dealer had not found when the PO had the car in for service. 

The only thing they were not able to fix was the intermittendly failing power
door lock on the driver's side: the problem never occurred while the car was
there (in the meantime I found out it doesn't fail in warm/hot weater - it
was warm when the car was at T&D, and they kept the car inside at night).

I have never heard anything bad about T&D - other than they are not exactly
cheap. The shop is always perfectly clean, and Tom (the owner) and his
mechanics seem very knowledgable. Actually, a former 928 (now Boxster) owner
plus the mechanics that maintain my other car, recommended T&D as the best
shop in the area.

P.S. I followed your advice on tires partly by getting new Conti's for the
rear - and they're wonderful! I had all tires accu-balanced, and the car is
so much quieter and smoother now. I really have to get rid of those Dunlops
in the front...
