Hi All!

I have received a couple of queries about the headlight relays and wiring
that I spoke of recently. I thought that I would answer through the Digest.

I used two relays. The "normal" Bosch 30 amp type (about 1" cube). One relay
for low beam and one for high. I got my battery feed from the "Emergency
Starting Terminal" near the radiator, ran it through a "5mm" cable and 30
amp fuse to the relay contacts. I then totally rewired the lights with "4mm"
cable, for both high and low beam, straight to the relays. I located a major
earth point in front of the radiator and used this as the return path, again
using "4mm" cable. The original wires to the driver's (passenger's for LHD)
side headlight were insulated and tucked away safely (for future use?). The
original wires to the passenger's (driver's for LHD) side headlight were
used to operate the appropriate relay coil with the earth from that loom
sinply cut off. I could replace the original fuses with low current ones as
they now only operate a relay coil (next time I have the passenger's
footwell apart). For your information, Australian auto electricians
typically use "3, 4, 5 or 6mm" cable. This measurement has nothing to do
with the actual wire. "3mm" cable is 16 strands, "4mm" is 26 strands, "5mm"
is 41 strands and "6mm" is 65 strands where all strands are 0.3mm copper wire.
