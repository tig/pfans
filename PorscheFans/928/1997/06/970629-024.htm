Hi PorscheFans:

I woke up at 0400 and started to drive.  lt was a long drive from So =
Lake Tahoe, CA but I couldn't bear to not go and see if I could get the =
few parts I need to get my 81 928 going.  Sure was glad to be there and =
see some real 928's, Don't get to see to many here at the lake.  I =
picked up most of the goodies I needed.=20
My question today is  about the little plastic pointed part with about a =
3/8" ball on the end of it that keeps the bottom of the headlight from =
moving. Does it come  in different lengths?,  I bought a headlight from =
Easy and it had a broken one.  Well I put the one on from my old light =
and it points the light down to much, it is about right if I don't push =
the little ball into its socket. =20
Thanks from Tahoe, I'm looking forward to the next swapmeet.
