It's a little more complicated (surprised?). Euro 928s always had 8" lamp
housings with no chrome ring (don't worry, Larry, the water goes right
around the lamp housing and out the drain), but those cars came with H4
bulbs. The "H5" or 9004 bulb, which is indeed what comes in '87+ 928s, is a
perversion of the good old H4 to meet the US requirements which replaced
the prior insistence on sealed beam units. The new rules require
extra-sharp cutoff of the low beam so that oncoming traffic won't be dazzled.

This is why H5s, even very powerful ones (I run 80/100 W units) die when
you dip; the high beam is essentially the same as the H4's, but the low
beam is crippled. However, in fairness, remember that the 928 high beams
are accompanied by the driving lights (100 W bulbs in mine), so a lot fewer
watts are being delivered on low beam.

Properly aimed headlights with H4 bulbs will not dazzle traffic, as those
who operate cars so equipped in the US (you know who you are) can attest,
but H4s don't meet US regs. The new discharge lamps (not the silly "ion"
lamps which have gotten a lot of bandwidth on this list) do meet US regs
but have sophisticated optics to make sure that a lot of light is put
everywhere light may be put. However, no 928 model was built with these, so
it's an engineer-it-yourself proposition to fit them.
