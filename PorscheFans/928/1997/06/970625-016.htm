  I have to wonder if this is related more to the crankcase breathing 
  flaws of the early model 928s rather than the K&N filtering medium.
  At high RPMs, early model cars were known (according to Devek) "to pump
  oil up into the breather tower and intake tract."  If one surmises that
  owners who run their engines at these revs are also likely to install 
  a K&N filter because of the slight performance increase, then the
  relationship between the K&N and the fires _may_ be coincidental since
  the oil in the intake tract is more likely to be the cause of such fires.
  
  FWIW, I've attached a copy of a "study" on reuseable filters.  I found
  it on a BMW newsgroup 
    (http://www.diac.com/~cguy1/bmw/text/summaries/PerformanceInc.html)

Readers,
A recurring question among many riders who do their own maintenance is
what about alternatives for consumables such as air and, oil filters
which we all go through so often. The following is a discussion of
air filters and their efficiencies put together from a number of
internet postings. Most of the hard information comes from Ed Hacket
along with questions from others. (note that the standard filters
which our dealers sell are paper, unless you have the K&N which is 
oild gauze and rated as plain gauze.)

Here's the info I have on air filter performance. Tests were done by
Amsoil using SAE J726C Test Method 5-best --> 1-worst

                               Oiled foam    Paper   Oil bath   Gauze


Large particle efficiency           5          5        5         4

Small particle efficiency           5          4        1         2

Airflow capacity                    5          2        3         5

Dust holding capacity               4          2        5         2

Load up charactaristic              4          1        5         1

Backfire charactaristic             3          2        5         3

Cleanability                        4          1        4         3

As you can see, K&Ns are great for airflow, which is what they were 
designed for. Their original application was on racing engines, where 
airflow is important and ultimate engine life was of little consern. They 
are not as good at filtering as paper or oiled foam types.

question > What constitutes oiled foam? Who makes one?

Uni filters are oiled foam.

quest > After the first time Ed posted this, I went searching for an oiled foam
quest > filter for the PD. Uni doesn't make one (at least that's what I've been
quest > told). Does anyone know where to get one to fit the R's (flat of 
course)?

My room mate found a listing at a local shop that specializes in dirt 
bikes. They have the full Uni catalog. All three BMW types were listed 
(round and flat R, and K). The listings in Hap Jones, Parts Unlimited, 
ect. don't have the BMW listings.

He is thinking about ordering one as he says he definitely gets more fine 
dirt downstream of the K&N than with a stock BMW paper filter. He will 
only get it if it has a solid frame like the stock filter. Without the 
frame he feels installation and getting a good seal would be damn near 
impossible.

I received this on the Ford Probe mailing list. I figured you all might be
interested, especially those of you using high-flow air filters.





     Subj: K & N filters

     John: If I wrote "subjective" I meant "objective".. I was responsible
     for evaluating re-usable air filters for a major construction/mining
     company that had hundreds of vehicles ranging from large earthmovers to
     pick-up trucks and salesmen's cars. This study was embarked upon due to
     the fact that we were spending upwards of $30,000 a MONTH on paper air
     filters. Using them one time then throwing them away.. I inititated
     the study in that I was convinced that a K&N type filter or oiled foam
     would save us many dollars per year in filter savings, man hour savings,
     and of course engines as these would filter dirt better than paper.
     (yes, I had read the K&N ads and was a believer)

     Representative test units were chosen to give us a broad spectrum from
     cars right through large front end loaders. With each unit we had a
     long history of oil analysis records so that changes would be
     trackable.

     Unfortunately, for me, every single unit having alternative re-usable
     air cleaners showed an immediate large jump in silicon (dirt) levels
     with corresponding major increases in wear metals. In one extreme case,
     a unit with a primary and secondary air cleaner, the secondary (small
     paper element) clogged before even one day's test run could be
     completed. This particular unit had a Cummins V-12 engine that had
     paper/paper one one bank and K&N/paper on the other bank; two completely


     independent induction systems. The conditions were EXACTLY duplicated
     for each bank yet the K&N allowed so much dirt to pass through that the
     small filter became clogged before lunch. The same outcome occured with
     oiled foams on this unit.
     We discontinued the tests on the large pieces almost immediately but
     continued with service trucks, formen's vehicles, and my own company
     car. Analysis results continued showing markedly increased wear rates
     for all the vehicles, mine included. Test concluded, switched back to
     paper/glass and all vehicles showed reduction back to near original
     levels of both wear metals and dirt. I continued with the K&N on my
     company car out of stubborness and at 85,000 miles the Chevy 305 V-8
     wheezed its last breath. The top end was sanded badly; bottom end was
     just fine. End of test.

     I must stress that EVERYONE involved in this test was hoping that
     alternative filters would work as everyone was sick about pulling out a
     perfectly good $85 air cleaner and throwing 4 of them away each week per
     machine...

     So, I strongly suggest that depending upon an individual's long term
     plan for their vehicles they simply run an oil analysis at least once to
     see that the K&N or whatever alternative air filter is indeed working IN
     THAT APPLICATION... It depends on a person's priorities. If you want
     performance then indeed the K&N is the way to go but at what cost???

     And no, I do not work for a paper or glass air filter manufacturing
     company nor do I have any affiliation with anything directly or
     indirectly that could benefit George Morrison as a result..
