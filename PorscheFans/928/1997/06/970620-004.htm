Thanks for asking.  My brake are now able to lock up.  It took
a little while for everything to fall into place after I frebuilt
everything but the Master cylinder.  Now, the only possible proble,
left is a leak on the vacuum system for the power brakes.  It makes
them a little harder to use, but they still work great.

Now, for your problems:

To find the deffective pad sensor, you only need a visual inspection.
The sensor works by wearing out a plastic cap which is attached on
the inner brake pad.  The cap contain a small electrical wire which
clomplete an electrical circuit.
As the pad wears down, the plastic cap is eaten up to the point where 
the wire gets chewed up.  This create an open circuit and a warning
light on you cluster saying that the pads are thin.
So, now that you know how it works (if you already did, sorry for the
long intro), you have to check two things:
	1. None of the 4 plastic caps are chewed up
	2. All 4 of the sensor are connected to the car wiring.

For your problem with weels locking up, just a few piece of advice.
Start using your fresh pads easy.  They need a certain break in 
period (described as the pad getting to know the disk).  This takes
about 200 miles or so.

Got to go
