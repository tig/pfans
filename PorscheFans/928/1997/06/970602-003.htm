Larry,

It works like a charm! Push the button and hold it for as long as you'd like.
The tranny will shift to 2nd when the engine reaches about 5400 rpm. If you
back off of the gas pedal before ~5400, you're still in 1st _AS LONG AS YOU
KEEP THE BUTTON PUSHED!_ Yee haaa! If you're coasting down from speed (foot
off of the gas) and you push the button and hold it, the tranny will downshift
to first only when the cars speed falls below about 25 mph.

BTW - you can push the button anytime, any speed, and the tranny will only
downshift if that is safe and possible. It's all controled internally by a
combination of speed, current gear, rpm and vacuum.

UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS:

 I used a footswitch from a guitar effect. There are other appliances, such as
sewing machines or dictation recorders, that use momentary contact push button
footswitches. You _could_ just go to Radio Shak [sic] and get a tiny project
box and momentary pushbutton and mount your button in that box. Get some zip
cord.  Give yourself a few feet of zip cord to work with. Solder a connector
of the footswitch to one side of the zip cord and the other connector to the
other side of the zip cord.

Find the wires leading into the stock kickdown switch (located at the base
of the firewall under the gas pedal). Splice in one of the new footswitch
wires to one of the original wires and the other new footswitch wire to the
remaining wire. Insulate the wires with electrical tape to prevent shorting.

Hide the new wires under the carpet as you place the footswitch box at the
lower left corner of the "dead-pedal". Well, that's where I eventually put
mine. I use my left heel to press the button. 

Now, both switches work...but the new switch will hold a first gear start 
without the gas pedal mashed to the floor. Think about it. All that original
switch does is cause an electrical downshift in situations where the gas
pedal is on the floor AND a downshift is possible/feasible. Porsche would never
design (or accept a design) that could cause catastrophic failure. There's
no chance that the car will drop to 1st at 60 mph! That would violate the
algorithm (speed, rpm, current gear, vacuum).

I just made a mod that removes the pre-requisite that the pedal be on the 
floor.
