Not having seen that catalog, I took the original poster's word, which did
not make sense unless Devek intended to move the TDC sender (a difficult
and probably unrewarding thing to do). Porsche has built cars with
dynamically variable cam timing (the "Variocam" found in, e.g., some 968
cars), so there can be circumstances in which adjusting the cam timing will
provide benefit.

Even though I share your skepticism, I'll take Devek's word that a
judicious static offset in cam timing can pep up the engine, and include
that, along with changing the cams, in the list of discretionary mechanical
modifications which, if you find them attractive and understand the
compromises inherent in them, should be done before reprogramming the
ignition and fuel computers.

....where peak performance is everything, and mundane aspects of engine
behavior such as idle or smooth running at part throttle or relatively low
rpms don't much matter. With a car as multipurpose competent as the 928,
it's important to realize that improvements in peak performance may come at
the expense of comfort or driveability in non-peak circumstances. I
personally find it a shame to turn a 928 into another "twenty minute car".

Not to mention car manufacturers, whose idea of optimal performance may be
a bit different, but who know what they want (or obliged by regulations) to
achieve. Custom reprogramming for performance on the street falls between
these poles.
