Hi, P-fans. After driving a Porsche 944 for some 10 years, and over 173K+
miles, I'm now a proud owner of a creampuff (30K) white 1990 928 S4. My
experience driving it from San Diego to my home in Seattle, was better than
sex. It was posolutely, absotively, an awesome, exhilarating, driving
experience. Especially down the winding highway over the Syskyeuw (sp?)
mountains. 

On one freeway stretch from Northern CA into Oregon, I went from 85 to
around 137-140 in about 8 seconds, and remained at that speed for about 2
miles (I know, I know, too conservative for many of you young hot dogs). But
than became antsy about blowouts, and/or Smokeys hiding behind freeway
bushes. So I slowed down again to a reasonable 80. At 147 mph, it seemed
like I was in my 944 at 60 mph. I aimed it more than I steered it. Over the
1,700 some miles, I averaged about 20 mpg. What was truly impressive about
this car was it's dramatic acceleration features. I easily left a few people
tail-gating me at 75 mph, in the dust. 

During the trip back, the 928's digital readout computer told me everything
I wanted to know, (but does she love me? ) e.g.. mpg, distance to next fill
up, etc. (It even offered to drive while I snoozed. :-) Gad, what a car.
Love it. Thanks Randy S. (ex-owner, and frequent contributor to this forum),
for taking such meticulous care of it.

Creampuff 90' 928 S4

P.S. Regarding 928 low blue book value posts, I think a car like the 928 is
an exception. IMHO, I honestly believe that because of the inflexible rules
of supply and demand, that all existing 928s kept in perfect condition, will
slowly *increase* in market value as a Porsche lover's collector's item,
especially considering that after 1995, they're no longer being produced.
