At 6/5/97 you wrote:  Do you want me to this again in the future??

I do, particularly since so many people on this list are shopping cars.

I vote NO, since there are, it seems, always a lot of 928s & other goodies
on the web's Classified Porsche Digest, sponsored by Automotion, and updated
daily.  Anyone can go there anytime to see what's available.  Yes, let's
talk on this digest about what are the market trends, separate fact from
fiction (like whether such a thing as a never-cracked dash or a working
pre-85 power antenna or a functioning rear hatch release even exist in the
real world), etc., but I think we can skip the "hey, guys, did you see
the..." part.  Postings for cars NOT listed in the Classified Digest I think
should be encouraged.  The whole idea is to increase the knowledge &
experience base of a dedicated 928 community, yes?
