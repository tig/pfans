   Thanks for that answer Kurt.  At least I now know that my car can be
   balanced even if I choose not to fit adjustable front perches.  I was
   mainly concerned about this for the future when I install _some_ type
   of sport springs (which may not necessarily be the ones I've already
bought
   (see below)).

   Does this imply that there was a sport suspention option over and above
   what would have been standard starting with the '83 model year revamp?
   Perhaps the Bilstein shocks were the only items that made up this
   option (as opposed to also including stiffer springs, larger sway bars,
   etc.)?

   First, are the references to the Eibachs actually the springs marketed
   under the Weltmeister brand name?
   
   The "newest" Weltmeisters are progressive rate front (415(?)->5xx) and
   rear (300-350).  The "old" Weltmeisters are progressive fronts (270-415)
   and linear rears (270).  Are the springs sold under the Eibach name any
   different?
   
   Re-iterating a response that I sent to Matt earlier (Re: GT Springs 6/17):
   I spoke with Kim Crumb at the Porsche Parade on Sunday (very personable
   guy BTW) and he said the he had nothing to do with the development of
   the old Weltmeisters and that they are technology he was using
   eight years ago.  This is kit SP-9281 that is currently on sale at
   Automotion for $99.
   
   I bought the SP-9281 kit from Automotion and was lead to believe that 
   this was the SP-9200 kit (under a different stock number) that K.C.
   developed.  Buyer beware if you're looking for the latest...
   
   
   So many questions... So many people that know (or want to know) the
answers...
   
 Jim S. >>

I was going to put the springs on today from automotion($99), but I after
hearing that they are old technology I don't think that I am because I
already have the the sport spring /shocks package on my GT. If anybody would
like to buy the springs from automotion($99), I'll lower the price, but I
would like to sell them because I am not going to use them. Thanks a lot,
