Yes, sometimes. I repeat that I know nothing about rebuilding 928
transmissions. The 911 transmission only needs special tools to
replace certain specific parts. I only needed to replace synchros in
all three of the units I worked on (until I screwed up), and that did
not require special tools.

The mistake I made in torque caused first gear to try to climb off of
its mount. I had to replace several bearings and the ring gear/pinion
on the differential. Setting the lash in the differential requires
some pretty special tools. My local Porsche dealer let me do all the
repair, and they just did the shim adjustment. This is how I got away
with it 'only' costing $500. So this is one option to buying special
tools.

I thought rebuilding the transmission was kind of fun, the first time
anyway.
