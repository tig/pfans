	As I understand it, you can also freeze the compressor
	by running the a/c with only water as your coolant. Haven't
	seen this happen myself but you never know...

	You're lubricating the seals. They have a tendency to dry
	out and shrink thus causing a coolant leak. Apparently, once
	they've shrunk they can't be made to expand again. This is why
	it's a good idea to run your a/c occaisionally in the winter
	time so the seals don't stay unlbricated for months on end.
