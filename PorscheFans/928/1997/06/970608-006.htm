<<My 928 convertible has been called 'Miata like' more than one time. I think
the folks who say this are clearly non-automotive types. No point in arguing
with 'em, they wouldn' know the difference.>>

Gene-
I've had people tell me that my Lotus Elan looks just like a Mercury Capri
too.  Of course the only people that have ever said that drive away in econo
boxes that they paid more for than a nice 944 Turbo or 928 would cost.  I
just nod and tell them to go read a book.  Oh well, that just leaves more of
the Porsches out there for those who know how to appreciate a car for what it
is (not just a way to get from point A to B).
