Hello all,
I just have a couple questions.
I have an 87' S4 and don't have the foldable rear wing. Was this something
done only to a certain VIN # or what? Just curious.
Also, in the Devek catalog, (in the technical notes section) there is
paragraph about improving 4-valve engine performance by a timing adjustment.
(setting at  15 degrees ATDC instead of 20 degrees ATCD) I thought that the
timing was not adjustible on my car. The manual is not real clear on this and
I was wondering if maybe the pre-87' 4-valve models were adjustible and mine
isn't? Input, as always, is appreciated.
Regards,
Greg Schickel                    Had LT-1 Corvette for lunch today  ---
 Tasty!
