FIX THE PROBLEM OR RISK DISASTER!

Porsche is keen on providing multi-level warnings - no biggies you can
clear but level 2's or higher you can't.  In the case of your tension light
staying on I'd say it needs immediate attention!

I once lost a t-belt on a brand new motorcycle during break-in on the
freeway.  I could hear as well as feel all the valves striking the piston
tops, then absolute silence as I coasted to the shoulder in utter dismay. 
My only consolation, as this happened past midnight on Thanksgiving eve
(just try getting a tow, let alone for a motorcycle), was that the engine
rebuild was covered 100% by warranty.

Proceed with caution,
Phil
