Although I haven't worked on an S-4 electronic fuel injection I have had
extensive experience with a Ford Thunderbird Turbocoupe's fuel injection
system.  The controling mechanisms for adjusting mixture is a combination
of the mass sensor (usually a flap that intake air pushes open.  It senses
the density of the incoming air.), the electrical output of the oxygen
sensor, engine RPM, throttle body position and timing advancement.  If the
mass sensor, throttle body position or oxygen sensor are putting out an
erroneous signal the fuel injection will be affected.  Some fuel injection
systems that see signals that fall completely out of parameters will go to
a failure mode that is usually a much richer mixture than what is normal.
Anyway, the first thing I'd do to try to eliminate this problem is to clean
all connectors associated with the above sensors.  I'd be willing to bet
that one of your connectors has corrosion and loses contact or shorts when
it gets wet.

If it's missing then you may have an ignition problem.  That would also
explain the stench of unburned hydrocarbons.
