Re: Chunk's problems with his directional signals.  Don't know for sure if
this is the cause of his problem, but I had a similar problem on my 87S4 a
couple of years ago.  It turned out that the bearings in the steering shaft
had come unglued and jammed the mechanism that operates the directional
signals.  The new bearing was very inexpensive but the only way my mechanic
could get the old bearings out without dismantling the entire car was to put
a little magnet on the end of a long skinny rod, slide it down inside the
steering shaft housing and fish the bearings out one at a time.  Sounds
difficult but didn't take very long and obviated the necessity of
dismantling the entire steering mechanism.

One way to check is to loosen the locking lever for steering wheel height
and shake the wheel and control pod up and down.  If it feels wobbly or
loose in any way, the bearing is probably shot.
