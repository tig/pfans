I was the first in my office to own a Porsche, a  928 at that, then a
co-worker purchased a 1983 911SC converter to a 1995 body (cabriolet), he
wanted to race me, I got a real laugh outta that. He thought that his 911
was faster. I open the hood of my 928s (1986) and when he saw the 32V-V8
He backed out quickly, now he is shopping around for a newer  porsche (he
says the 928 has a big ass. I sad to him jokingly, " yeah how do you know,
are you alway sitting behind one when racing"  hehehe!)

      My boss went out and purchased the new Jaguar convertible 2 months
ago, one day I loaned him my 928s and when he came back he was immediatley
"Porsche Stricken" he went out and purchased a brand new 911 Twin Turbo
340hp 0-60 in 3.4sec.
It is said to be the fastest car in production. He's a competitive guy.

Which bring me to my question. What are the stats on the DEVEK 6.0 liter,
400+hp
0-60 in ? sec, and 1/4 times? Does anyone know? He is going around the
office  taunting me to race him. I keep holding off telling him that I need
new oil seals, but what I plan to do is drop the DEVEK monster on him (a
real sleeper). The 911TT does have impressive stats, It can even eat vipers
for lunch.
