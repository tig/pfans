Looks like I'm buying the red/black 87 S-4 I wrote about two weeks ago. 
It is a Southern car from Alabama with 120000 miles on the odo.  The PO 
has been out of town so no one else has been able to look at it, but it 
goes in the local paper this week for $11,900.  So, I figured I'd better 
move now, even though I've only driven one other 928S4.  

I've checked and even inquired on the list, but no local Porsche 
mechanics can be found.  (I need one in Augusta, GA.)  I'm going to have 
my "regular guy" mechanic, who specializes in Mercedes and services all 
imports, look at it unless someone tells me about a local Porsche 
mechanic before next Thursday.  My mechanic has no special Porsche 
tools.  Can you tell me what he should look for in addition to the 
following?

Belly pan
coolant/oil
compression test
general looseness or leaks
crash damage or underbody dents

Is there any possibility of damaging the car by performing a compression 
test or other routine test?

I spent about two hours with it today and uncovered only four problems:

*Sunroof not working.  (It worked two weeks ago.)

*Hairline cracks in windshield near lower left and lower right corners

*"Brake Pad" light on  (This was preceded by the ! light.  When I 
pressed it, the "Brake Pad" light remained on.  The brakes are not 
squealing, and when I mashed them at 40 MPH, they almost threw me out.  
The car has ABS.)

*Moisture around the fog light

*Cracked tailight lens

The roaring noise from the rear of the car I heard last time I drove it 
was gone.  (Road surface?)  The transmission shifts wonderfully, perhaps 
the best of any car I've ever driven.  There are no dents except a minor 
door ding.  The chin spoiler is not cracked or scratched.  There are 
very small cracks in the paint on the car's nose and it's a bit faded 
there.  The interior is perfect.  All the serial numbers on the car's 
parts match.  None of the wiring under the hood or dash appears to have 
been monkeyed with.  The owner's manual, spare tire and all the tools in 
the toolkit are present.  The owner has every record since 3/27/87, and 
the cambelts have been changed.  It was serviced regularly by German 
Auto Imports in Atlanta and they stamped the owner's manual each time.  
There's very little grime on top of the engine and no oil.  However, 
some of the paint is worn from the bar between the strutts and the cam 
covers.  One thing that worries me is that the owner only changed oil 
every 15000 miles from the initial 700 mile oil change to about 45000 
miles.  After that it was every 4000 or so.  If this had produced 
damage, do you think it would have shown up by now?

The original owner was an Alabama MD, and the second owner lived in 
Atlanta.  If that person is on this list, I'd like to hear from you.  If 
you think it might have been your car, please e-mail me and I'll send 
you the VIN number.

I've enjoyed reading your posts these last two weeks since I joined.  
Many thanks for the stories you have sent me about your Porsche 
experiences.
