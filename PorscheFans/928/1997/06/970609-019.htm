Haynes does not.  Chilton has one for the early models but is not
the most reliable source.  Another decent reference is the Mitchell
book for imported car for your model year.  On some of the procedure,
it looks like they copied the factory book.  They are expensive but
can be found at your local librairy.

The ultimate source are the factory book but the printed version has
been back ordered for a while.  Rumors are circulating about a 
CD-Rom version.  The microfiche are cheap and available but of so-so
quality when it comes to pictures.
