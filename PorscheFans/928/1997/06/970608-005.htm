So - I'm a stupid 20 year old kid with a 928. I'm supposed to flaunt all
that raw power, right? Ok - So I'm goin up the freeway, and this guy on
a motorcycle (like a katana or something) turns his head and gives me
the look, then immediately takes off.
I didn't give chase immediately because we were on a relatively crowded
section of highway, so I downshifted to fourth and caught up to him
slowly, then when a clear section of highway opened up, I looked over at
him and nodded, downshifted to 3rd and punched it. Now - for whatever
reason, when he saw that he decided not to race.. (I dont know why) So I
put it back into fourth and eased the clutch out - the car VAULTED
forward, my passenger hit the back of his seat like a falling brick, I
took my foot completely out of it (the gas) but the car kept going! I
was over a good 110mph before I realized there was a WALL of cars
approaching... the only thing I could do was take it out of gear... The
gas pedal was stuck to the floor!
It took me about 10 seconds to pry the pedal up, and in that time my
engine was running 6500 to 7000 rpms, and white smoke was BILLOWING out
of my exhaust..
I almost cried, but I got it off the freeway.. Anyway, heres the amazing
part, by the time I got off the road the smoke had stopped, and i
realized, throughout the whole thing the engine had sounded perfectly
healthy...
So Under the hood later when I got it home I had found that the oil
dipstick had ben pushed out about 3 inches, and oil had shot out of it,
and all over the block. The next 2 or so times I started it little wisps
of white smoke came out of the exhaust, but since then, no smoke and
everything seems fine..... :)
