I know this is a little late - I have been out of town - but it is in
regards to your 'charging system' warning light.
I drove the 928 to Vegas (from San Diego) this week - unfortunately when I
got to my hotel (Late at night) I left my amps on. (I mounted a remote
switch in an 'unobtrusive location' and since I had turned the stereo off I
didnt think to turn off my amps).. nonetheless, after a week parked in the
parking garage my battery was DEAD as a doornail.
A quick jump from the security service truck got me on the road - and I
noticed that for about 20 miles my warning light was on. When it finally
went off I decided that the battery had enough charge to disable the
warning. I proved this when, waiting for my girlfriend to run into a casino
at State-Line I left the car idling for about 10 minutes, and the light
came on briefly - I revved the engine a little and hit my 'reset' button in
my center console (which turned the warning off) - and had an uneventful
(but FUN) drive back to san diego. The car turns over under its own power
and everything is working fine etc.

So I guess what I would do is check your battery. (If you havent already
done that)
