Denet!

Dang it, it's deja vu all over again (I flubbed some of the original group
too).  I'll fix, well I better do it now as the cars in tonight (hopefully
after months of waiting).  Wait a minute I didn't even dev the film yet!

Jim scored a spare set of those springs - maybe you can get them from him? 
Was that your car with the small sub-box in the rear?  Reason I mention
this is because Jim also has/had a cool tri-sub box for the hatch area.  

If you can wait on this stuff I'm sure we'll all be at the "Hayward" meet -
Parts Heaven/Zone 7 PCA Swap Meet & Concourse!  I am definately going to
take my time through the booths as I cannot believe how many deals I missed
at Automotion!  Either that or put Jim on a tether (Suzanne can I borrow
it? heh heh ehh)

Ok, leave those tethers behind June 29th - Parts Heaven 23694 Bernhardt,
Hayward CA  1-800-767-7250

SEE YA THERE!
PT
