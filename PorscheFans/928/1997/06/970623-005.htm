The "Body Side Molding" was an option (Code 418). BTW Porsche is very 
"proud" of this option on 928s and 944s.  I recently bought my girlfriend 
an 87 944 Turbo that did not have it also. I thought can't be too expensive 
for 6 little 1" wide rubber strips, so I called my Porsche Parts Dude to 
check. Cost $604, yes SIX HUNDRED AND FOUR DOLLARS US. The price for the 
928 was even higher. But being the "parts hound" that I am, I went to my 
private "Porsche Stash" and got the 6 pieces in perfect condition from a 
wrecked 944 for only $50

Concerning the "Folding Wing" it seems that Porsche only did this in 87 and 
maybe 88. All the newer models I have seen do not fold. I have been curious 
as to exactly which years had the "folding wing". Maybe other "S4 owners" 
can send feedback on this. The same goes for the "Roof Antenna" I have only 
seen them on 89 and up.
