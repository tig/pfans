Hey, it's no big deal to me (or 928 list I suspect :)

I enjoy the occassional laugh (and sure was laughing last night at
microbrew night!).  

Speaking of which, that should remind everyone, negative commentor
included, that we are people not just emails, we're here because of our
common love for our cars, and heck, joking around with each other *should*
be as common as if we're standing right in front of each other at a get
together!  That goes for common courtesy too and 'extraneous', off-subject
emails seem to be kept down to a minimum fairly well...

These lists are made for the many and I'm sure that none of us will
tolerate personal attacks on our 'brethren' (not to mention our choice of
cars :)

FWIW, how much bandwidth does a short text msg. take up?  How long does it
take to delete a msg. you don't want, or, just click on the next button? 
Just like radio,  you're making the choice!  Turn it off or turn the
channel!  Pretty simple, right?  Don't even want to 'hear' from that
person?  Mute the email ID and never see another message!

Tell that poster to lighten up (or light 'em up!) and keep on Porsche'ing!

Phil Tong
