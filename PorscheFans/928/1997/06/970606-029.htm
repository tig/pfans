>      Ludwig Wittgenstein:
>         The possibility of "crossing" was encoded into the objects

>
>      Mark Twain:
>         The news of its crossing has been greatly exaggerated. 
>
>      Stephen Jay Gould:
>         It is possible that there is a sociobiological explanation
>         for it, but we have been deluged in recent years with          
>         sociobiological stories despite the fact that we have little
>         direct evidence about the genetics of behavior, and we do
>         not know how to obtain it for the specific  behaviors that
>         figure most prominently in sociobiological speculation.

>         chicken which has the daring and courage to boldly cross
>          the road, but also with fear, for whom among them has the
>         strength to contend with such a paragon of avian virtue?  In
>         such a manner is the princely chicken's dominion
>         maintained.
>
>     Hippocrates:
>         Because of an excess of pleghm in its pancreas. 
>
>     IBM Consultant:
>         Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was
>         threatening its dominant market position. The chicken was
>         faced with significant challenges to create and develop the
>         competencies required for the newly competitive market.
>         IBM Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client,
>         helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution
>         strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry
>         Integration Model (PIM) IBM helped the chicken use its
>         skills, methodologies, knowledge capital and experiences to
>         align the chicken's people, processes and technology in
>         support of its overall strategy within a Program
>         Management framework. IBM Consulting convened a
>         diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens
>          along with IBM consultants with deep skills
>          in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day
>          itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their personal
>          knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to
>         enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve
>          the implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting
>          and implementing an enterprise-wide value framework
>          across the continuum of poultry cross-median  processes. 
>          The meeting was held in a park like setting enabling and
>          creating an impactful environment which was strategically
>          based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear,
>          and unified market message and aligned with the 
>         chicken's mission, vision, and core values. This was
>         conducive towards the creation of a total holistic business
>          integration solution.  IBM Consulting helped the chicken
>          change to become more successful.
