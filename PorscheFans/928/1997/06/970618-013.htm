Hi All!

I get this information in Digest format and sometimes I am slow to respond
but here goes:

David Roberts commented on James Renfrew's question about the fuse panel in
our 928s and advised him to "just take some sand paper (fine) and polish
your "fuse" 
terminals (and gently tweak the terminals to hold the "fuses" tighter) to 
eliminate those "Gremlins" and call it a day? (be sure to blow sandpaper 
dust out when finished)".
There is another way involving spraying a special contact cleaner. I know of
two types, one called "Stabilant 22" and the other called "Wurth Contact
OL". The Stabilant 22 seems very popular but I can't locate it here in
Australia. The Wurth product seems to work reasonably well for me. Being a
"belts & braces" person, I tend to clean off the contact cleaner after a few
minutes with video head cleaner leaving everything nice and clean. However,
you do need to wiggle the fuses to "settle them in". Those newer "blade"
type fuses sure are better.

In the same Digest, Vincent H. Soo, refering to high power H4 headlight
bulbs said "I'm told the wiring will support the extra amps and I've been
running 80-100s' in
mine for about 3 years without any problems."
I just fitted 90/130's to my 928 and measured the voltage at the back of the
lamps. TEN VOLTS! The wiring may very well handle the extra current by not
catching fire but it sure as hell doesn't do its job properly. Ten volts on
a 130 watt high beam equates to just over 100 watts of non white light.
Probably not a whole lot better than a 55 watt bulb with 12 volts on it.
Needless to say, there are 4 headlight relays going on to my car very soon!
It sort of expected to have to install relays but took the lazy way out first.

Later, Mats. Lindvall asked about radiator failures and said "I was just
wondering if there is anyone out there that have had trouble with
transmission fluid in the cooling water??"
Yes, but not quite. I have a manual with the oil cooler in the radiator
header tank. This leaked slightly and was a pain as the oil pressure leaked
oil into the cooling system and the cooling system then overflowed pushing
the top floating oil out past the header tank filler cap. It had to be fixed
without undue delay. I noticed that a previous owner had replaced the
radiator and installed one from an automatic car as it had two oil coolers,
one for the engine oil and one for the transmission fluid. Rather than run
the engine oil lines to the other side of the car, I noticed that the
radiator is symmetrical and so I just turned it upside down. (Actually, the
thermo fan switch had to be cut off and the body left in situ as a plug.
This was not a problem as I was replacing the engine driven fan with an
electric one anyway and it uses an expansion bulb and capilliary tube style
thermo switch that fits into the radiator hose). Turning the radiator upside
down turned out to be a big waste of time as the never used oil cooler
leaked more than the other! I got stranded a long way from home with the
contects of the sump, mixed with the contects of the radiator, squirting out
of the header tank. I stopped the car before any damage was done but the
clean up job was a real hard one! I eventually got the radiator recored
using my original header tanks. This was neccessary as the extra pressure


had exacerbated a slight leak. Whilst the radiator was apart, the two oil
coolers were removed and the holes fitted with blanking plugs. I then fitted
a 19 row "Earl" brand oil cooler behind the radiator (next to the electric
fan) and, with some adapters and brazing, fitted the original oil lines to
it. Problem solved. I was advised that this fix is not satisfactory as the
radiator water is used to heat the engine oil whilst the engine is warming
up. However, this was not true as the 928 engine has an oil thermostat to
prevent the flow of oil to the cooler until the engine has warmed up. For
your information, the two oil coolers in the radiator are identical. Some
people said that the transmission cooler is smaller - it isn't. A local, and
very competent, radiator rebuilder who specialises in Porsches
remanufactures these radiators with stainless steel oil coolers but I
elected to go with an external air cooled unit. It had to be physically
larger, of course, as the thermal transfer coefficient of water is better
than air (4 times, I am told?).

Still later, Jason Keel asked about the viability and value of sourcing a
928 in Japan and importing it into Australia.
Jason, the Australian Government will hold out its hand for import duty and
sales tax. This will cost you about 60% of what you paid for the car. Then
there are other sundry shipping and customs agent fees followed by stamp
duty when you register it. I have done this exercise and, believe me, the
car has got to be pretty good to make it a viable exercise. From the
description of your car, I don't think it is a good idea.
