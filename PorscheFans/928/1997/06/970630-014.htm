I don't think so, but there are different designs for US vs. ROW cars.

The US design is fixed.  So you must have a ROW headlight bucket.  Is
your car Euro also? In the ROW cars, the ball socket is attached to an
air-pressure operated piston or plunger. You can see a plastic tube
coming out the rear of the headlight bucket assembly.  The plunger
spring has probebly been lost on yours.  The one Euro headlight set I've
seen the ball/plunger is spring-loaded - if you push on it, it will
return.  The Euro cars (at least 77-79) have a headlight height adjuster
on the floor just to the left of the drivers' seat. Maybe all you need
is a US-style ball socket/plunger.... Or, you could try pulling the
plunger all the way out and applying a little "Crazy glue" to keep it
out.
