Hello All

I was having a few problems with my odometer not working and I sent the
whole gauge cluster to North Hollywood Speedometer to have it looked at.
The turn around time was very good and I thought that all my problems had
been solved. After I installed the gauges and turned the ignition on I got
a new problem. When  the key is in the on position the speedo jumps to
110mph. All the other gauges seem to be working fine. I called and told
them the problem and like having someone come out to fix an appliance, they
hadn't seen that problem before. I took the instrument pod apart again last
night to get everything ready to ship out again. I decided to go through my
installation procedure again to make sure that I didn't hook something up
wrong. I got the same result. With the dash all apart I thought I'd check
the gauges all by themselves, not bolted to anything. So I hung them upside
down under the steering column with just the electrical connections plugged
in. I thought it might have a ground somewhere that would be causing the
strange behavior. I did support it with my hand so it wasn't pulling on the
plugs. I turned the key to on and everything stayed where it was supposed
to. The speedo needle didn't move, I was thrilled that there might be an
easy explanation for the problem. I moved the guage cluster to where it was
supposed to be but still not bolted into place. The problem returned. This
was driving me nuts. I tried hanging it again and it worked again. I put it
back in its normal position and decided to try tipping it toward me to see
if this did anything. It went back to normal, the needle going to zero, at
about 45 degrees. When I tipped it back it went to 110. The only thing I
have come up with is a loose connection in the speedo housing. I thought I
heard something move around when I tipped the housing.

I'm sure that this isn't the way North Hollywood Speedometer lets things go
out the door. Something probable came loose during shipping. I'll send it
back and see if they get the same problem. If they don't I'm not sure what
I'm going to do.
