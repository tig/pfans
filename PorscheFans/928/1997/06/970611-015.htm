How does one rate the belt tensioner?  When I changed my belt, I 
rebuilt my tensioner by changing the ruber boot, changing the
gasket behind the tensioner, changing the tensioning bolt (it
has some sealer on part of the threads) and a very quick run of a ball
hone inside the cylinder followed by a few stroke of 1000 grit
sand paper.  Oh and taking all the little disk off and cleaning them
(read wiping them clean).

Put the thing back together, filled it with TRANSMISSION OIL, and
that was it.

Was this OK?  Does anyone has a test to detect a bad tensioner?

Just very curious,
