i have a US spec '79. when i got the car 9 years ago,
the cat had been gutted (among other things).

my exhaust system looks like this: each bank has a manifold
which ends near the rear of the engine. the cat is a 'Y' shaped
affair, with two inlets, one for each bank, and one outlet, which
feeds to the primary muffler. from there a pipe runs back to the
secondary muffler in the left rear of the car. when mounted,
the cat is just aft of the bellhousing.

adjusting the fuel injection is quite easy, once you've got
a 3mm hex-ball driver, at least 8 inches long. i made one out
of a normal l-shaped ball driver and some round stock. cut the
short leg off of the ball driver. drill a hole in the end of the
stock about 3mm in dia. push the cut end of the wrench into
the stock and epoxy in place. bend a handle on the other end of
the stock and presto. to adjust, put the wrench through the hole
in the air cleaner housing till it seats in the adjuster, then PUSH
DOWN until the adjuster meshes into whatever it is that it moves,
then turn 1/8 to 1/4 turn whichever way you need.
