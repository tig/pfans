 I had recalled reading something about rebuilt racks on the Founder's 
 (a.k.a. Potomac) Region PCA web site
 (http://pcapotomac.org/porschetalk/portfrm.htm), so I went back and
 found these pieces of a thread on "86 928 steering problem".

The steering wheel on my 928 binds as if some thing is preventing it from 
turning. I had the steering rack replaced but still have
the same problem, This is random and happens at very low speeds and at high 
turning circumstances. Any advice?

Binding of rebuilt racks is quite common as pattern parts will have been used. 
This problem very unlikely to happen with genuine
factory replacement. Suggest you go back to mechanic who fitted your rack and 
get him to supply another but be prepared for
same fault if the rack is not the genuine article! I know the above from 
experience with two other 928S4's.
