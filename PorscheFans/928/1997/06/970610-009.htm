ATTENTION GT FANS,

Went to a remote junkyard today, Guess what I found behind the bushes? A 
black 91 928GT. It was really hard to tell what it was for a minute till I 
caught a glimpse of a 928GT wheel sticking up out of the WAD. Body is 
totally mangled, but engine is complete and seems to be unscathed, (car has 
only 18,000 miles, belonged to drunken ATLANTA FALCONS player who almost 
died doing the custom body work to it last year). Someone has already 
snagged transaxle (darnit). I got perfect leather center console, clock, GT 
shifter assembly, Leather parking brake cover, etc. The rest is pretty 
trashed (they had to cut roof and door of to get him out and you could not 
put a penny in the area where a passenger would go) Oddly the seats, and 
rear bumper cover/lights are perfect (already spoken for unfortunately ) 
The guy knows what he has and wants $6700 for engine complete. Send me a 
list of wants and I will check on condition and price for you.


Thanks,

David Roberts
