  On which model year did adjustable FRONT spring perches become standard?
  My '83 only has them in the rear, and the Parts & Tech Ref Manual doesn't
  even list front adjustable perches for the '77-'88 cars.  Automotion sells
  a $200 kit to allow front adjustment; is there a way to retrofit a factory 
  setup to an older car?
  
  Without the capability to adjust in the front, is accurate corner balancing
  even possible, or will this just lead to a case of "this is as close
  as it can get"?
