928 Fans,

Had to respond to this, I have and do own both 16-Valve 4.7 liter and 
32-Valve 5.0 liter. I put 80,000 miles on an 84 928S (total mileage when 
sold 192,000 never rebuilt, still thumping with new owner)   with no 
problems at all, I have also put 50,000 on 32-valve engines 86 928S (total 
mileage when sold 143,000 never rebuilt, still thumping with new owner). I 
currently own both 80 928 16-valve, and 89 928S4 with 32-valve.
   The timing belt scare (in my opinion) is there to make you realize how 
important it is  to replace your timing belt on all vehicles (you here the 
same story with Hondas, Toyotas, Nissans, etc.) Most of the "HORROR 
Stories" are from owners who ride they're Porsches to death and do not do 
the common sense maintenance (rare occasions of defective belts, etc. 
excluded).
As far as the choice of 16-valve engines or 32-valve engines it is pretty 
simple, ONCE YOU GO 32-VALVE YOU NEVER GO BACK.
 I would put a new Timing belt on my 32-Valve every week and replace the 
heads every month, (if I had to)in order to have the Major Difference in 
Power and Torque.

JUST MY 32-VALVES WORTH, ( go ahead and flame away)
