Could we make your meeting on a video-conference call??  Then we would
have 928 meeting all over the country.

More practically, we might want to try to find a CHAT room and
all log on at the same time.  We could discuss freely while having
our favorite drink in our respective home!!  This could be fun,
especially when the drinking might interfere with the typos...  And
it would be socially acceptable as no drinking and driving!!

Just a wild, friday morning blues, idea.
