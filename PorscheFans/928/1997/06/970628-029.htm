Andy ONLY (all others please skip this and forgive me for the wide
           distribution):

No, Andy. I think _you_ need to re-read the thread. 

I _backed_  my argument that I thought it would be obsurd to make concessions 
for subscribers without a web browser by _extending_ it to the obsurd point
of making concessions for subscribers without e-mail.

Don't worry...I'm a computer scientist...actually, that's _one_ of my degrees.

You're forgiven, I'm grumpy,
