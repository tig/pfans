The fuel filter is located at the very rear of the tank, under a
small steel panel.  You can see it between the tank and the bumper.
Remove the panel (1 or 2 bolts) and you will expose the fuel filter
and the fuel pump.  When changing the filter, have a few rag and a
bucket
ready as ~ 2 cup of gas will spill over.  Make sure you disconnect that
battery
first, that you are in a well ventilated area and that you are not
1. smoking
2. welding
3. playing with a lighter
4 or anyother source of ignition (like showing a kid how caveman uses
stones to make sparks ;-)

I am positive that the spillage would not be directed inside the tank.
It would make it too easy for foreign material to enter the tank. 
Remember
that your car was built before the great environmental paranoia.  This
is
also why they force "profesional" gas pumper to be used in NJ.

As far as water goes, I would try to add some fuel conditioner to your
tank.
this should eliminate the water present in it.  Do you always buy your
fuel
at the same place?  Is it a reputable chain?  Is there a lot of gas sold
there?

Just remember that gas goes bad.  If you buy gas in a place that has low 
volume sales, especially common with the use of premium, the gas might
go bad
or they might have water in their tanks...

Well, I am done preaching,
