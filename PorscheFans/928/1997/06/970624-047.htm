Jay,
I have a suggestion on a  neat, hidden, place to put amps in your 81 928 
that will not damage or "butcher" your 928 in any way.
In an 84 that I used to have, I bought a rear A/C console (without the A/C 
unit) and replaced my rear console with it. The A/C console has an area 
inside of approximately 17" long , 7" wide and 6" deep. This gave me room 
for a subwoofer and an amp. The wiring is very simple also. There is 
already a place to run your power feeds straight to the battery (less than 
a foot) , the same route for wires if factory A/C was installed. Also your 
signal feeds can run under the main console, then under center console, 
fish wires under carpet 8" to A/C console and your done. The existing air 
vents on the top of the A/C console allow for sufficient cooling and to 
vent subwoofer if installed
ALL THIS WITHOUT ANY IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE TO YOUR 928, NOT EVEN A SINGLE 
SCREW HOLE.
