Stephane,

Sorry to hear that you are still working on your brakes!  It sounds like you PO
really butchered them...  I am sure that you'll get many years of use out of
them now.

When I bought my car, it seemed that the pads were dragging - although not
nearly as bad as you had it.  I lucked out, because after the brake fluid
changes they are working fine.   Hopefully, that's all you'll have to do with
your brakes in the future now that you've done the job right.

I hope you'll be enjoying your car soon!

Jack
