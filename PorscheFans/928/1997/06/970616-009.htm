I'm new with the communications here but have had fun reading. I've got a
problem with myn928S, 86 and until I get my manuals like a lot of you I'm
looking for some help.  About a month ago, I noticed the engine would reev.
up when I lifted my foot off of the gas for a stop. Auto trans. would shif
then the idle would go down. Now, as soon as the car get to running temp. the
idle will drop to 300 +- and the engin will begin to idle to 1800 then back
to 300. It willo do this for about 10 cycles then idle drops off to 0 and
engine dies. Will start right up but back to the reving cycle. Any ideas out
there. Its a sensor (s) but I can't isolate withou the manual and a Porsche
mech. won't share their knowledge. Help.
