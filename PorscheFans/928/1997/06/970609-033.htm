BILL KELLY WROTE:
My 928 convertible has been called 'Miata like' more than one time. I think
the folks who say this are clearly non-automotive types. No point in arguing
with 'em, they wouldn' know the difference.  There's a Miata in the
household, and it is a wonderful car. Virtually perfect in its realization
of the 'British sports car that works' concept.
But give me the rumble of the V* any day.

Bill:
Yes, the Miata is delightful and a remarkable success in achieving its
goals.  Do not, however, confuse the Miata's dynamic qualities and
capabilities with the car its styling most closely mimics: the original
Lotus Elan.  No car designed to operate on the street -- Porsche or
otherwise -- combines the sheer agility, telekinetic steering and controlled
compliance posessed by this otherwise enormously flawed car.  The Miata,
good as it is, is a very pale imitation.
