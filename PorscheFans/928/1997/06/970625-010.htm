PSS. Having a 32 valver, I heard a "certain" sound and asked the


mechanic to check. He said he didn't hear anything and asked the others
in the shop to listen. After a half hour of this "listening" we agreed
that the tensioner on the left bank was failing. Replaced it (102K miles
on motor). So much for chains lasting forever! <G>
