Sure!

It was not really that difficult. ;)

1) Remove lower cushion on seats
2) Fold lower seats forward as far as possible
3) Look on the back, by the headrest. On the right hand side, there is a
plate where the top of the seat assembly is attached. This piece "cams"
and allows the seat to fold forward. There are two hex bolts on top of each
other.
It is a tight fit, so an angled hex head driver works best.
3) Unscrew both bolts.
4) The seat must be lifted up and to the right to remove the
"bar" that is attached to the left side of seat (it goes into
the center storage compartment)
5) To reassemble, simply do this backwards.

If anyone has any questions about this, please let me know. I realize
I do not have the technical jargon down for the various parts, but
I can describe it in more detail if anyone wants.

Now that the rear seats are replaced, and the interior
once again looks good, I can get down to some serious
performance work. ;)

Thanks!
