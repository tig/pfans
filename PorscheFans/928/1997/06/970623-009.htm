All,
I remembered another movie where I was impressed by the 928.  It was
a movie about a guy going through his mid-life crisis.  The movie was
shot in Texas, and involves a guy going out and buying a new 928,
having an affair with a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, etc. etc. The part
I remember most was a shot of the headlights coming up just after he
picked up this nice looking cheerleader.

The movie was called Middle Age Crazy, and starred Bruce Dern and 
Ann-Margret. It was released in 1980.  I called oce of the local
Blockbuster stores, but they didn't have it :(
