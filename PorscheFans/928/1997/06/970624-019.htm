Sorry Mark, sent the reply to you instead of CP Koch.

(for entertainment purposes only)


C. P. Koch,

Chris, Chris, Chris, Tisk,Tisk, Tisk,   If I wanted a beemer, I would have
purchased a beemer.
duh! The cash I will spend on a BMW850 can be invested into my 1986 928s.
I can take that medicore 282 V8 and convert it into a 6.0 liter 400+hp
monster.
Chris, why in the SAM H*ll would I want to go buy another car (joking,
hehehe), especially
when this one is no longer owned by the bank. Dollar for dollar I get more
hp and
bang for my buck. Who gives a con-sarn H*ll about resale value, I'll show
you some
resale value! Resale value was the whole reason I bought the 928, it was
best deal I
have ever made, and I don't plan to sell a $50,000 car when I purchased it
for $10,000, now tell
 me
about resale value again. I don't plan to sell a bargain like that. In the
spring I
plan to buy a second 928, heck $100,000 worth of car for about $20,000.
(joking again, hehehe!).

In these hear United States of America, image is everthing, When I take
my car around town and to the car wash, all that most people see is the
Porsche
emblem on the back and they are in awe, "Wow, you must have paid a fortune
for
that car", then they are in disbelief that it is over 10 years old. I look
like
I am riding in extreme luxury without squandering the bucks. Secondly, it
is a V-8 sleeper,
most cars pullup next to me at a light and assume I am packing a 3 or 4
liter,
4 cylinder or 6 cylinder to their dismay they get to read the emblem on the
 rear
of my 928. Some times
I give them the jump and wizzzz by, peak over to the side and watching as
they stomp
on the gas pedal
in frustration trying to put their accelerator through the floorboard
(hehehe).

The then turn to their passenger and say "kemo-sabe, WHO WAS THAT BLACK
CAR". They reply
"I don't know it was moving so fast all I could read were the numbers on
the back "928" (lol)

 (hehehe)


Note! a successful dope dealer is, one who hasn't got caught yet! or had
his
BMW 850 impounded and sold a gov't auction (hehehe!).And besides I have
never been called
 YUPPIE Trash, while cruising my 928!

Dear Mark,

The BMW 850CSi is a wonderful car for its purpose - high speed luxury
touring.  You can drive non-stop cross country and get out feeling like
you've had a good night's sleep at the Marriott.  The car is loaded with
electronics and hydraulic systems for everything one could imagine.  The
aluminum 322hp. V12 weighs within pounds of the medicore 282hp V8 but
pulls like a runaway locomotive throughout its rev band.

Unfortunately, it is heavier and much more expensive to maintain than the
928.  Also, they tend to hold their resale value far too high for most
us...

If you wish more information, e-mail me directly (cpcs@juno.com) - I
don't wish to offend anyone on this list.

Yours,
C.P. Koch

PS.  What is a "successful dope dealer"?
