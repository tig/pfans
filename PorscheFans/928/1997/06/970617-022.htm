Probably the movie to most feature the 928 was Risky Business with Tom
Cruise. I think that movie was probably the first time I had seen a
928. It was actually a pretty stupid movie, if you think about it, but
it served to introduce me to the 928. I think I walked out of the movie
with a resolve to one day own a 928.  :^D  And now, 15 years later, I
am in the market.

I love the scene where he's backing the 928 out of the garage, and
Dirty Laundry by Don Henley is playing. It's at the very beginning of
the song, and all you hear is that real low, slow beat. Then Cruise's
character kills the engine with too much clutch. The music stops.  He
starts the car again, and the music picks up again. Pretty funny, but
you have to see it to really appreciate it. It's a visual/auditory
thing. Oh, and *am* remembering right, aren't I? The scene I just
described was in Risky Business? It's been a long time. :^D

Another movie that I remember with a 928 was one of the Cannonball Run
movies, or some movie like that. Unfortunately, it's not a nice scene -
a 928 is crushed by a monster 4x4.  :^(
