Oh, well. The time has come to say farewell to my favourite group. I'm
leaving my present place of employment in Brisbane Australia and returning
to the sands of Riyadh Saudi Arabia for another contract. 

I must stress it is a happy thing because I'll be working with the fellow
who has my baby and with some luck, tantrum throwing and begging I'll be
getting my beast back and return to the owners ranks once again.  

Armed with the knowledge I've gained through membership of this group I look
forward to commencing my own project-928 with confidence and enthusiasm. 

The only restriction on my life in Saudi will be a distinct difficulty in
organising 'net access but  hopefully it won't be long before I'll be back
on the mailer. 

I'd hate to be half-way through removing the dash, say Oh-Oh, scream for
help and have nobody hear.

Best of luck and Good wishes to all...

Terry Webster

P.S. Stephane, if Santa does come good with the list I've asked for, I'll
Email you a copy OK. ;-)
