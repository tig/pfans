David,

Please don't butcher such a fine automobile with aftermarket speakers. They 
don't fit right, they damage the leather or vinyl, and it WILL DEVALUE your 
928. Especially for a "purist" who would pay top dollar for your car 
someday, if it was all original.

I had to replace my complete leather door panels (at a cost of over $1000 
used) just because PO put different speakers in the doors and the grilles 
were only 1" larger in diameter (no big deal he thought). The original 
speakers could not be used again because of the "imprint" in the leather 
and the original grilles did not cover the "new aftermarket speakers" 
mounting screw holes.(even though the speakers fit the actual "hole")

Plus, Porsche and Blaupunkt spent years of "R & D" to come up with a 
compromise between sound quality and weight (this is a performance car not 
a pickup).

There are many places you can get the original speakers used. (I know the 
new factory replacement costs are outrageous on these speakers, from $175 
to over $300ea. depending on which one). Let us (928 Fans) help you find 
them.

Please think twice, I might pay you top dollar for your car someday. IF you 
don't butcher it.


FOOD for THOUGHT,

David Roberts, President
