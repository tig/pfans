Congrats on the new car! Excessive chatter is a frequently-mentioned
problem noted even by the automotive press/reviewers of the time.  The
dual-disk clutches were famous for it.  Allegedly, that is an important
reason Porsche changed to the single disk clutch in later years.

Having said that, I have a dual-disk clutch that doesn't chatter, and
I'm sure others do also.  I'm told that you can expect 125-150,000 miles
before a clutch job is needed with this type of clutch.  Chattering can
be caused by some oil or other foreign matter getting onto one or more
of the engagement surfaces - and a dual-disk has a LOT of surfaces to
get dirty, fail to line up etc..  If the source of chatter is a leak of
some kind, a clutch job may not solve the problem.
