Hi John,

I have never dragged raced before, so what the hell.  I'll try anything
once.  I am pretty active on the autocross scene.  I have nine more
autocrosses this season, and I'll be at Lime Rock August 21 with CART. 
It like an "open" track and its a blast!  If youre interested, drop me
an email.

I can't make PCAs June 29th autocross, but what are some of the other
autocrosses that you will be at.  If it fits the schedule, I'll be
there.
In the CT Valley Region PCA has two or three 928s at the autocrosses,
but they run all over CT, sometimes two hours from my place.  CART runs
in Bristol CT, which is an hour and a quarter.

You can see my car in action at Phil's site.
