The principle of the Hirsh tube is as follows.

In a cylinder, introduce compressed air as to create  a vortex.  Now,
extract air from the center of the vortex and from the edge of the
vortex.  One will be hot, the other will be cold.

If you asked me this question a few years back, I could have told you
the thermodynamic expalantion.  At this point, after many years of
engineering, the conclusion is that it works, and that the amount of
cold air is equal the amount of hot air (nothing created, nothing
lost...)

Well, a few more details are coming back, the cooling is due to the 
gas expanding in the chamber (same principle as your AC)

Just trying to increase the general level of confusion to my own.
