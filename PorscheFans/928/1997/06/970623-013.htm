<<<<Anyhow, I am using the 3M hand polish.  How much red should I see on

my rag??  How much can I scrub trying to remove some of the previous

swirl?  Is there something with a little more "punch" but still safe?>>>>

Stephane,
You really should be using a paint cleaner before you begin to polish or wax
your car.  The red on your rag is only oxidized paint which should all be
removed before you wax.  If the PO didn't take very good care of the car then
you may get quite a bit of red on your polishing rag, but don't worry about
it.  I am not familiar with 3M car cleaning polish, but I can recommend Zymol
to you.  I never use buffers or any mechanical polishers on my cars and Zymol
is the absolute best product that I have ever used (and I have no affiliation
with Zymol except being a satisfied customer).  It is very expensive, but it
is also an excellent product.  You should first clean your paint with either
a clay ball (made for this purpose) or a paint cleaner.  Remove any visible
tar, dirt, oil, etc. from the paint- you will in the process be removing
unseen dirt in surface of your car.  Paint is not smooth as it appears to the
naked eye, it is much like your skin- pitted, cracked, and very uneven. and
dirt hides in these areas.  After the paint is clean (you will be able to
feel how smooth it is) it will be time to polish.  This restores natural oils
and nutrients that are lost (in the same way leather dries out) from exposure
to the sun.  After you have polished then move on to the wax.  This process
will take you the better part of the weekend, but it will be well worth it.
 Take your time, be meticulous, and don't be afraid to do any area more than
once.  It took me a couple of weeks one summer to get my black 928S4 in the
condition it is in, but if any of you ever saw it you won't believe it's an
87.
Good luck!!
