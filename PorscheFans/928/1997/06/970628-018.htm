Thanks to help from people on this list, I was able to locate the wheel
polishing info (928 Archives - Feb 10).  I'm going to remove all the finish
from my '85 flat disk wheels since no amount of cleaning and polishing to
date has improved their appearance much.  I already have the polishing
materials and will try to occasionally post updates to the list on how the
job is going.

I've been lurking on this list since last year and have enjoyed and
benefitted from the posts.  I have an '85 928s 5-speed that I bought in '93
with 82k miles.  It was not in great shape but it checked out mechanically
ok and I got it cheap.  Since then, I've had the clutch and timing belt
replaced and I've repaired the climate control (no, I don't know how it's
supposed to work), oxygen sensor, idle control valve and various other
small problems.

A quick note about the O2 sensor...it almost caused a fire in the fuse
panel of my car when the +12v wire leading to the sensor chafed against the
exhaust heat sheild and shorted.  I had to roll down the windows and pull
off the road immediately and shut everything down as smoke was pouring out
from the passenger footwell.  According to the schematic in the shop
manual, that circuit is not fused.  Some of the wires burned almost
completely in two in less than a minute before I was able to stop the car.
Needless to say, when I replaced the wiring, I put a fuse in series with
it.  If the protective tubing leading from the sensor is intact (mine
wasn't), you shouldn't have this problem, but it wouldn't hurt to look
under there and make sure everything looks ok.

Seems like they could have fused the O2 sensor ckt and put a warning lamp
on the dash to indicate a failure.
