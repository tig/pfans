==== I'm on my soap box ====

Oooh. Hit my Porsche Pet Peeve. Porsche doesn't approve of *anything* electronic in your car other than their OEM products. Specific examples: radar detectors, cell phones, CB, and amateur radio. If you think a new Porsche doesn't run right with one of those installed you are up the creek without a paddle.

> This is common sense and is done by all manufacturers for "Liability

Actually its as silly as not warranting the car to run in the rain. You know the car is going to be operated in the rain. You put windsheild wipers on it. But a simple statement in the warranty book or elsewhere that the car isn't warranted to keep you dry in the rain is a very poor practice.

I'm associating RF fields with rain here, if you haven't figured it out.

You know a car is going to experience strong RF fields. The cop that just passed you because he couldn't believe a Porsche was doing only the speed limit is on is 100W radio telling others that you are coming. You know rich TV personalities are going to have to have a Porsche one day and will be unhappy if it doesn't start in the station's parking lot due to RF fields. And you know all Porsche owners have to have cell phones. (Well, I don't, but you get the idea, I've got a 45W amateur radio transmitter instead.)

And while its easily to pass off the make we all love as simply protecting themselves legally, I refuse to believe it. Chrysler, Ford, and GM, have gone to great lengths to test and certify their current products for use with RF devices. Each has free information on exactly what they've tested the vehicle for, on frequencies, and power ratings. Where to pick up the electrical power. Where to put the antenna. How to route the cables. Can you imagine a Detroit automaker trying to sell cars to a police department and telling them the warranty will be void if they put a police radio in it? At least 2 of the big 3 Detroit automakers bought floor space (enough space to display a minivan, each) this year at the Dayton Hamvention and was handing this info out to all takers.

Look at it another way. Porsche is proud of improving their breed with racing. And touts engineering excelence. In mechanical, I agree. Electrically.... groan, have said enough already.

I keep the above in mind every time I'm tempted to look at a new Porsche. Meaning, I haven't checked to see if its still current PCNA policy.
