I didn't mean to have my T&D experience come across as horror stories
but I wanted people to go there with their eyes open, as you should
when you go to any new shop.  My experiences with T&D are from last
year so maybe things have changed.

I got along with Tom (and Jay) but became disappointed with the
follow-through.  I've sinced learned (through a friend of mine
previously involved with racing 935s and F5000) that Tom had some
distractions outside of the business last year.  Maybe I just went at
the wrong time, so go ahead and give him a try, if you like.  Other
customers there at the time were really pleased.

I myself am going with Devek, where my car is sitting as I type.  I
dropped in about 5:30pm last week for the first time.  I talked with a
mechanic (shame on me, I don't remember his name) and Mark and Susan.
 They were all still smiling and very personable, even at the end of
the day.  They each spent time talking with me, whether about my 928, a
928 in the shop, two-stroke motorcycles, training their dog, etc.  No
rush and quite helpful.

So this last Saturday saw my Euro getting on a flatbed for the ride up
(I'm in Sunnyvale).  The people at the towing operation had nothing but
good things to say about "the people in front" (the towing place is in
the building behind Devek).  Hope Susan & company didn't go into shock
upon seeing my car; it is far from pristine.  I bought it two years ago
for $5500.  Lots of fun but no threat to any concours show.  But that
does free me to make mods that I wouldn't do on a "better" one.  (And
since I've got a M.E. degree and a desire to race, who knows what will
happen.)

Geez, that's more words than I've ever posted.  Once I get the car
back, I'm looking forward to getting in on one (or more) of the
get-togethers.

OK, back to lurking now.
