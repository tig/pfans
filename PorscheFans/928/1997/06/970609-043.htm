There are alot of heat shields underneath the 928.  For example, the
heat shield on mine that protects the steering knuckle was half-rusted
and it rattle once in awhile.  The reason why you don't hear the rattle
when you put the car in gear is because it is running at a lower rpm. 
The torque tube?  I doubt it but possible.  If its the tranny, run away
from the car.  Its at least a few thousands for trans work.  Let us know
what your mechanic has found!
