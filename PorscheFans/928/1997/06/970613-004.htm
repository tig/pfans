I have a list of seven people (you know who you are) who each want a set
of shop manuals for their beloved cars. The best advertised prices are
around $250. I'm hoping to get at least 10-15 people together for a
"bulk purchase" when the manuals become available. I believe we should
be able to get a reasonable discount as a group and, in fact, was asked
by one company's representative (who happens to monitor the group) to
contact him when I had a number so that he could offer a price.

If you are wanting in on this and haven't sent me an email requesting to
be put on "the list", please do so. I'll be sending the people I do have
on the list a status note confirming our numbers before the weekend is
out. I you thought you were on the list, but don't get my email, let me
know.

I'll repost this in a week or so for those that may miss it...
