Hi All!

Just thought that I would throw in my 2c worth on this topic.
I have had Alfa Romeos for many years and they have a timing chain to run
around their twin overhead cam sprockets. They are very reliable and have a
tensioner to take up any stretch. As one other person on this list
commented, the timing chains are usually replaced at an engine rebuild.
My Suzuki Vitara 4WD has a 2 litre quad cam V6. It has three! timing chains.
There is a little one between each pair of camshafts and a main one doing
the round from crankshaft to camshafts. I have a warm and fuzzy feeling that
these little buggers are going to go round and round for the life of the engine.
My 928 has a cheaper and quieter rubber belt but the consequences of it
breaking are hardly worth thinking about. For a few extra dollars on a very
expensive car, coupled with a bit more engine noise that I wouldn't hear
anyway due to the voluminous sound deadening in the 928, give me internal
timing chains any day! Peace of mind.
Now, if you want timing gear noise, go for gears! I was near a Datsun
factory rally car years ago and it sounded like the motor was shot!
