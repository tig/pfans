Jim,

I have seen adjusters on all year models of 928S's 81 and up. I think it 
was part of the "Sport Suspension" option. My ex-84 928S had all 4. The 
most cost effective way to add them to your car is to go to a "yard" and 
get them off a "salvaged" 928. I bought some 4 years ago for someone else 
and paid $75 for  Front/Rear set (plus they were original Porsche parts, 
not aftermarket stuff). They "slip" right on most all 928 shocks (except 
BILSTEINS) with a few exceptions. I would suggest replacing your shocks 
with new BOGE GAS shocks, or if you want to spend more, then obviously 
Konis. Be sure to tell you supplier you have " Ride Height Adjusters" on 
your car.
There are a couple of places I know for sure has the "used adjusters", 
P.A.P. in Atlanta (770) 449-3146 ask for Wayne and me, of course.

There is an "Adjustment Tool" available that allows you to adjust ride 
height and corner balancing with out even jacking up the car. You just 
reach under rear tire and behind front tire  (you must turn front tire to 
one side) it hooks in adjuster notches and you turn to raise or lower. (it 
has a long handle to unstick those corroded adjusters, with elbow grease of 
course) If you install used ones you can clean and lube them first and they 
will move easily. I bought one 6 years ago and it is great.
The "tool" is make in the US and is available at "Industrial Tool Supply" 
stores (Not Home Depot)
PROTO brand, Model # C474 , 2" to 4 3/4" notch adjusting tool . Cost about 
$75( if memory serves me correctly)

Thanks,

David Roberts
