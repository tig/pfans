Well, I bounce this back to the list as I only have enough knowledge
to be dangerous, not helpful ;-)

People can correct me (and I know you will) but the 85 was the year
when the Borg-Wagner "design" was introduce.  For what I understand,
it is more than just a tweek, it is a significant improvment.

The 928 automatic has alway been rated as a very good sport car.  Until
the single disk clutch was introduce, some of the articles in magazine
were saying that the auto was a better buy.  The 0-60 are only slightly
better with the 5 speed and, truetfully, they probably are the same
on a care with some years on the odometer.  However, in MY mind, a
true sport car has to be stick.  The only thing I would like would be
a tiptronic, where my wife can drive the car on auto mode and I can
still
have full control when I am driving.

I think that you can change to the single plate clutch but it has not
been covered on the list.  The cost of the multicomponent is higher but
I am not sure if you need to change it all when replacing the clutch.

Again, someone on the list that has done some work on the clutch should
be 
able to fill in the blank.
