Subject: K&N on fire?

After digesting all your info on K&N versus Amisoil air filters - and
talking to a family friend who is a distributor for K&N, I decided to
look more closely at K&N as a viable option for my car. (especially
since I can get a reuseable K&N for HALF the cost of a throw-away
regular filter) When speaking with my mechanic - he said that he has
actually seen K&Ns catch on fire in 928s!

I use K&Ns on my 1986 928s and I think they are great. Hopefully
your mechanic did let the solution dry before
placing it back into the filter housing (as per K&N directions).
 Heck, anything coming out of an aerosol can is flammable should you put a
spark on it. About a month ago there was a segment on a TV show (Dateline,
60 minutes etc...)
on WD-40 which stated that these cans will explode when coming in contact
with
 a spark or electricity. As a kid aeresol can were my favorite blow-torch,
just place a match in front
of the spray and viola! Most aeresol can content is flammable.
