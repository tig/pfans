Whupers - 

No, no... I made that comment but meant they only shared certain
similiarities.  Obviously the Miata would be outclassed in performance vs.
a 928 unless you're racing down a REALLY twisty road - but that's where
it's most at home by design.

wasn't entirely accurate...

Well, it was fun to read!?!
