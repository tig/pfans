Hello all,
I realize that this post has no Porsche content so I'll keep it short, but I
am selling my Lotus and figured that someone on this list might be interested
(or know of someone who is).  My car is a 1991 Lotus Elan.  They are
convertibles and only 500 were brought into the country in 1991.  The car is
red/charcoal with a black top and has 36K miles.  The car has never been
wrecked or had any paint work, and has been enjoyed but not mistreated.  I
have a list of upgrades and more info on the car to E-mail those who are
interested.  I also have scanned pics to send.  E-mail me or call for more
info.  The price is at around $24,500.
Thanks,
Brian E. Buxton
