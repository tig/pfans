Just a quick caveat.  T&D worked on my car throughtout '96 but it got
very frustrating.  Several times I showed up for my car and it was "not
quite ready"; extra time varied from an hour to two weeks!

I had the timing belt replaced (along with many other things) soon
after I got the car.  They never mentioned the 1000 mile readjustment.
 At 1400 miles, I ended up towing it 200+ miles; the belt had jumped
four teeth.  Lucky I've got a two-valver.

After tearing up two Yokohama 008's in 2000 miles with a chronic front
alignment problem they couldn't figure out (it was the alignment shop
they farmed stuff out to), T&D put two USED Fulda(?) tires on my car
and wanted to call it even.

I don't recommend them.  Stick with Devek.
