Congratulations! I suggest that you point your browser to Phil Tong's Web
site (http://www.928s4vr.com/), go the to the "Option Codes" page, and
decode your VIN and M-codes so you'll know exactly what you've got.

This is not correct behavior. Your car automatically adjusts the clutch, so
these symptoms probably mean that it's time to check out the clutch for
contamination or excess wear.

Because driving styles and circumstances vary so much, I don't think
there's a firm rule about miles for clutch replacements. When the clutch is
worn out or screwed up, replace it. However, make sure that the hydraulic
system which actuates the clutch is healthy; ditto the automatic adjustment
mechanism.

>Otherwise the car is great!

You betcha! Drive it hard, take it everywhere you can, and you'll discover
lots more to like about it.
