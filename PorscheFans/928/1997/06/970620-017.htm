Kurt, 

  Yes -  MAJOR P.I.T.A.!  For those that haven't dealt with this piece
  yet, be aware that if the ball cup separates from the ball pivot, you
  won't be able to change gears.
   
  There is only about 1.5" of space between the torque tube and the 
  floorpan, so there is really no way to get your hands in there to 
  do the work.  I used a combination of an open end wrench, a crows 
  foot wrench on a long extension (preferably 1/4" drive, although I
  think I was able to use 3/8"), a piece of rope, and an 18" screwdriver
  to get the job done.  It wasn't a pretty site, and the factory probably
  would have had me excommunicated, but it did work.  BTW, I did this 
  without the aid of a lift although I'm not sure that a lift would have 
  helped much.
  
  Here's what I did:  first, I dropped the exhaust after the cat.
  Next, separate the shift lever from the front guide rod (another
  feat in itself).  If it's not off already, push the ball cup off
  of the ball pivot.  Next, I (you're going to cringe...) looped the
  piece of rope around the guide rod near the ball cup to pull it
  to a position in which I could get access to the stop nut.  The
  danger with what I did is that there is a chance of damaging the
  bearing (which is welded on top of the torque tube) in which the
  guide rod sits between the shifter and the ball pivot.  From there,
  it is just a matter of patiently removing the old ball cup and 
  installing the new one.
  
  There is _no way_ you could follow the rather precise measurements
  that the workshop manuals call for when adjusting the clearance between
  the ball cup and the ball pivot.  I just worked with it until things
  felt right.
  
  I did all of this about two years ago and have only put about 2K miles
  on the car since then, but so far, everything seems to be working fine.
  I'll probably drop the exhaust again sometime just to make sure
  the stop nut is still tight, since applying any real torque to it is
  difficult.  I put some Loctite on there just to be safe.
  
  In retrospect, I think I would study the workshop manuals to see how
  difficult it really is to remove the torque tube.  I just have the
  concern that there may be some rotational preload on the tube that
  could make reinstallation a pain.

  BTW, the dealer want $90 for the ball cup.  928 Int'l got it for me
  for $45.
  
  Good luck.  You're going to need it.
