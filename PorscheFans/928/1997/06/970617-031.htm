It took about an hour before my mouth stopped gaping open.  Wow...what speed, what sound, what a difference!  The best part is:  Vroom-Vroom car loved it.  I have always driven with conservative RPMs believing that is what she wanted.  Turns out, she wants more.  Now I want more.

you can tell by the serial #.  If you have any of the automotion or
other magazine, look at the brake pad section and they will tell
you what the number is.

If you are familiar with brakes, The "newer" 86 had the upgraded 4
pistons calipers (fairly large assembly which might be stamped
with Porsche on it(?)).  The older brakes are a floating calliper
type (large piston only on the inside)

Hope this help, if not, give me another call and I will find the
exact serial number...
