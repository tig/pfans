Well, thanks for the encouragement! I really appreciate it. What I
really want is the '86 with the S4 brakes and ABS. That way, I'll have
the body style that I want (I prefer the older-style taillights) but
the 288HP 32V engine. A good compromise between age and features, and
it's looking like I'll be able to afford it more and more all the time.
I have a line on one in OH - the fellow said he might take $10,500.
Actually, since it's so far away, I might have to see if he'll take
$10,000, since I would have to budget some $$$ for a flight up there to
pick up the car.

I agree with that. Let me tell you this - I am glad I learned how to work
on cars when I was a kid!

Thanks.
