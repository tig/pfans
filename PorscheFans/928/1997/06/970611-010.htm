What problems?  Just maintain it and there are no problems.  (I'll ignore the
944 comparison)

What price, what condition, etc?  Those are important considerations.  What
do you want out of the car, can you afford to buy a later model, etc?  Do you
have any specific concerns about the car you are looking at?  We need a
little more detail in your questions.  You are looking for the shotgun
approach whereby everyone emails you exhaustive lists of pre-purchase
suggestions.

And by the way, if you have your heart set on an '84, I have a good deal
avaialable if you are interested in hearing more.  I'll be out of town until
Sunday, and if you email me directly I will be happy to give as much advice
as I can, and let you know more about the '84.
