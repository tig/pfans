Thanks.

Vince,
Always Remember to check Factory Parts, the current replacement trim for 
the side windows are made of black plastic (don't cringe, you can' tell the 
difference ), they never fade, they don't get bent out of shape, and they 
are cheap, about $8 to $13 per piece new. It is what came on the late model 
928(if its good enough for a GTS it's good enough for me). As far as the 
front and rear trims I am not sure as to cost (they are anodized by the 
way) , but check with your local Porsche Dealer for prices on new ones, you 
might be surprised to find there are some parts that are not ridiculous.
P.S. - Get to know your local Porsche dealer parts guys and discounts of up 
to 20% are not uncommon.
