Tim,
I bought an 84 928S Auto about 8 years ago, and the first week it did the 
same thing to me.
Found out that I had a front seal leak and when the fluid got to low the 
car would only work in 1st (also "slip" totally at 3500rpm) and reverse. 
(thank goodness for that) . A local Porsche mechanic said he could fix it 
for $2700 , I said bull!%*@, and put more fluid in it and drove it home. 
(he said I would not make it around the block). I drove the car for 4 years 
and 70,000 miles this way (still going the same with new owner and another 
40,000 miles) , the only thing I had to do was put a quart of fluid in it 
every month to 2 months. It ran and shifted perfectly with no problems. 
When I noticed it would start to slip a little I knew it was time for more 
fluid. This not the "professional way" but it worked for me for a long 
time.
