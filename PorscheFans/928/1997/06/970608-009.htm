     I am sorry to say I had an engine fire while checking my compression. 
     4 fire extinguishers and two hoses and 5 minute it was out.
     
     Damage was not as bad as it could have been.
     
     
     My harness from Bosh ignition electronics is toasted.  Also wiring 
     around. Main power routing around starter/alternator. Reset of engine 
     compartment is OK including rest of engine harness.
     
     I had my drivers side door open and the gunk I had just use caught 
     under the car.
     
     The drivers side door was open and it was toasted.
     
     Could you please send me use harnesses for ignition, and use drivers 
     door panel. 
     
                                        Depressed,
                                        Ron Gross
