James,
This is a great idea, and being an electronics technician for the last 22 
years I should have included it in my procedure. But you should do it after 
complete cleaning (yes, with sandpaper or equivalent) of the terminals to 
retard any new corrosion on the terminals. Those cleaners do not totally 
remove the corrosion on the contacts and  just "wiggling in"  will only 
last till the lubricant in the "Contact spray cleaner" wears off  or if 
 Mach speed vibrations and potholes moves the fuse slightly and the 
"Gremlins " are back.
Also consider that most of the contact problems I have encountered is from 
P.O.s that did not know how to properly install and remove those type of 
fuses, which spreads the terminals and causes corrosion in between the 
fuses and contacts to start with. In most cases they still need to be 
"tweaked" to original tension.

James,
Put your Fluke Model 80 across the back of the 55 watt lamps and you will 
still get 10 VOLTS. Which makes a 55 watt lamp like a 30 watt lamp. 
Off-Road guys have know this for years. We always direct wire our lights to 
the battery and switch them with relays from  the original light feed. 
Jacobs Electronics has had a Kit for this out for a few years for almost 
every car made. It comes complete with professional wiring harness,  relays 
and easy instructions. Makes an amazing difference 55 watts looks like 150 
watts and 130s or 150s looks like a "Freight Train". This kit or your 
suggested relay idea is one in the same and will give you between 13.7 and 
15 volts to lamps depending on alternator output. (rough on lamp life).

John,

Starting in 1990 with the "GT" and in all "GTS"  Porsche did use an 
external oil cooler, and plugged the old oil/water cooler, it is located 
underneath the radiator housed in a special bracket, and cooled from 
additional air slot in the front spoiler. So using a "Earls's" external oil 
cooler should be no problem. Only problem with the location Porsche used is 
that every once in a while you can hear the dull "thud, thud" of little 
bunny rabbits bouncing off of it!

Thanks for the great tips.
