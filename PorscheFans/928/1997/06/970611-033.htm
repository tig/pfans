The year of the car will also affect the cost of the 5 speed.

In 85, the 5 speed was upgraded with the better syncro design.
In 87, the clutch was changed to a single "plate" design.

All of these factors will influence the cost.  If you "just" want
to drive around town (even in spirited way) the auto is OK.  If you
plan to track the car, the 5 speed is worth the extra $$ for the
added control.

Now, if you could fit a tip-tronic to the car...
