That sounds like something that happened to me. I had recently bought
my motorcycle (see below) and was tinkering around on it. I noticed
that there was an empty socket in the fuse block. Hmm. So, I put in a
fuse 1/2 the recommended rating, just to be safe. Nothing happened.
Then I realized that the left front turn signal was on (not blinking,
though), and the key wasn't even in the ignition! I had a look, and it
turned out that that TS was wired incorrectly. I guess they had
replaced the TS after it had been broken off in a spill (this poor bike
has been horizontal more than once, I'm afraid) and had gotten the
wiring wrong.

How it occurred to them to remove that fuse, is beyond me. It has
nothing to do with the turn signals; it's the fuse for the
taillight-out warning annunciator. I mean, I can just imagine:

"Hey, this new turn signal isn't working right. It stays on all the time."

"No sweat - just start pulling fuses until it goes out."
