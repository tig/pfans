I would like to let you guys know how great the Porsche Parade was for the
928 owner, but....IT SUCKED!!!  YOU SHOULD ALL BE ASHAMED!!!!!  Ok...not
Elliott Nowacky, Jerry Gebhard, Vaughn Garrett, Eddie (don't know his last
name), Kim Crumb, and about 7 others.  That was all of the 928's out of the
about 400+ Porsches at the Parade in San Antonio this week.  It was sad from
a number stand point that no more showed up.  We have more 928's than that
show up locally here in Austin at our gatherings!!

Sorry I yelled at you guys...I know we all have jobs (other than taking care
of our babies I mean) and some of you are VERY far away...like a few oceans
away.  Those of you who live in TX, particularly central TX have no excuse.

For the good news...I won my class in the concourse, as did Vaughn...of
course the competition was terrible...just us in our respective classes!!
 Still...PCA national concourse class winner sure sounds good to me!!  There
were 3 early 928's in the preservation and restoration class one from CA has
been to like the last 8 Parades and was absolutely perfect!!  Sorry you all
missed it, it sure would have been nice to fill the grounds with 928's
instead of a bunch of those air cooled beasts.  No offense to you 911 owners.

Hope to see you all next year!
