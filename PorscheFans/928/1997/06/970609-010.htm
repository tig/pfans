There is a Chilton manual which covers the 79-8? 924 and 928. It isn't
worth the paper it's printed on. Mitchells shop manuals cover the 928
reasonably well - the wiring schematics are particularly well done. The
problem is that they cover many cars (typically most imports) in one
monster shop manual and you are paying for it all.

Here's an idea Porsche Fans:

Many of us are wanting full shop manuals, but have found that all the
regular sources are sold out of their stock and are waiting for
shipments from Germany. Why don't we put together a list of people who
want them and guarantee x number of sales to the single supplier who
gives us the best delivered price. If interested send me an email. I'll
tally them up, and if we can get above, say, six sets, I'm sure we can
get a discount.
