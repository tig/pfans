What a great event last Sunday's charity swap meet was...  

I got there around noon (missing Jim Murphy who had already scored a full
manual set for way cheap it makes me want to cry) but I did score a couple
of stickers and Up-fixin volume from the PCA table!  

Here's some more attendees:

'85 928 S blue - Madison Gunter (pulled up as we were leaving so we stayed
for another hour or so!)

'82 928 blue/black? mit der SuperVing - Alan Ng - this guy was scooping up
parts left and right and they almost didn't fit in the hatch!  Secondary
muffler for $30!  Like new, absolutely clear fog lamps for $25 each! etc.
etc.   We all watched and whooped as Alan took off down the street past all
those 911's... I REALLY dig that big NR wing with the stock S spoiler!!! 
Technology rims too.  Will post pix asap...

'86 1/2 928 S  - with homemade hitch for bike rack, etc.  I forgot your
name but your highway stories are really interesting.  Not a listmember,
YET...  This car was practically a dead ringer for my '84, save for my
leather interior...

Philip Eskilden - since neither he nor I had our cars so I felt a little
better!  What a nice guy to talk with too...

'85 928 S a black diamond in the rough - Dennet & girlfriend Lei .  Hope to
see and hear from him alot on the list!  Did you get those Weltmeister
springs?  

White S4 auto - took off before we could circle the car!

'86 928 S - blue w/ tan int. - Gentleman with his daughter whom we met
years ago at another Automotion swap meet, I think it was 1993?  Car still
looks great!

'82 928 mit der Competition Package - Bronzish with gold anodized S rims...
 My wife was already bugging me to leave so didn't get to say bye but at
least had a quick chance to say HI!  I thought this car might have been one
of those elusive 928 Weissach editions which I've yet to see in the
'wild'...

'90 GT - Gordon Sparkes!  And a vendor even - for the life of me I don't
know how I didn't see your GT among the other 'booths'.  It must have been
doing it's stealthy shark thing!!!  Hope you make to Hayward in a few
weeks!

___?  Edmund's Black? widebody 928!  Not present that day but he promised
he'll be at Parts Heaven!  We both discussed the red 928 with tall Strosek
wing and skirts seen around the 19th Ave. area of the city.  

This was the biggest turnout of 928's I've ever seen at Automotion and I'm
sure there were many more before and after we got there!  One thing is for
sure, we're a friendly bunch and with no hesistation to come up, shake
hands and chat!  

MARK YOUR 928 CALENDARS - SUNDAY, JUNE 29TH PARTS HEAVEN, HAYWARD, CALIF. !
 8th Annual Porsche Swap Meet & Zone 7 Concours (Philip E. here's your
chance again!).  For info call 1-800-767-7250

There should be an even bigger turnout now that we're getting connected AND
Paul Carver from FlowMaster (trick '79 928)  is hoping as many 928's from
NorCal will appear - we'll do the swap meet/etc. and then maybe do a
'parade  /pizza run' in the late afternoon???

SEE YOU THERE (Vince!) !  

THANKS AGAIN AUTOMOTION FOR A GREAT EVENT!
Phil
