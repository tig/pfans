This as been debated at lenght and I guess its a matter of taste or
linguistic origin.  In english, I think it make more sense to use
Porsha.  But wen I speak French, I use Porsch because it sound better 
and it does not mean a wooden veranda as it does in english.

But hey, if santa claus give you what you want, do you really care if
I call my 928 VW?? ;-))
