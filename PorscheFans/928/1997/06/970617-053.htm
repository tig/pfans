I think that your Porsche, like mine and my Acura, does not have the
usual
grease fitting that you might be accustom to.  There is no use, to my
knolwedge,
for a grease gun on our car.  Most of the element that need greasing are
sealed,
at least from the element.  To grease the front bearings, you need to
take them
apart...

If I am wrong, please lt me know.

Go to http://www.my-porsche.com
 There, you will find the owners manual and the warranty book for your
car.  They
will tell you all the service required for your car.  When ordering
these books,
you should consider the Porsche Technical Specification Book for your
car and
its model year.  It will provide you with the torque setting of all the
bolts on
your car, its performance rating, the explanation of the serial number,
all the
dimension and capacity and so on.  This is well worth the $9 it cost.

For question about your radio, I would point you to
http://www.blaupunkt.com/
I used this URL before but I am unable to find the host tonight.  You
might 
want to try it a few time.  If it does not work, look at the web yellow
page and find Blau's 800 number.  They should be able to help you out.
