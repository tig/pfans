Thanks for the stuff. Hope you got your money order ok. The set was as
perfect as you advertised. (First time I've bought parts for this car and
not felt like I was cheated, thank you) One of the wires had about a
centimeter square of insulation missing in what looked like a scratch
(probably when the wires were removed) - I re-insulated it and the whole
set worked fine from san diego to vegas and back.
Unfortunately the wires themselves didnt completely solve my missing
problem at 2500 RPMs - I am (when I get paid again) going to have my
mechanics run a compression check and try to figure out why its happening.
(Cruising it is NOT a problem, but when I am 'taking off' it almost feels
like i have "turbo lag" :)
The only hard evidence I have that anything is wrong was that the #7
cylinder plug was fouled (fuel fouled) - But my mechanic said it was
because the PO had put in 'Splitfires' - but since the car has new plugs
(Bosch Platinum) cap, rotor and Wires (which although didnt solve the
problem needed to be replaced anyway) I am thinking there is some
mischevious underlying problem at work. My air filter is in desperate need
of replacement but I am flat broke at the time. Could that be contributing?
