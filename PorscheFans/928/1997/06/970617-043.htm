The same thing happened to my 81 928. I purchased it used with 71k =
miles. I drove it 80 miles and the radiator blew. The automatic =
transmission fluid mixed with the antifreeze, creating a "strawberry =
milkshake" type fluid. Luckily the pressure from the transmission was =
greater than the pressure to the transmission.=20

I ended up replacing the transmission, and flushing all the fluids. I =
had to have it flushed every 100 miles or so until everything was clean. =
Total cost of $1500

Hi everyone,

I've got a couple of (I'm sure) simple questions for you.  Where are the
lubrication points on my 79 928?  Every vehicle I've ever owned has a
provision for greasing the front end and various other points on the
chassis, but given a cursory glance I can't seem to locate them on this
car.  Where can I acquire the scheduled maintenance handbook for my car
and how much should I expect to pay for it?  And finally (for now) how
do I preset favorite radio stations on my blaupunkt stereo?  The top set
of buttons are marked: LW AM1 AM2 SW FM FM and the bottom set of buttons
are the cassette controls.  Right now every time I turn on the stereo it
is tuned to the station on the far left of the dial and I have to search
through to find what I want.
Thanks for all of your help!
