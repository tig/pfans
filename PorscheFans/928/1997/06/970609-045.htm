Hi,
        I just finished looking at a 84 928S Black/Black/Auto.  The car
appeared to be in good condition, compared to
several 928's I've looked at.  This is what I found, including a possible
show stopper (need help diag'ing this one).

Pros
1. Appears to have original paint, manuals, original sticker, etc.
2. ~54k miles.
3. Dash has no cracks.
4. Front S spoiler not cracked.
5. Working rear hatch release, power ant., etc.
6. Drives fine, shifts smoothly, downshifts fine.
7. AC works.
8. Original toolkit with no missing pieces, inflatable tire, etc.
9. All the power components seem to work except for the power sunroof (see
below).
10. Leather in good shape.

Cons
1. Several scratches, good number of paint chips, etc.
2. When engine is running and car is in park, there is a rattling sound from
under the car.  This
goes away when the car is placed in drive or reverse.  I had a regular mechanic
look at the car and he didn't see anything like a rattling heat shield
causing the vibration.  
He thought it might be the tranny or a related comp.  I remember someone on
the list saying it may 
be the torque tube?  I am having the car looked at on Thursday by a PCA
recommended Porsche mechanic.  
My question is - if it is the torque tube or tranny related comp. what type
of costs might I
be looking at to get it fixed?
3. Sunroof doesn't open/close.
4. Rattle in drivers side door when driving.

Thanks!
-Mike
