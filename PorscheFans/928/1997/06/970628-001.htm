re: car nut -  Jim - I've never seen anyone tear around corners like
that except another biker!  You da' man.  Our interests are very
similiar but I think you enjoy ripping turns more and I enjoy top-ending
at the max more?  A good team either way and my offer stands for you to
nav with me at the Sept. PE100.   Also re: Bonneville and possibly
cracking Al Holbert's record - DEVEK brought up a good point:  the
SALT!  So maybe someday we'll get a 'specific-purpose-928' to save our
street cars?  Talk to ya more on Sunday.

What do you think
Phil,
 1st annual 928 Concours/Drag Race/SwapMeet/SoundOff/RoadRace/Autocross?

Enough 928 fans throw in and we could rent Sears or Buttonwillow for
sure!  I know the Ferrari folks have been kind enough to co-sponsor such
a day - bringing out the 6-liter cars as well as that supercharged 928
too.  I'm game for sure!Definately don't miss Parts Heaven!  Get there
before lunch - Paul from Flowmaster said something about organizing a
no-host lunch & 928 cruise/parade around town...  ( I had to say parade
since we know what cruising speed is in a 928!)

Get there before Alan does with his 'super-vinged' 928 because that is
one serious bargain hunter!  The weather should be fantastic - shine 'em
up and rumble on over!

Phil
