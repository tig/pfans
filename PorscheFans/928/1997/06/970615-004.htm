Tim,
I would not "Trust" a $34,500 engine (new replacement cost) to a "mechanic" 
without the proper tools, would you?

Seriously, there are a lot of Good "Non-Dealer" Porsche mechanics (many who 
I feel care more about your car than the "Clock Punching" Dealer Mechanics, 
who very rarely see a 928). But if he says he is a "Porsche Mechanic" and 
does not have a P-201 tool RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

P.S. I have "Hand Tensioned" 928 Belts many times over the years with never 
a problem before I got smart and bought my own Timing Belt Tool. But I do 
not do it for a living and would never take that chance on someone else's 
928 or 944.

Just my opinion (I could be wrong )
