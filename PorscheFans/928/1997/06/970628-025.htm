Franz is wrong. A new belt must be retensioned after about 1000 miles (some
say as long as 3000 miles, but the point is to catch the early-lifetime
stretch before it gets out of hand).

I'm safely on the opposite coast, but I thought I just saw a post full of
horror stories about T&D. If it's just a question of 1000 miles v. 1100
miles, how about waiting until Monday and going to someone you like?
