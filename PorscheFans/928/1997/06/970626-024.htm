  Did you mean $140,000 U.S. Dollars ?  I was under the impression that
the most expensive 850 model was the limited edition 1994-5 850CSi,
which had a sticker just under $100K.  Base price on a 1996 840Ci was
$74,400 with the 850Ci going for $93,300.  The '91 models, which
originally had a base price of $73,600, are the ones that can now be had
for about $30,000 with average miles.

  Or were you talking about a Dinan version ?  :-)
