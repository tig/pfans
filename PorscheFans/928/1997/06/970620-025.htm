Yes. I just replaced this myself. It was very easy. I simply disconnected the
front shifting rod off of the shifter by removing the leather boot, plastic
cover and the upper clip. I then slid the rod off of the shifter. Then I pried
the plastic cup off by using a couple of motorcycle tire irons under each side
of the rod right at the cup. 

At this point I should tell everyone that this was _very_ easy for me to work 
on because the engine and clutch are out of the car! 

But even if the engine had been in the car, I'm sure that one could pop the
plastic cup off from underneath. I *would* recommend applying approx. equal
pressure from both sides, as close to the cup as possible.

Once the cup is off, with the rod free, I was able to easily move it towards 
the side of the torque tube. In this position, I was able to get a crescent
wrench spanning the cup's topside and bottomside, and use another wrench to
unlock the locknut. As you remove the cup, try to count the number of turns
that it takes to disconnect it.

When re-installing, you should first re-connect the shifter. Then, figure out 
a way to keep the shifter in neutral and vertical. A friend is an excellent
solution here. I put grease in the new cup and threaded it into the shifting 
rod the same number of turns that it took to disconnect it. Locking down the
locknut can be tricky because you want the cup to be level when the shifter is
in a vertical position. Tell your friend to hold it tightly or make sure that
your make-shift (no pun intended!) shifter clamping can handle some torque.

If this is just too hard to do from underneath the car, simply remove the
motor and clutch! ;-)
