Now you've done it. *joke* :(
There you go telling me that so now I *have* I have to research the
possibility of finding a used set of signal/fog/DRIVING lights to fit my
car.  (I've always been a fan of Cebie, Hella, Bosch and Marshall driving
lights as well as GE aircraft landing lights!)  Anyone have any leads on
this?  Do I have to make any modifications to my car to fit them?  Will the
existing wiring harness fit?  Is my assumption that only S and not S4
lights will fit?  Meaning I need to find Euro 928s' from '78-86 light sets?

Leave it to you 928 guys to make me spend more money. (sigh)
