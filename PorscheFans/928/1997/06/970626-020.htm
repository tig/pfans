STOP YOUR MECHANIC, NOW!

CALL HIM, NOW!!!

The symptom you describe _may_ just be low tranny fluid. Yes...it happened
to me.

Problem here is that your mechanic may see this as an opportunity to make
quite a bit of money off of you.

Go down to the shop NOW!

Check the fluid level. There's a reservoir on the right side of the tranny.
Check after the engine and tranny are warm.

Sure hope your mechanic is honest.
