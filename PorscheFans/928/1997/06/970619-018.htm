Subject: Dennis Wilson /belt tension indication

I can't recall a single 928 (and I've had six of them) that didn't flash
the "Belt Tension" warning from time to time.  After having the tension
checked a number of times on a few cars I finally just ignored it.  I have
also had false indications of brake pad wear, tail lights out, and several
others that I can't recall.  That electronic nightmare up above the
passengers feet should have been redesigned a long time ago.  Its' one of
the 928s worst weak spots in an otherwise superb automobile.

You would have to be nuts to ignore the timing belt tension light, that is
unless you
wish to completely rebuild of your engine (hehehe). If it is an 1986 go
right ahead, ignore it,
it will just make my 1986 928s more endangered and rare (hehehe) The cost
of having
it checked out and adjusted is very little compared to the cost of
replacing your engine.
I bought a 1986 928s two years ago. The lot that I purchased it from told
me that the light was on because
the fan belt needed replacing ( I have a thing about red lights, Thank
Porsche).
I took it to my mechanic "Manfred", and he replaced the belt, about 1
months later
I was racing some teenager in a Mustang on the Hollywood freeway and I
punched it and the light came on
again, I panicked and drove immediately to the shop (the owners manual
recommends smooth acceleration).
I took it to Manfred for an adjustment and viola!,hasn't came on since.
He told me that the belt needs to be broken-in and readjusted after so many
 mile, more so when you
replace it. A brake warning light is very different from a timing light.
Have it checked out.
Its kind of scarey to know that a rubber belt can be the difference between
 joy and castastrophe.

1986 928s (with the 1985 brakes) #0176
* boy I was dissapointed to know that my car wasn't 1 of 1000 with the 1985
brakes on it.
Maybe I should buy a late 1986 Model #3011-5000.
I am looking for a 2nd 928 in the spring of 1998 I got $12000 to work with
want to take my current 1986 and drop a 6.0  DEVEK 400+hp.The second one I
want to convert to a Cabriolet, Imagine a hardtop and covertible 928
sitting in the driveway.  (The envy of all envies).
