Lee,

I think I would buy that car.  It is a little high on miles but a great deal.
 My '88 is in comparable condition w/ 65k miles and it cost me $20k.  It is
also very nice w/ all records etc.

With these cars the biggest problem is in the things that bolt onto it that
are non Porsche, like water pumps, A/C compressors, Alternators, etc.  The
motors are pretty bullet proof if you change the T-belt every 40k miles or so
and go ahead and do the water pump at the same time while you are at it.

I would watch for leaks around all of the gaskets in the upper end of the
motor (me and two or three other S4 owning friends have just dumped between
$1800 and $2000 on this job), also the A/C fittings and gaskets are likely to
be going out soon (that is usually another $1k or so).  And the last thing to
watch for is the steering rack starting to leak and thus needing replacement.

These are all probs that I have seen w/ '88 S4's and they have all shown up
at about the same time in the life of the car and it is just to coincidental
to not be something that happens to them all about this time.  As an aside
each of these cars had roughly 70k miles on them so it may be that the PO has
already taken care of these problems.

Good luck and enjoy,
James Morrison
