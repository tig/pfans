Thanks for help so far on coolant leak. (See original posting below.)

Reponding to various suggestions and questions:
Checked plastic coolant overflow tank and area around it with strong
light.  No evidence of coolant leakage or cracks in tank.
Dealer sees no visible sign of leak around thermostat housing or
waterpump. Pressure tests ok when hot.
Looks to be about a couple of tablespoons or so in pan on garage floor
each night, so it's not gushing.  I drive only about 6-10 miles a day to
office @ 70 mph on highway.
Any other thoughts before I bite the big one and have them take front
end off engine?  If pump fails when on road what will happen other than
rapid rise in engine temperature?
If waterpump really needs to be replaced what is reasonable price?

P.S.
Someone suggested that I sleep under the car and see where it's leaking.
(What a silly suggestion. Doesn't everyone sleep under their 928?)

"Hi:
1986 928 S 78.000 miles.
Coolant leak which shows in pan placed under car in garage.
Only appears overnight.
Porsche dealer has had it in twice and pressure tested cooling system
when hot.  All tight.
Dealer sees evidence of coolant leak but cannot see anything leaking.
Suspects it is the water pump.
Mucho dinero if so.($1500)
Does not want to tear into it until he can figure out where coolant is
coming from.
Again, coolant collects in pan on garage floor at home overnight.
Uses about a quart every 200 miles.
Any ideas?
Thanks a lot.
Bruce"
