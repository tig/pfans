Aha, this is a good idea!   I'm game!

Also please note that we should all start parking in the lot, and maybe
bringing our car covers as well to minimize the gawking factor.  Madison's
car got keyed (very small spot) last time when parked on the street.  FWIW
there is hidden away parking I think on Spear St. by the Harbor Lofts
condos.  I'll check for better parking.

I got dibs on one space next to Jim's car (just breathe and the alarm goes
off!)
