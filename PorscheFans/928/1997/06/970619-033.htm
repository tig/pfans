|I have a question about the GT springs. I have an '89 GT and was going to
|change the springs to the Weltsminster ones from automotion. Am I taking the
|better springs and putting on springs that won't help the car. In other
|words, are the GT springs better then the Weltsminster? 
|Thanks,

No, the weltmiester spings are *MUCH* stiffer than the stock springs or a car
like mine that had the factory "sports" package. If you are not going to AX or
track your car I recommend that you DONT upgrade. The reason is that it WILL
lower the car by about 1". I REALLY like the Automotion springs but it does
make the ride stiffer. If you want a handling/performance upgrade though,
those springs will have a bigger impact than ANYTHING else you could do to the
car. Probably one of the cheapest too!

Good luck in your choice.
