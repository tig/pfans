True enough, and I would dearly like to have the manuals on CDROM, but I'm
not holding my breath. I want my shop manuals sooner rather than later. If,
after I get the printed manuals, they release CDROM version I would likely
buy it too. After all, if and when Porsche goes this route they will likely
try and leverage the expense by including all 928 related info such as
complete parts listings. This way they can market it to their dealers as
well. (They may even throw in an AVI file or too promoting, yet again, the
new Boxter)
