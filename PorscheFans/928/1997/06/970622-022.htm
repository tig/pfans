Left and right mostly, and almost airborne a few times.

	Caught, by the E-mail police. I knew that would wake at least one person up. 	

	
	 Phil was trying to prove the GT as a worthy competitor (to the S4). Although 
he said I did disappear around a few tight ones. Famous last words, "We were 
only at 5/10ths". Actually I don't have a G meter yet, but when I do I will 
publish my findings, and maybe a video with Phil being the chase vehicle. On 
another note, I autocrossed my car today in Monterey CA, and was inducted into 
the 49 second club. Very few street cars can make this one, and of course my 
time was 49.977, so I just managed to squeek by. Thank Zuffenhaussen for the 
220 code under the rear mat! There were only 
3 P-cars out there today, me (928 S4) ,a '75 911, and a 914 that spun so hard 
he got lost! It was tons of fun, or should I say 3,505lbs. of fun. Anyway if 
you have not autocrossed yet, beware, it is rubber shredding fun! Phil Tong; 
once you get your car online, we will have to start a little wager, you know, 
pink slips, motorcycles, houses, wives, whatever?! See you at the Parts Heaven 
/ 928 swap meet!
