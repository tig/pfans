Except if you have a 78 or 79 car, the use of the tool is CRITICAL.
This is because the tensionner does not compensate for a belt that
is too thight or too loose.  It only adjust itself by the temperature
change it sees.

Can it work without it, yes but what will be the cost if it fails??

The tools can be found for ~$400 and some place actually rent it 
(Talk to DEVEK).  There is also an add for a NO-NAME tension tool
that surfaced in the last excellence magazine.  We should probably
look into it and, if I bought one, I would buy the "calibration spring"
from Porsche to check the performance of the tool.  We might want
to ask this question on the 944 list as there is more of them and they
need the tool even more than we do...
