Hello all,
How's the GT Phil? Saw picture--NICE!-- Has same interior colors as mine
(dark blue and grey) I like the light blue exterior color too. (mine is
called diamond blue metallic, but isn't really blue at all) Go figure. 
Iv'e also had questions specific to corner balancing my car and would like to
do, or have it done (properly) to my car. If I opt to let someone else do it,
the problem is finding someone with proper equipment and know how. (Lex., Ky.
is not exactly the supercar capital of the world)  Now if I decide to do it
myself, the main problem is the scales. (or so I thought)  But, reading the
manuals again, I see where it says " The adjustment facility is used to
correct differences between left and right wheel loads. If  the height is
correct, the differences in wheel load are within a permitted tolerance as
long as the coil springs on each axle are the same length (spring pretention)
Tolerance +/- 1mm . It is possible to keep the differences in wheel load as
low as possible if wheel load scales are used."  So, do I understand this to
essentially mean that if the height measurements are equal side to side, then
it's pretty darn close and scaling it is not really a must do?  Obviously,
the goal is to have 1/4 of the cars total weight on each corner (should I
simulate my weight in the drivers seat?) with the most important being side
to side.
Anyway, what I initially got on here to share with you all, is a site that
explains how to do this using graph paper under the tires (seems like it'd
work) Check it out....

I know, it's a 911 site, but it relates. Also has some good info. regarding
cruise control problems.
All this talk about the Microbrew place is making me thirsty, I only wish my
local didn't prevent my attendance.
I have back surgery 7-17 (pinched nerve-- clutch leg is no good)  so hoist
one for me!
Stephane, good to see you've got the brakes under control.
Till I type again,
