Re: Randy's comments on the fragility of 928 five speeds:  I'm am currently
on my sixth 928 and have driven them over three hundred thousand miles. Two
had automatic transmissions and the other four including my current 87S4
had/has five speeds.  I have NEVER had either transmission or clutch
problems with any of the five speeds on which I've put about a quarter of a
million miles jointly. That includes the 85K I have put on the one I'm
driving now.  

I drive them hard but don't abuse them.  I can only surmise that anyone who
has constant problems with the 5 speeds is doing just that.  I did have
transmission work done on an 83 with automatic, but even that was only about
three hundred dollars.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a five speed to any
prospective buyer.

I can think of a bunch of other things to warn about but the transmission
isn't one of them.
