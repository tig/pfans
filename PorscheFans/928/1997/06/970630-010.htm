Why don't you switch your amplifier directly with the radio?  Most
radio have a positive feed that come on only when the radio is
turned on to raise the electric antenna.  this would have avoided
your problem.  If this is not available on your radio, which I doubt
very much, use feed from any "switched" accessory.  This should
not overload your circuit as the power to the amp comes from the
other positive connection.

Hope this helps,
