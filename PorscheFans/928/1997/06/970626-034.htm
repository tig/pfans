First off, let us give thanks for this list ... 

Second, can someone please tell me where the manual trans. fill/check is 
located on a '84 928 S Euro. I don't have a manual but have managed to find 
one for an American '83 928 S, but there are many differences (dual dists, 
exhaust, etc) and from the picture shown in the manual I can't find the darned 
thing for the life of me! I'm really starting to think hard about getting a 
fiche reader, because there is no one I can take my car to :( The closest 
Porsche dealer is almost 2 hours away and last time they had my car they had 
it for almost a month to change a timing belt (they kept screwing up, belt 
started shredding, not a happy, happy, joy, joy time). Anyways if someone 
could help me out I'd be super happy!

Third, great web page Phil Tong, keep it up!

P.S. There was one local mechanic here that I tried and this was his response, 
"Oh, that's one of them air cooled jobs, nope I don't work on them", my 
response "Thank you very much buh-bye"
