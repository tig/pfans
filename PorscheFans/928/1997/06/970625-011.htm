Yup, scales is the big problem - second biggest problem is a level
surface.  I'm still working on it - first pass this weekend suggests I
can't do much better than +/-50-100 lbs difference L to R.  More
investigation needed.

Yes, if your L&R spring lengths (when compressed with the same force)
are identical - to the extent they aren't, you need to balance.  Also,
if the chassis has some twist, height will not equate to balance.

Nope - you want something close to the same ratio front to back on both
sides - this isn't exactly right (more later) but it's close.

That precision is not very useful - adding a passenger or luggage will
throw it off by that much as will nearly any road surface variations.

Yup, this will show big problems - clearly more accurate (but the same
general idea) is to use the same tire (e.g. the spare tire) on all 4
corners and then I'd measure deflection rather than the area.  Perhaps
the above works well on a '72 911 but with low profile tires that have
stiff sidewalls, you'll have some pretty big errors if your pressures
(and sidewall stiffnesses) aren't the same.  But first, you need a level
surface.

Give me some more time,
