Hello! I'm new to the list. I've been lurking for a few days,
but am now ready to make my first post (now that I can see that
you are a nice bunch).  :^D

I think I might be buying a 928 soon. I have always wanted
one, but being only 33 have not always been able to afford it.
As it is, it will have to be one of the older specimens.

Actually, the funny thing is, I am looking for a car that is
worth *less* than my current car ('95 Z-28) so that I can use
the equity I've got in it (it's paid off) to get rid of some
credit-card debt. I hope to get $16,000 to $17,000 for the
Z-28, then get a 928 for about $10,000. That will leave $4,000 to
$5,000 to pay off the debt (we recently had a baby, for whom my
wife stopped working so she could stay home with him; then I was
out of work for 2.5 weeks, and the people who laid me off still
owe me for 2.5 weeks pay; needless to say we ran up the credit
card) and $2,000 to play with on either end. I'm very handy with
cars, so I am not daunted by the cost of repairs. I will be
handling most of those on my own.

Hmm, I see I've told my life story. Sorry. Anyway, I did have a
couple of questions. First, what was the last year for the
'phone dial' wheels? I like those. Also, what was the last year
for the early-style taillights (like those on the red 928S
pictured at http://www.928s4vr.com/)? I want to know this because
I want my 928 to have those particular characteristics, but I also
want the latest year-model I can afford, and I want to weed out
the later vehicles from for-sale listings that don't have pictures.
Actually, the wheels aren't mandatory, but the taillights are. With
a budget of $10,000, however, I probably won't get into the
later-style taillights anyway.  :^D  But it would be helpful to
know to ignore all 928's newer than (say) '86.

I hope to at least get into an S model, and maybe an S4, but I
doubt I can get an S4 for $10,000.

When my wife and I were kicking around the idea the other day
of selling the Z-28 and getting something older for me to free up
some cash, I had been thinking of older Camaros and Firebirds,
or maybe a restored 60's musclecar, but I couldn't really get
very excited about any of those, and then it hit me - why not
a 928? After all, I don't drive the Z-28 much since I usually
take the bike to/from work, so the 928 being ~12 years old
wouldn't really be a problem. It could be somewhat a hobby
car. And I've always wanted one. Besides, I'm getting tired of
cars like my Z-28. I can't fault its performance (the brakes
especially are quite good) but I simply long for a car with
a little more grace, character, and refinement.

Oh, and here's a funny thing - I never really cared for Porsches
until I saw the 928 (I was what, 17?) and then I was absolutely
smitten. I knew that I would have to have one someday.

When I got out of college, I bought an '89 Formula 350, and
then we got the Z-28 in '95. But these were mere shadows of
the car I really wanted! In fact, I had thought of getting a
928 when I got the Formula, but at the time they hadn't
come down quite enough. (the Formula, though loaded out,
was really quite an inexpensive car)  When we bought the
Z-28, I had just sort of forgotten about it by then.

I still need to drive one to be sure I'll like it, although
I bet I will! e.g. I do need to make sure I will be comfortable
in it, as I am 6'2" and 255 lbs. I probably will be fine,
though - the 928 and Z-28/Formula seem to be sized similarly.

Well, I'll stop rambling. It's late and past my bedtime. This
is what happens when you post when you're tired - you get
running-mouth disease.  :D
