Adjusting the timing on our 4 valvers is done by loosening the cam gear 
(3 screws) and rotating it in relation to the cam lobes.  This is not
for
the faint of heart as you cannot do this with a timing light.  You need
to take the cam cover off, place an adaptor and measure the cam lobe 
position in relation to the cam gear.  Then, you put the belt back
on and hope you get the results you wanted.

I learn this by mistake when I changed my t-belt.  I tried to reroute
some
wires and pulled the cam gear off.  I put it back almost right, but my
timing
is a bit off ;-(
