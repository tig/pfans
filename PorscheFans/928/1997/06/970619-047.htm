Hi Fernando.  It's funny that you mentioned a parts car.  I have looked
at a 85 with 95k on it that is in good shape, with the major expception
being the fact that it needs an engine.  The owner has no clue what she
has, she the orginal owner, too!  She drove the engine with no oil and
trashed it, it has zero oil pressure and it sounds like a bucket of
bolts.  The rest of the car is very good.  I was the last to drive the
car almost a year ago.  I drive by it every day to work.  She'll take
$4000 for the car, I'm sure.  Last night while reading the new issue of
Panorama I saw a parts ad for an 85 engine with 45k miles on it for
$1500, out of PA (I think). This is the lowest price I have seen.  The
dimantlers want $4000 to $5000 for an engine.  Any 85 or 86 engine will
do.  If I had the money I would buy it myself.  Its red with black
leather, power everything and ABS.  Interior is okay, exterior
excellent.  It's in Northeastern CT, about 45 mins out of Hartford.  


I'll be at Lime Rock on Aug 21 with CART.  It's an open track day so you
can run anything you want.

Let me know if youre interested in either.
