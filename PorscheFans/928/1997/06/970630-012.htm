Derron, the tool is sold by EuroSpeed and can be found advertised in
June
97 Excellence.  I have asked the 944 list, as well as this one, to see
if 
anyone actually used the tool.  So far, nobody has but a few people 
volonteered there service to test the tool against the real thing.

I had the part # for the spring but lost it...  

When I did my belt, I had someone that had the tool come to my house and
measure the tension.  I also remember that DEVEK will rent the tool for 
a very reasonable price if you do not wish to buy the tool.

When instaling the belt, I was surprise on how hard it was to put the
thing on.
The belt is almost tensioned just by slipping it in!!  To help make the
procedure
easier, you should have 2 2? mm wrenches to hold the cam gear in TDC
position.  You
will find that this position is not a stable one as it has some spring
compressed and
it aways want to turn on you.

Once you have everything in place, turn the belt a few turns and make
sure that the belt
still have the right tension AND that you are still lined up with your
TDC.

I also recommend doing the waterpump and thermostat while you are in
there.  For this, you
will need the waterpump gasket and thermostat O-ring(s) (there is 2
o-ring on the thermostat.
the big one that seals the housing and a smaller on in the back that
seals the thermostat to
the engine block.  The later was dried up in my 85...).

If you cannot find a copy of the service manual prior to the procedure
(and are still willing
to attempt the job), you might want to find the Mitchell book for your
MY.  The description
in Mitchell is almost an exact copy of the factory manual...  It also
have good illustration
if, like me, you end up with your manual on Microfiche.

Lastly, You will need a flywheel lock to do the job (~$12).  If you have
problem finding this
one, let me know and I will send you the part #.
