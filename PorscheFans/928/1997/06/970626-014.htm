Hi,

I'm still trying to get my 79 euro 928 past emissions and registered.  I
took it to get a cat put on, and the shop said that even an American 928
didn't have a cat in that year.  Is this true?  If anyone has a US 79 or
80 928 that does have a cat, can you tell me where it is mounted?
It is also over spec on CO (4.6%, only 4% allowable) It has Bosche
K-jetronic injection(CIS) Is it easy to adjust?

As an aside, I replaced my leaky clutch slave cylinder yesterday. Pretty
straight forward until I got to the bleeding part.  After trying
manually bleeding, and suction bleeding with no effect, I rigged up a
pressure bleeding system as was described on the list a while back, and
it worked in a few seconds.  Being on this list is a real benefit.
Thanks!
