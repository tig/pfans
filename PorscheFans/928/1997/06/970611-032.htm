Hello folks;

I am sorry to add to the ever continuing list of e-mails regarding
struts and springs, but here it goes.

My mom (bless her heart) is buying me struts for my birthday (I've been
out of the house and graduated from college for some time now, and my
folks still make a big deal about it... :^)
I opted for the OEM boge turbo gas struts.  I got them from Onboard
Racing for 190 a pair for the fronts and 199 for the rears.  I decided
on the OEM's because I was told that the Koni's don't last all that long
(this may be untrue, but at 250-300 PER CORNER!!! I didn't want to
chance it.)
My question is this:

Since my springs have to come off anyway, I was wondering about those
spring kits that automotion has on sale.  I will be doing autocrossing
in the near future, but I also drive this thing everday to work during
the good weather months (at the first sign of snow its off to the
garage...)  So, I have 2 to chose from (or none at all).  THe 270lb
weltmeisters for the fronts only (won't that make the car look sort of
goofy?) and the full on 415/270 weltmeister kit that lowers the whole
car about 1".

How does this affect the driveability of the car on the real world roads
of boston?  I know it will make it an autocrosser par excellece, but
(see above...)

Thanks for all your help.

PS:  JUst did my first PCA NER rallye this weekend , and my girlfriend
and I were the Novice winners!
