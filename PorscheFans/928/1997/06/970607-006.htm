This post won't be too long so as not to take up too much bandwidth.  Out of
the 1900+ people that are a member of the 928 and or 911 mailing list I have
received one (1) very rude complaint (about me posting a joke) ordering me to
"never do that again."  Just in case anyone else was offended and didn't make
it known I wanted to send an E-mail out to apologize to everyone.  I thought
that this list was a little more personal and lighthearted than this, maybe I
was wrong.  Occasionally people on the other lists that I am a member of send
jokes or funny things out of newspapers, magazines, etc., and it's seen for
what it is- a joke.  These lists aren't so serious that we can't have a
little fun are they?  If they are then I think we should all post questions
and responses that are perfect both in spelling and grammar and leave out our
home/business addresses, phone numbers, E-mails, and the little personal
quotes such as "Dear Santa, All I want for Christmas is your list of naughty
girls."  (Which I liked, BTW)  If it comes to that then go ahead and cancel
me from the lists.  People in America used to be able to be friendly and
express themselves without being attacked.  If the complaint is about taking
up too much bandwidth then I would be happy to send $1 a month to the person
who generates this list (if all of us did that, I know $2000 a month would
run it). 
Off my soapbox now.
