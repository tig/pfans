>I love the scene where he's backing the 928 out of the garage, and

Just for clarification, the song playing in this scene is "The Pump" by
Jeff Beck.

>but it served to introduce me to the 928. 

I had just fallen in love with the 928 before the film was released (Summer 
'83) When I saw the car in the film I remember how exciting it was. (Not 
even to mention how exciting it was to see the love scene on the train
with Rebecca DeMornay) I now have a framed copy of the poster in my 
hallway. The 928 in the poster is black even though the one in the film is 
gold.

>It was actually a pretty stupid movie, if you think about it

Stupid? This is not a movie discussion list but I must say that to those of 
us in high school in the early/mid-80's "Risky Business" is a classic.
