I just came from my friends house in Jersey City.  It's a 1 hour drive 
each way from where i live.  Boy did it feel good.  I tried really hard 
not to go over 90.  My car is far from perfect but it just felt good to 
cruise somewhere in this comfortable car.  I found out that my cruise
control works fine (but why bother).  This is the first time i took a
trip in the old girl and it is true the car does feel lighter the faster 
you go.  I also found out that the car needs new shocks.  Thanks to
those who helped with my questions.  I found the cause for the
speedometer not working.  the wires that came from the sender that go
through the spare tire area broke.  Now if i can find out what the hell
is wrong with the signal lights i might be adventurous enough to take a
ride up to Boston or maybe down to D.C. decisions, decisions.  i love
that car.
