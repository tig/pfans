Mellow Greetings, All!

     I have been reading yall's messages nearly everyday for over a month
now, and I just got my first Porsche, a 1982 black/black 928!

     It is almost in perfect condition (even the clock works).  The main
thing that I would like to fix on it is the leather-covered dash.  The
leather is all shrunken and pulled back tight.  How much should I expect it
to cost to replace that, and where should I get it done?

     The only other thing about it is that about 5 years ago or so, the
woman who owned it then took the Blaupunkt out and put in an adequate
Kenwood cass. and new speakers.  The stereo doesn't fit right in the spot
(it's too small), but the main thing that gets me is the new speakers.
     She didn't put the new door speakers where the old ones were.  Instead,
she had them drill a couple holes in the plastic door insert thing (don't
know the name for it) close to the door handle!  =:o  The speakers sound
great and all, but the sound feels weird only coming from behind me and
right to my side, nothing in front.
     I looked in TWEEKs and Performance Product catalogs, but I didn't see
Blaupunkt speakers that'd fit the 928.  Also, where should I look for new
panels to go where she had the speaker holes drilled?

     Thanks very much!  I am really enjoying being a 928 owner and look
forward to fixin' mine up completely.  :)

Be Well,
Dan
