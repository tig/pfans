Leonard, Are you sure that the ignition is modified by the control
module?  I do
not see how this can be achived when the distributor is bolted to the
camshaft.
The rotor cannot be advanced or retarded in any fashion that I could see
so timing
needs to be done mechanicaly...

I think that your programing was more on the fuel side, but I could
(can) be wrong.
If you can clear my misunderstanding, I sure would like to know because
I am about
to open my camshaft cover to redo the timing so that the car can perform
to its
full potential.
