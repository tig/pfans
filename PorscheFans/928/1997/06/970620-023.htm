  Forgot about those, although on my car, they were just small pieces
  fastened by sheet metal type screws.  Easy to remove and install.
  Now that you mention it, I probably had to remove the shield above the
  cat as well.  Must have been easy to do, otherwise I would have
  remembered it being a difficult piece of the task.

  I didn't drop the cat because I had an air pump tube that fed it.  The
  connection between the two was very stubborn, so I decided to leave
  it in place rather than risk stripping something.  Obviously anything
  you can easily do to gain working space is going to help with this job.

  Cool.  I think lots of complaints about overpriced parts helped get
  PPE initiated.
  
  Let me know how it goes.
