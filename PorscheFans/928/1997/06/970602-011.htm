I found the cause of my sluggish transmission, and the fix was so easy I have
to pass it on!  I thought I would look over the linkages and connections before
taking it to the dealer for the recommended transmission adjustment.  I was
ready to give up, when I decided to look at the throttle pedal.

The pedal was rubbing against the center panel at anything over half throttle
position, and it difficult to reliably press the kickdown switch.  Readjusting
the angle of the pedal away from center helped a little, but it still wasn't
right.

Pulling the pedal off the linkage, I then loosened the locknut and expanded the
linkage, making it about a quarter inch longer.  This has the effect of
leveraging the pedal, ensuring that full throttle is obtainable.  To top it
off, I put a half inch piece of rubber hose on the bar which depresses the
kickdown switch, facilitating early and reliable engagement.

Just doing this now has both vacuum and switch kickdowns working great.  For
instance,  on the way to work this morning I was stuck behind a pickup truck
doing the posted (slow) ramp speed.  When the ramp opened up a lane at the end,
I punched it, getting a double kickdown that just _launched_ the car.  In two
or three seconds (and a couple of near red line shifts) the other vehicles were
specks in the mirror, including a Jaguar who was on my tail.  Wow, that was the
first time I heard the feisty five liter scream - yes commuting can be a joy!
 I wonder if any of retired guys who previously owned this car ever felt _that_
rush?

Can't wait to get the car out to the track now, but first I think I'll install
the secondary kickdown switch as recommend by Patrick for ensuring first gear
engagement.  It seems a lot more practical that changing the transmission's
valve body - definitely worth trying first on transmission with only 31K on it.
 I can't see how it would be too harsh on the tranny.

Anyway, that's my tip for the day - it's nice to know this car can *rage* as
well as play nice.  You know, I'm liking this car more and more...
