That's good to know. Hopefully it was '85, since I am looking at '86
models!  :^D

I suppose I could retrofit the later seat mounting hardware if it is an
issue.

The biggest mistake I ever made was getting the electric seat on my
Z-28; it added unwanted height. My '89 Formula did not have this;
rather it had a neat 4-way adjustable seat that moved the usual
front-back and also it 'rocked' forward-backward as a unit. That, plus
the reclining seatback feature, made for a very comfortable seat.
Lighter than electric as well. I could have gotten this on the Z-28,
and I should have. Oh, well. Now that I am selling the Z-28, it will
add to the resale value.
