Sorry...I just don't want to see our discussions go the way other groups
(totally unrelated) have gone. We're obviously above that mentality. I
mean, face it...we were all wise enough to choose a 928! That, in itself,
is an indication to me that we're also wise enough to research our own 
archives while searching for answers.

My point is that the URL

http://www.porschefans.com/Archives.html

is _the_ place to start. We search, we cut, we paste and we build our own
private archives of relevance. We have the raw material, we have the tools
and we know how to combine them.
