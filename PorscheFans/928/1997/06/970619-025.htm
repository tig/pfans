:^^D

Yes that's right.  My favorite scene is when Tom has the hooker & Booger
(name from a different movie) in the car and is being chased by the pimp in
the Caddy.  After he loses the Caddy he pulls to the side (with great
lighting effect here - reveal from a shadow) he turns to >the hooker and
says:  "Porsche, there is no substitute".

Hey this movie was the whole reason I purchased a 928 I saw the movie in
1986 and was struck immediatley,  I have for the last 10 years sat with my
mouth gaping open everytime I saw a 928 drive by. I would salivate at 928s.
Then 2 years ago I had just purchased a 1995 Rodeo for my wife (excuse to
buy my Porsche), When I was Driving down Reseda Blvd in Van Nuys, CA. And,
there she was a 1986 928s black /w black leather chrome on the head light,
I was in awe. My wife said go ahead, check it out. I had not known that
these beauties were V8s. When I turned the ignition and heard that roar,  I
could not let go of the steering wheel go. I had to drive it home. I
practically sat in it and did the paperwork. it had 120,000 miles on it but
the body and interior was in very decent shape. I had the engine checked
out (very good shape)
I constantly was and wax it  now, I always get suprised faces when non-928
owner are shocked that it is over 10 years old. It was all I ever wanted in
a car. I am about to purchase another 928 in the spring, must be a V8-32v.

Note: Thanks to you guys on this list, I finally discovered the kick down
buttton.  It was covered by a piece of carpet that had fallen from it's
clip. I removed the carpet and MAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNN!!!! What a smoker!
