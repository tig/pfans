Far from it. Porsche has worked with the tire makers from which it buys (as
have
GM, Toyota, and most other serious car companies) to develop
special-to-Porsche specifications for tires which may also be available in
the same model and size but not to that spec.

Porsche's tire specs, usually designated by "N0" or "N1", dictate slightly
different tread and sidewall construction, with handling and heat
resistance primary concerns. The fine print next to the tire sizes in the
Tire Rack ad carry such specs; for example, you'll note that several sizes
of the Michelin MXX3 are available both with and without that spec, with
the spec tires being (surprise) somewhat more expensive.

I've tried spec and non-spec tires on my car and believe I can feel the
difference, with the spec tires coming out crisper handling and more linear
in braking.
