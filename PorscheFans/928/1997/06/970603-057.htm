Hey guys, 
Haven't posted to the list in a long time, but read it religiously every
day.  I have some questions, Leonard probably has the answers, or I hope
someone does.  First off, how does one remove the fuel injectors?  Do they
just pull out?  Remember, this is a 78 with K-Jetronic.  Next, the engine
model number appears to be M28-12.  What is this?  I was told by the PO
that the 80 Euro had been installed.  Next question:  Was the clutch
pressure plate an energising type with centrifugal weights on it?  Mine
appears to have them.  I have tried to find a dealer who lists this and
have not had any luck.  My car appears to have had some mods applied by the
or other PO's, as well as some things done to bring it into the US, as it
was a grey car.  It is the only Porsche that I have ever owned, actually
the only one that I have ever driven, so I don't have an experience base. 
But I am learning.  I have redone most of the electrical system.  When I
got the car, it had a lot of burned wires and even some sections cut out of
various portions of the harness.  After the electricals, I will attack the
vacuum system.  Nothing works on this.  However, the 928 is the most
exilerating car ever.  (That's after I began driving sports cars in 1959,
with an Allard J2X, continuing up to my last one before the 928, an 85
Maserati BiTurbo).  Enough of that.  TIA for any help.

Dave Nicholson
