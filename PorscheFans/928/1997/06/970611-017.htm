I think it's much better but can't be sure because 3 of the 4 shocks
were leaking when I got the car.  Certainly the springs improve the roll
and dive of the car enhancing the stability.  On twitchiness, I didn't
consider it that and I believe, unless using some toe-out, it'll be hard
to make this 3500 lb car truly twitchy.

OTOH, BTDT this weekend by missing the late apex on the off-camber turn
9.  You gotta remember to get back on the throttle some (or both feet in
if you lifted way too much).

I don't think I made a dent in them - I'm guessing 15 or more track days
at the current rate.  I was still taking it easy as the hp and R1's
allow really high speeds with this car - I'm nowhere near the level of
the instructors but a few of our exit speeds (and certainly straight
away speeds) were significantly faster than theirs (2 E30 M3's & a 911)
- that's just hp and tires "helping" a crumby driver which, of course,
means you can easily get yourself into big trouble.

I agree a LSD helps a lot for rough areas.  The boot however has been
entirely repaved and is soooo smooth now - didn't experience it before.=20
The toe is an amazing corner - a hairpin which rises about 50 feet from
turn-in to track out.  The steep downhill instep turn keeps your
interest too of course.

Yup, I'd prefer shortening an old set to cable-tying them out of the
way.

Thanks for reminding me about this one.

I'd feel much better if you could lock 'em but would choose not to.

Yup, I changed coolant before these events and probably ended up near
60% water and 40% antifreeze.  Griff Miller responded that the
antifreeze lubes the waterpump seal - it also raises the boiling
temperature.  The potential for boiling fluid is really bad because
local hot spots form a vapor which reduces the cooling at the hot spot
so that it heats more and ....  So I suppose if you can be sure that
pure water will conduct enough, you'd win but it's probably a risky
game.

Perhaps, but it does operate just as you'd expect.  Mostly it'd be a
calibration issue as I think these usually fail in an all or none mode
(independent of engine temp).  It's pretty clear the car was running
much hotter then than on the highway.

Thanks for all the suggestions,
Kurt
