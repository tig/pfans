Sorry for the confusion; I made too sweeping a statement.

The '78-86 Euro cars have three lights at the outside ends of the nose,
arranged from outside in: turn signal (also functions as a parking light),
fog light, driving light. What you tell me indicates that the light police
were extra-active during this time in the US, leading Porsche to omit the
true driving lights from this trio, creating instead the redundant large
parking light you describe.

The S4 and later US cars have the same arrangement as the earlier Euro
cars, and the driving lights come on automatically (and, in fact,
non-defeatably) with the high beams (whereas at least some Euro cars have a
separate switch for the driving lights).

As on your car, the fog lights may be used with the low beams, but are
automatically switched off when you go to high beams. Putting all the above
together, if I engage my fog light switch and turn on the headlights, I
have low beam + fog lights, then moving the beam selector gives me high
beams + driving lights.

Sorry for any confusion. I'm cc-ing the list to make my expiation public.
