Amen!

Once upon a time, my car would "whoosh" when I removed the gas cap. During
that time, I also noticed the "buzz" from the fuel pump being louder than
usual, particularly after a hard run. I also noticed that acceleration was
not all I could wish.

Autosport Designs found that the vent valve for the gas tank was "in
backwards" and fixed that. Results? No "whoosh", no loud "buzz", and much
better acceleration. The fuel pump had been working hard trying to draw a
vacuum in the tank, which, in addition to the problems I'd observed, would
eventually have collapsed the tank.

This issue is well worth clearing up.
