It turns out that there is a trick plastic tab mechanism that holds 
the glass onto the mirror assembly on this '89. There is a very small 
( <1/4" X3/8") at the very bottom center of the mirror housing.  
Through this opening a screw driver( flat head) is used to rotate a 
notched plastic retaining ring.   This ring locks and unlocks the 
small plastic posts which snap fit into corresonding holes on the 
flat metal frame that is just under the mirror.  You can muscle the 
mrror by prying with a putty knife ( which will move the ring anyway) 
but this way is much more gentle and less likely to damage anything. 
You still must use the putty knife- but the glass will  come off much 
easier this way. After the glass mirror is removed, unscrew three 
bolts that hold a metal assembly to the housing and remove same.  
Remove all wiring  from this assembly. I had to cut all of the wires -
 8 I believe-  to get the  wire out of the post . You need to take 
the wire out so you can push this spring loaded threaded post down 
while turning it to rethread it.  Once all was free, I took  the  
mirror housing pivot frame to a vise , clamped to tight ( after I 
surrounded it with thick foam rubber)  and with FIRM ( that little 
spring is tough to compress !) downward pressure using a flat head 
screw driver in the center I was able to re-thread this pivot post.  

I made it as tight as I could and then backed it off a tad so that it 
would pivot as it was designed. After some wire spliceing ( heat 
shrink tubing on splices    highly reccommended)  and reassembly all 
was back to normal.  I can now see the Corvettes disappearing behind 
me from both sides.
