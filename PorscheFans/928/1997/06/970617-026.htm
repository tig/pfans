  I don't know about the transmission itself, but I have replaced the clutch on 
  my 5-spd. It was making a rattling noise. I decided to do it myself. I assumed 
  it was the throw-out bearing based on conversations on the old Porschefiles 
  list. The biggest hassle was that the PO had added headers to my car, this 
  meant that the clutch housing was not freely accessible. I ended up having to 
  loosen the headers at the exhaust manifold enough to drop the clutch housing. 
  Once inside I mostly learned as I went. I had the shop manuals, but they 
  assume that you can figure some stuff out yourself. After removing the clutch 
  assembly I decided that do to all the grief with the headers I was going to do 
  a bunch of while I'm in here stuff. So I also replaced the pilot bearing, both 
  disks (they looked measured to be less than half gone at ~70K miles, and the 
  manual says they wear more slowly as they wear out), and the plastic ball cup 
  for the top of the release arm. I think the clutch plates were $135 a piece 
  (from the dealer), the pilot bear was $10, the throw-out bearing was around 
  $150, and the little plastic cup was $3. (I picking these prices from memory, 
  so they may not be quite accurate). I haven't had any trouble since. Really I 
  probably only needed the throw-out and the plastic release-arm cup. So I 
  really don't consider the parts price of this operation outrageous. I bought 
  the car with 27K miles, did the clutch around 70K, and now have 87K, not too 
  bad I think.

I just read the posting about the 1st & 2nd. gearset being $2100 at dealer, 
but a "DEAL" at $850 at another parts source. And SOME MEMBERS chastised me 
for my posting on the "false economy"/"high cost to repair" on 5spd. 928 
transmissions!. You guys better read this last posting. $850 "deal" on 2 
internal parts?? Hell, I can completeley GUT a automatic if someone has burnt 
all the clutches and bands, completely rebuild for $2,500 by any reputable 
shop. Mercedes Benz, for their cars, only charges $2,500 for a COMPLETELY 
REBUILT/REMANUFACTURED auto with full MB warranty. 
 Add the "devastating" cost of a clutch job every ____ miles, and I'll take
the 1 second less 0-60 speed on a 928S4 with automatic transmission. So take 
that you 5spdr's :-)  Just kidding, thought I'd get you guys who wrote me 
worked up :-)

BTW, if any of you guys have to do SERIOUS internal parts replacement on a 
5spd, let me know what the total $$ cost of parts is at the "DEAL" source :-)
