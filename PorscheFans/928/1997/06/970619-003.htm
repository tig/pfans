You know, I've installed a relay in every one of my other cars with a
higher wattage element.  I just figured the Porsche would do well without
it.  Maybe I should have tested it huh?

Once again, more time and money you guys make me spend for making things
just right!!!

(I say "you guys" in response to an earlier post since I don't think anyone
has yet spent any additional money on their cars from my recommendations  : )
