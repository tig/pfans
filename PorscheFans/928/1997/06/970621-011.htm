Here are some close approximation of what you want.  Maybe some of the
list
member that have use locator service in the past can give you some
pointers
to find exactly what you want.

But, in case a close match to your dream is enough:

90 S4, auto, 18k miles, dark blue/blue lthr, $29,900 817-244-8988
95 GTS Auto(?), Silver/blue, 1000 miles!!  $69,500  417-831-9999
91 928 GT, Red/black, 5 speed, 15k miles $37,500 417-869-7000
91 GT , Red/black, 5 speed, 40k miles $34,000 919-269-5583
93 928 GTS, 5 speed, silver blue/blue, 23k miles 217-528-2277
93 928 GTS, auto, black/black, 22k miles 217-528-2277
87 S4, auto, diamond blue/burgundy, 64k miles 217-528-2277
89 928, Black/tan, auto 913-441-2138
84 928, auto, 72k miles, slate blue $19,250 513-851-5900

PS.  If anyone buys one of these car, I expect a finders fee consisting
of:
	If you are going through the St-Louis Area, 1 beer and a ride in your
	new beast!!

	Hey, I think its reasonable but we can negotiate ;-)
