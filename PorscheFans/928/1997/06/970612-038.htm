A lot of people have problem with their system because they loose
the vacuum to the actuator.  Another common problem is the lost of
signal from the from temperature sensor.  It is located at the
top of the duct leading to the alternator.  

If the temperature input are wrong, or you do not have vaccum control, 
the heat will come on.  The fan switch, for wnat I understand, is only
active in manual mode.  In auto, the system takes over until the
selected parameter, as perceived by the system and not you, are met.

Not much help but maybe some leads to solve your problem,

Good luck,
