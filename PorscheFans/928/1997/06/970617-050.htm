I ran across a nice 87' S4 today at a lot that has used BMWs and Porsches
in Watertown, MA, just outside of Boston.

It is silver, decent paint job (real shiny but has a few flaws here and
there) ,front bumper cover scratched up a bit.

Automatic, 89k miles
recent timing belt change and waterpump change

owned by enthusiast

Stainless exhaust, Autothority chipset
Momo wheel
18" 959 style wheels with Dunlop SP8000 rubber (they look nice)
black leather, good condition
alarm
Automotion spring package
Big orange brake calipers, I don't think they're stock
cell phone

I don't have the number of the dealership in front of me now, but if anyone
is interested I'll dig it out.

They are selling for $15,500 firm. Looks *real* nice, haven't taken it to a
mechanic though .

Email me if anyone needs info
