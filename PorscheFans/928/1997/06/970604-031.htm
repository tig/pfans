Quite a few advocate this but it's an easy way to get dirt in the system
or take dirt that was in the slave (lowest thing) and put it into the
MC.  YMMV but I really like the pressure bleeding and clean fluid coming
from the top.

(On our 525, w/o a pressure bleeder the only way to get pedal back after
we did what Stephane and his wife did, was to take the slave off, open
bleeder, push in the slave piston, and then try to hold it in while
tightening the bleeder.  That experience made me loathe bleeding
clutches - and my wife even more.  This is a factory recomended
technique but it isn't much fun.)

Congrats Stephane for having such a sympathetic wife!

Best,
Kurt
