<<I was wondering if anyone has sent there speedo gauge out to be repaired??
 My odometer has stopped and I'd like to get some input on where one would
send it out to be repaired. I talked to the folks at 928 International and
they said it was a gear inside the gauge that had failed and that I should
find a VDO repair shop to fix it.>>

Mark-
Whatever you do make sure you don't go to a Porsche dealer for this.  If you
do they are required by law to report that your car has an odometer
discrepancy, which will KILL the value of your car.  Make sure that you go to
an independent shop and that they don't have the VIN number to your car.
 That kind of stuff goes into the national Porsche computer database that
dealers use.  I had info of a wreck/total repaint given to me on a 91 C2
Turbo in this manner.  Good luck!  Check Excellence Magazine or Porsche
Panorama for VDO shops.
Talk to you later.
