I know you will get a lot of talk on this one.  I am going to my
mechanic over the dealer because:

1. My mechanic is factory trained
2. They do not look down on older (85) car
3. They want the business (the dealer is awfull unless you come in
	wearing an armani suit and driving a 911 TT and telling
	them you want three brand new car and to include a 15%
	commission just for standing there)
4. My mechanic use only Porsche part except for rebuilt
5. If I need help, my mechanic will take the time to talk to me and
	even get the factory book out and discuss my problem.
6. THE DEALER CALL MY MECHANIC WHEN THEY HAVE A PROBLEM!!!
