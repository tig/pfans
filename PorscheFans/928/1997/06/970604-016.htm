Hey guys!

It's been awhile since I've posted and many of you are new since the
time I started (mainly lurking) with this mailing list. I just thought I
would say thanks to all the people who give so generously of their time
and knowledge for the good of the group. Truly, of all the news groups
and mailing lists I have been a part of, this is by far the one with the
most useful content and the least petty arguments.

To bring everyone up to date regarding my (winter) restoration project:
I started with a 78 Euro that I purchased here in Regina, Saskatchewan
(Canada). Porches are very rare here, the 928 doubley so. The car looked
to be in overall very nice shape and had low milage (101k km ~ 62k mi).
Straight body, but very poor paint preparation. It appeared that whoever
repainted it had tried to save themselves some cash by doing a driveway
sanding job, followed by a reasonably good paint job. On a black car,
it's impossible to hide shabby preparation.

The interior was in great shape, but needed to be thoroughly cleaned
and, being an eighteen year old car, some minor repairs were needed.
e.g. re-glueing some interior panels etc. The motor was strong and had
just had all seals replaced and had many new electrical components. Runs
great, pulls like a freight train.

Over the winter I completely removed the entire interior. I broke down,
cleaned and polished everything from the dash vents to the tool kit. I
even dissembled things like the electric motor transmissions for the
mirrors for cleaning and lubrication. Most of the interior is now back
together and looks (and works) like new.

The car is now in the body shop, soon to have a fresh coat of paint.
They have had it for about three weeks, and when talking with the shop
owner yesterday, found out it will be ready Thursday of this week. I
also learned that there have been two fellows doing meticulous sanding
on the car for 6 days now. These guys are really taking their time and
doing a super job. Of course, when I was told what the final bill will
be, I nearly fainted. I don't know what the rates are like in other
parts of the world, but $6k seems like a fairly hefty price.

All in all, this has been a pile of fun. With the exception of the
bodywork, I do my own work and will likely do most of the mechanical
work that may crop up in the future. Sure, I have too much money in the
car, but if any car deserves excessive treatment, it's the 928.

By the way, what's the consensus on adding an 'S' rear wing? There was
the center section of wing on my car when I got it, and have obtained
both the sides pieces and all the required mounting hardware, but have
not really decided whether or not to put it on the car (I don't know if
I can bear to drill the required holes). If  I don't, I'll need the trim
for the bottom and sides of the rear window... anyone interested in a
trade?
