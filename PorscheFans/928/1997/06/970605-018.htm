The 85 has the same engine as the 86 (or almost?).  Both are 32
valves but the 86, after mid year, received improved brakes.

As for price, I paid less then 9K for my 85.  2 weeks before, they
wanted almost 12k for the car...  However, remember the saying
pay me now or pay me later.  A cheaper car at purchase might cost
you a lot of money to bring it up to speed (like I am finding out).

I do all my work except for consulting fee to my mechanics (this is
done mostly on a voluntary basis because that is their living and
their advice saves me money on the long run...)  This saves a lot
of money because you do not pay for time but you need to have the 
time to do it.

If you do all your work, get ready to do some shopping for parts.
Great discount can be acheived thrue mail order.  This can save you
quite a lot of money in the long run.
