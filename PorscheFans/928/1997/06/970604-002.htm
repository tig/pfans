Greetings,

Im experiencing a problem with my 87 S4 after a heavy rain and sometime
after a good car wash.  My guess is that humidity or steam builds up in some
humidity sensitive area and causes it to lose its ability to idle smoothly.
When it occurs, the car's idle will surge between 1200 and 0 (indicated on
the tach) and sometimes stall out completely.  Its recovery time varys but
eventually clears up.  While in the surging idle, strong fumes come from the
pipe (unburned fuel).  My guess is ignition, could it be a fuel problem or
anything else that could screw up the idle mixture when wet?

If anybody has had similar experiences, please post.  It's rain season here
in Florida.

Thanks,
Alan
