I can give no advice about the car itself.  However, in case you're
not already aware of it, owning a car in Japan (especially one older
than 10 years) is very expen$ive.  There's a reason older cars are so
cheap (especially consider prices in Japan)--any car older than 10
years must be inspected annually, and that inspection can run from
Y60 000 to Y180 000 (for newer vehicles, the inspection is required
only every 3 years).  Also, to get the vehicle registered you must
have proof of a permanent parking space (parking space is scarce and
therefore expensive).  I don't know about gas, but it's probably on
par with most of the rest of the world--i.e. heinously expensive by
US standards.  Don't know about insurance requirements/prices.  And
I won't mention our favorite, maintenance/repair costs...

So, the bottom line...  The car may be a great deal, but by the time
you add all the other costs peculiar to Japan, it may not work out
so great.  If you have the money, go for it.

Good luck!
