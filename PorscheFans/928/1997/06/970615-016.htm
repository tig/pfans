Hi Larry (& all P-Fans!)

The previous owner may have put 55-100 watt elements in them.  That could
be the answer to your low light mystery.

What I don't understand is when you wrote "and *his* has a chrome trim
ring around the lights".  Does that mean *you* don't have the chrome ring?
If you don't you should be VERY pleased.  But that would be impossible
since you said that you have H-4 lamps in it.  Did you mean H-5 or 9004???

For all of us poor saps in the US there was a crazy law forbidding the use
of any headlamps that were not sealed beams.  Due to this law Porsche had
to invent that silly ass chrome ring to take up the 1/2" space the 7"
(sealed beam) headlights did not fill.  You can buy aftermarket 7" lamps
that have interchangeable elements like the H-4 you mentioned, but stock
was sealed beam.  The headlights that were intended to be used were 8" user
replaceable element (H-5 or 9004) Bosch.  If my memory serves me correctly,
in 1987(?) the US lifted the law and Porsche started to import the 928s'
with the *normal* 8" lamps.

The Bosch 8" fills the area with the flat, big, impressive, functional tit
bearing lights.  That means when you turn on your lights or activate your
high-beams you can see (with the little *tit*) if you have a burned out
element or not!

I spent over $200 on each side to convert my headlamps from the 7" to the
8" because I wanted the better light output as well as the much improved
looks.  So be happy if you have the 8".  If you want brighter light output
for them, you can install 80-100 or possibly 90-130 watt elements.  They
will require a higher amperage fuse due to the additional draw.  Calculate
"watts divided by volts(12) = amps" to figure the proper fuses.  I'm told
the wiring will support the extra amps and I've been running 80-100s' in
mine for about 3 years without any problems.  (I also ran 80-100s' for 2
years in a '82 928 w/o problems.)

I'm not quite sure what your asking in your last paragraph.  It sounds
like you were entertaining the thought of taking out the 8" and swapping
them for 7" lamps.  DON'T DO IT!  It would be similar to replacing a
perfectly good 32 valve motor for a 16 valve.

Any corrections or additional info from anyone out there?
