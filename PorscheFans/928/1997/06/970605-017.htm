Here's the definitive answer from Roy Howell, chief chemist at
Red Line Oil:

>>You are correct that Porsche calls for a 75W90 GL5 gear oil.
I would have recommended the 75W90NS in your application, but if it is
working OK...then I wouldn't change. Does the car have limmited slip? If   
so
you would probably need a more slippery fluid than the NS, to reduce
chatter. My usual "Porsche" recommendation is 75W90NS, except with   
limmited
slip, then I recommend adding some Friction Modifier to just eliminate   
the
chatter. The 75W90 has friction modifier added , and is a slippery fluid,
the "NS" is Not Slippery. I hope I havn't confused you with all the   
above,
I know of others that are using 75W90 in gear boxes also with no problem,
so it seems to be all right.

GL5 is the specified fluid for the manual transmission.

I think he specified not to use the MTL fluid as it is also available
from Red Line.  If you ordered fluid without specifying GL5, you might
get the wrong one.  But I am assuming again :-O
