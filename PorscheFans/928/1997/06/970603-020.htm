Hey Roy,
To remove these trim pieces on my '83, I had to remove the sun visors which 
are held on by three screws.  Once the sun visors were off, I pulled the front 
of the headliner down.  I pulled the headliner down because it overlapped the 
A pillar trim -- but you may not have to do this as Vince has indicated.  Once 
the headliner was down, I could pop off the A pillar trim.  That trim piece is 
held on by three (if memory serves correctly) clips embedded in the trim.  
When you reinstall the trim pieces, make sure you get the foot of the trim 
piece neatly under the dash.
