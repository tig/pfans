So do more! German performance cars are designed to be driven really hard
(nothing harder than sustained top speed, you betcha). Your car literally
requires hard driving to stay healthy. There are no downsides apart from
fuel economy and tire life, and the upside includes far more fun. The 928
can provide a stunning experience, but you must give it the chance. The red
line is your friend!
