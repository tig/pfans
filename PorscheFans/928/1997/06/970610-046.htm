Kurt,

  Did you find the car as predictable in high speed sweepers with the=20
  Weltmeisters/Konis as it was with the stock setup?  I have a=20
  Weltmeister spring set (all 4 springs) that I'll install with new
  shocks eventually and I want to make sure I'm not going to go from
  very predictable handling to something that is twitchy and prone to
  a quick oversteer situation in off-throttle transitions.
 =20
  BTW, are the R1s still useable for another track event?  I'm curious
  about how much track time they can give.
 =20
  You've got me psyched for the next Lone Star Region PCA driver's ed
  at Texas World Speedway in August!
