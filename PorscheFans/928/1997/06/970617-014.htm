Cannot give advice on the 78 per say but it should be in incredible
shape to warrant $7500.

I paid $8,500 for my 85 in pretty good shape and I saw an 86 in much
better shape (too late though) for $8,600.  Price may be different
where you live and the car might be worth this much.  But try to
get the price down.  If the interior is not in very good shape, 
definitly ask for a price reduction.

PS.  As a 32 valves owner, I think they are worth the extra $$.  If
you are looking at paying around $7,500, try to find a 32 valve or 
a euro 16 valves.  You will thank me later for the additional power
you will get.

PPS.  If you are looking for a collector car, the 78 was the first year
that the 928 was made.  Will it ever be valuable???  only time will tell
