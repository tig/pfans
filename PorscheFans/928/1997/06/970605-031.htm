Thought everyone might like this:

Bill Clinton is visiting a school. In one class, he asks the students if
anyone can give him an example of a "tragedy". One little boy stands up and
offers that "If my best friend who lives next door was playing in the street
when a car came along and killed him, that would be a tragedy."

"No," Clinton says, "That would be an ACCIDENT."

A girl raises her hand. "If a schoolbus carrying fifty children drove off a
cliff, killing everyone involved... that would be a tragedy."

"I'm afraid not," explains Clinton."That is what we would call a GREAT LOSS."

The room is silent; none of the other children volunteer.  "What?" asks
Clinton, "Isn't  there any one here who can give me an example of a tragedy?"

Finally, a boy in the back raises his hand. In a timid voice, he says: "If an
airplane carrying Bill & Hillary Clinton were blown up by a bomb,*that* would
be a tragedy."

"Wonderful!" Clinton beams. "Marvelous! And can you tell me WHY that would be
a tragedy?"

"Well," says the boy, "because it wouldn't be an accident, and it certainly
would be no great loss!" >>
