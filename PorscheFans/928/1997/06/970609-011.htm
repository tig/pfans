     Funny... I just had this exact same problem a few months ago...  I 
     have an '83, but these instructions should apply.
     
     Go ahead and remove the glass and motorized insert per David Roberts' 
     instructions (from 6/7).  Once you have these pieces off, you'll see a 
     6-pin, round connector.  Everything is MUCH easier if you remove the 
     pins from this connector and pull the cable out of the mirror; you'll 
     need a pin extractor tool to do this.  Don't forget to label which 
     pins go where in the connector (the openings in the connector are 
     numbered).
     
     Once this is done, you can remove the mirror from the car.  Don't lose 
     the cable in the door!
     
     Now the problem is re-installing that hollow bolt that came undone 
     (and notice, without the motor wires in place, the mirror falls apart! 
      Hate to think of that happening while doing 65 on the highway)  The 
     large spring pressure makes it very difficult to thread it back in 
     place without the correct tool, which, if I remember correctly, is a 
     T-55 Torx driver.  You have to apply a lot of inward pressure while 
     turning to compress the spring and get the threads to take.  (The 
     factory manual indicates the proper torque for tightening, but I don't 
     have it in front of me).  Make sure the mirror is oriented correctly 
     relative to the base!
     
     Once the mirror is back together, thread the wires back through, 
     reattach the plug, put the motor and glass back in, and enjoy watching 
     those cars disappear in your dust!
