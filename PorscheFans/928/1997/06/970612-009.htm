	These lights are Xenon Lights and are expensive to retrofit on a older
car. You need: a new headlight, gas discharge lamp (D2S lamp), starter
transformer (24.000 V), controller (automatic vertical aim control AUTO
LWR) all these will be about 2.500DM. You do not need new wires because the
TOTAL consumption will be 45W !!! 

	Blue ion lights are normal halogen lights are direct replacement (no mods
equired) specially coated bulbs They are OEM spec. and offer a very clear
white light (instead of the standard yellowish light from original
equipment bulbs and they have a distinct blue glow that looks very
similar to  the ones with Xenon and cost 20$ each..... It is possibile to
be a
cheap imitation for Xenon. What you get is what you pay. 

Maybe is someone on the list who have experience with these blue ion lights
and can share with us...

 Hauca Alin
