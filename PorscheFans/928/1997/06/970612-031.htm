Brian,
Any size wheel, with the proper bolt pattern, offset and proper tire size 
(aprox. 25" tall ) will fit a 928.
The "Porsche Technician" is correct in part of his statement "Porsche has 
not approved 18" wheels for use on 928s" that is a fact. But to keep things 
in perspective "Porsche does not approve of anything that is not 
manufactured and or tested by Porsche" i.e., Aftermarket Chips, upgraded 
exhaust, larger tires, etc. This is common sense and is done by all 
manufacturers for "Liability Purposes". For example 17" wheels were only 
recently (few years ) "Approved for use on 928s" because they put them on 
the 92-95 "GTS" , now they are approved. (by the way a 92-95 GTS has to use 
17" or larger to clear the front (BIG BRAKE) caliper. I have seen many 928s 
with 18" wheels and no one has ever reported a problem. There are a few 
with 19" wheels. I personally am going to put SPEEDLINE ALISEO 3-Piece 18 x 
8 Front, and 18 x 10 rear using 225/40-18 front and 265/35-18 rear (same 
overall physical size as factory "GT" and "GTS" size). Go to your local 
Porsche dealership and look at the 3.6 Turbo and other "Special 911 Models" 
that is what is on them. If Porsche still made the 928 they would have 18" 
wheels on them.

P.S. If a 911 Suspension can handle it, (copy of 928 rear suspension, 
jab,jab) ANY 928 CAN HANDLE IT!!!


Just my opinion and experience, I could be wrong,
