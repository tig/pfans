I have a 1989 S4 (auto) 29K which has recently "cut out" while 
driving. Cruising at 65mph suddenly it seems to loose partial fuel 
and power but continues to be able to be driven but with considerable 
less power.

The Posrche dealer said the 928 will cut back on fuel if the temp 
sensor in the catalytic convertor senses the temp getting too high 
probable due to unburned fuel "burning"  in the catalytic convertor. 


Just had a 30K servicing after the first problem. Dealer checked 
everything and the car has been great for the last month.  Just had 
it happen again today!!

Both times it has done this after the battery has gone dead and had 
to jump start it. The car drives fine and then looses power. After I 
stop and shut the car off, the car restarts fine and has full power. 


Any thoughts??
