Hi All!

Kevin Jones <vividimg@bellsouth.net> says that he seems to have developed a
rattle
and cannot find what is causing it.
Clues: 
	It sounds like loose metal. A light sound, like it is a thin piece of
metal as apposed to a clunck that would come from a dense piece.
The noise is not constant. It is bump related.

Keven, I have what may be a similar noise. It is bump related and it sounds
just like a bit of chain jingling around. My mechanic said that I have
cracked brake backing pieces (the aluminium shields) and so I put it down to
these. I haven't had time to check further or fix them. But then your noise
goes when you lightly touch the brakes so maybe it is a totally unrelated
problem. Hope this helps you!
