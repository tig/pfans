Your chart started off fine but got hazier toward the end. The GT is wider
than the S4 (flared rear fenders), but the two cars are the same height and
length (your GTS numbers are correct for both). Your lb/bhp numbers are
off; how can the more powerful GTS have more lb/bhp? The correct figures
are 3593/345 = 10.4 lb/bhp for the GTS, 3505/316 = 11.1 lb/bhp for the S4
(using the weight and power figures from the factory spec book).

So, the GTS is about 7% more powerful by this measure. How much faster is
it? The factory says 168 mph top speed for the S4, 171 for the GTS.
Acceleration figures are harder to compare. I have a 0-60 mph quote of 5.5
seconds for the GTS and a 0-100 km/h (62.1 mph) quote of 5.9 seconds for
the S4.

Figures of this sort don't speak to the feel of response you get when you
suddenly mash the throttle, and the considerably higher peak torque of the
GTS engine should make itself felt here.

(See, everybody? I can in fact be nice.)
