i'm currently looking at a 89 model, auto, with 13k miles, he's asking

the used car guides seem off on porsche prices.>>

Henry- you can get some very accurate prices from me if you'd like.  I do
auto locating and brokering, specializing in Porsches.  The price this guy is
asking is way high.  I hate to say that but it's true.  My 87 928S4 was $70K
brand new (I have the window sticker) and is now worth considerably less than
that (although that does not cut down on the quality, style, performance, or
fun factor of the car).  I would need to know a few more details about the
car you are looking at- ie. paintwork, wrecks, options, etc... before I could
give you a definite price.  Let me know.  Just for reference I have a guy
selling a 1988 928S4 5-speed, 36K miles, red/full black leather int, rear AC,
never been wrecked, only the front bumper has been repainted from an
encounter with an over-zealous garage door opener, Gold 16" BBS rims with new
tires + the factory rims.  He is asking $20,000 for this car and it is NICE!
 It needs front brakes and a head gasket.

I also recently posted a question about a 91 928 GT that I knew of for sale
here in Indiana.  Red/black, 5-spd, very nice for approx. $27,000.
Let me know if you have questions.
