>>Hi Guys this is Ashley, I have a question about my 84, the tail lights
>>in the
>>back seem to be pushed in a little there is a small gap in between the
>>lights
>>and the body, do you think that it was rear ended at some time ?? also the
>>tail light warning is always on?? and the passenger side small light on the
>>side rear is out, how do I change that ? and one more thing the heater seems
>>to be on all the time, I live in southen calif so don't really need the
>>heater, can I just take out the fuse to the climate control ?? Thanks
>>Ashley..      

Looks like someone bumped your rear... the tail light assembly is bolted
on to the rear bumper.  You need to remove the rear bumper cover in
order to access it.  Check your bulbs to make sure they are all
'balanced'; same make and wattage for both side.  About the side marker
lamps, reach behind the rear of the wheel well.  Disconnect lamp holder
after removing the weatherproof boot.  On the heater being on all the
time, check your heater control valve; located close to the center
firewall behind the air cleaner assembly.  You need to remove the air
box in order to reach it.  Chances are the diaphragm is perforated. 
Another possibility is that you have constant vacumn to the heater
control valve, which causes it to open and allow hot coolant to
circulate in the heater core.
