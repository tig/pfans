>> The first time I drove on the Autobahn, I thought I was going fast when I
had the rental Golf floored and doing 110 mph. 

That is a pretty normal cruising speed in today's middle class automobiles in
Germany - if the traffic allows... (most of the time people can only dream of
it)

>> ...it was a Porsche 928, perhaps an AMG, as it had the all white bodywork
that was typical of them about ten years ago. 

I thought AMG would only do Mercedes cars. Maybe he saw a Strosek wide body
conversion?

>> Anyhow, I don't know how fast he was going, but he blew by me so fast my
car rocked back and forth in his wake.

Probably anything up to top speed - and this man got a good lesson in
aerodynamics. For the same reason you don't find beat-up pickup trucks with
wooden "sheds" mounted on their bed in Germany... ;-)

Sorry for being sarcastic!

>> After that, and to this day, I always  stay to the right no matter what my
cruising speed.

I love that one. It's the law in Germany anyway, but there are numerous
"environmentalists" and other "teachers" there, who see faster drivers as
"energy wasting bastards". They almost pretend to "own" the left lane and
want to teach us a lessen about what they consider "sensible driving". While
these drivers could be ticketed, those who tailgate or pass on the right can
get into even more trouble (suspension of license, etc.), if caught. 

It's nasty game, and today German police moitors traffic with unmarked police
cars. These can be anything fast, including powerful VW Golf GTIs, Audis,
BMWs, Mercedes and Porsches. I have personally seen a grey-metallic Audi 100
with a flip-up camera between the seats and a photo camera on the dash
(followed and photographed me a couple of years back), and a beige 944, but I
know they have several 911s now! They don't go after minor violations. So if
they stop you, they have proof of your violation on video, and might take
your license on the spot!

Unfortunately the Autobahn is no longer paradise - it's only some stretches,
mainly in states with a conservative government, and mainly on Sunday
mornings. The rest is either speed limited (96% of German roads are limited)
or too busy. An interesting innovation: Around Stuttgart they invented the
"intelligent road", a system that monitors traffic and weather conditions,
and sets the speed limit for each individual lane to maximize traffic
capacity and safety.

Sorry to hit you with this kind of reality. If it makes you feel better,
think about the Merceded Benz test drivers, who believed there was no speed
limit in Montana anymore, and got ticketed for going at "Autobahn speeds"...
