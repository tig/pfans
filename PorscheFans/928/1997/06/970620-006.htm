Sure, just repay another.

Yup on getting the suspension settled.  Nope on the diameter being the
same - as long as the diameter is close, the spring rate shouldn't
change significantly and therefore as long as the same "test tire" is
used on all 4 corners, the error due to the difference in it's height
vs. the normal tire will cancel.  (Of course, if your normal tires are
different from each other, that will affect the balance - a couple
32nd's of an inch might even be measurable.  Additionally, none of this
proves my procedure will work - I'll try it over the weekend.)

Absolutely - especially since it doesn't seem to affect the weight
transfer (that was the big surprise to me at least - it's of course
obvious in retrospect, as always).

A bunch of theory so far,
