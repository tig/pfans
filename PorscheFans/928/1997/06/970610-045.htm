Paul,
If it were me, I would buy a good used, or rebuilt Transmission, especially 
considering the estimate you have received.
I think P.A.P. in Atlanta may have a used one at decent price  $1200-$1500 
(770) 449-3146 ask for Wayne.
Vertex in Florida advertises rebuilt 928 transmissions for $1790 exchange 
w/6 month war. (305) 442-2727. I have done business
 with them and they seem very competent.

Good Luck,

David Roberts
