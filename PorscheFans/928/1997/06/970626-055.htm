Quick story:

Went out to eat with a female friend and was elected to drive her Acura
Integra (4 people, couldn't take the Porsche) which has a manual trans.

On the way home, I came to a stop sign at a blind turn.  Looked right,
no traffic.  Looked left, no traffic.  Pulled out a bit, looked again..
Nothing.

Then I pulled into the road.  Looked right, nothing. Looked left...
<insert thoughts>
Oh shit!!!!  A car!!  Way too fast, no way this one can stop in time.
(images of damage to my car flash, included were thoughts of pain,
money, insurance, etc..)
I'm sca-rewed!
<I pretty much froze at this point>
<continue thoughts...>
Hold on, I'm in the 928, not the Acura!!!
Dropdown switch!!!  Floor it!!!
<end thoughts>

I realized what car I was in, and knew I had a chance now.  Mashed the
pedal, turned the wheels to the left.
Car responded wonderfully, lit up on command.  Car launched forward. 
Still not enough to get out of the way.
Luckily, the power (and a bit of planned driver skill) enable the back
end to peel out enough so that my turn actually moved the back end
towards the right.
AND THIS MOVED THE BACK END OUT OF THE WAY OF ONCOMING CAR.

This was COOL.  100% justification of why I own a Porsche.  In a sticky
situation, they come through.
Total control.  I'm still freaking out of not getting killed.

Interesting notes:   Oncoming car was doing about 60mph.  Econobox with
no braking power.  Saw it's nose drop and wheels lock.

This brings me back to the time when I was 20 and my mother was trying
to talk me into getting a sensible car.
During the conversation, when she says parts are too expensive, YOU
DON'T NEED A FAST CAR (another Porsche), we saw another car run a red
light.  We both look at the car coming towards us (40+mph), mom screams,
I floor it.  Do a maneuver around the car in front of us and save my
mothers life.  (the car would have nailed her door)  We get out of the
way, I look at my mother and ask if she is OK.  She says "yes" and I
reply "THAT'S why I like Porsche's.  In your car, we would have been
dead.   She agreed and confirmed that it was a good purchase.  Still
taking time to remind me not to drive fast.  Mothers are great.  So are
Porsches.

I'm done.  Thought you might like to hear a semi-cool story.
