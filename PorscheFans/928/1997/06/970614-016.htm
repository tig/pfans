Source is ANY authorized Porsche dealer.  The complete 9 vol 928 manual
set on fiche has a dealer cost of under $20.00!   

BUT.....

1. The fiche is small and you need a reader that enlarges A LOT!
2. Substantial resolution is lost in the fiche-making.
3. Contrast increases so subtle gradations (as in photos) don't come out
as well on the fiche.
3. Fiche is black & white.  The electrical schematics in the manuals
make substantial use of color-coding ti identify wiring.
4. No hard copy to carry into the car unless you take your fiche to a
library that has the correct enlarging reader that also prints.  Then
you pay $.?? per page.
5. I'm not sure the fiche has all updates inserted as the manual set
does.  I didn't keep mine long enough to check.
6. The parts fiche set (another $20-30) uses a different size reader as
it is larger.  To have total fiche-ness you would need a reader that
could acomodate both formats.

I bought the fiche set and was very proud of my thrifty-ness ... until I
tried out 1-4 above.  Then I went back to the dealer who nicely gave me
full refund on the fiche set against the $286 manual set.  The manual
set comes with ALL updates.  

Regardless of fiche or manual set, you MUST BUY the Porsche
Service/Parts booklet that has exploded parts diagrams for 924-944-928. 
Published by PCNA (not Porsche-Germany) and is around $10.00.  It
includeds exploded assembly diagrams, parts lists, and service hints
for  928s through 1987.  This is a MUST OWN unless you have the most
recent car.
