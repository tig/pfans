 Yes!
 
 I was thinking about this myself.  In addition to the registry, I would like
 to see a listing of as many 928 owner's names and locations as possible.  I
 have a book from the BMW club called "Friends of BMW".  This book has the
 names and addresses and phone numbers of BMW owners / club members all over
 the country (and world if I remember correctly) that are available to assist
 in case of trouble on road trips, etc.  It would also be nice to visit the
 other 928 owners when I am traveling.  Anyway, lets have some comment on
 this.  
 
 Thanks Douglas.  By the way, what info do you need?  I don't use the web
much
 anymore, as I am waiting until I get rid of AOL, and start using my other
 account.

On my 928 page I have added a guestbook.
http://members.aol.com/Alive019/928s4.html

It could be a guestbook for all the 928 pages as we all link all the
different pages together.  When you sign it you could leave your information
on there and tell about your 928.
