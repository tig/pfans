Hello all,
Was driving home yesterday (84 928S) when the central warning lights began
flashing, the only light which remained lit continously was the voltmeter, so
I figured the alternator was ready to die.  I disconnected the battery
terminal w/ engine running, and the car died instantly.  If I keep the RPM's
above 2500 the lights stop flashing.  Is there another way to test the
alternator? The best pricing I've found is $180 for a rebuild from
Automotion.
The car has 42K on it, and I figure it is time to replace the timing belt,
(along w/ the other belts)  The question I have is are there other parts
(rollers, bearings, tensioner) which should be replaced when putting in a new
timing belt?  How many hours are involved w/ the replacement of the timing
belt?  I previously had an 85 944 (grey market car), which lost a water
-pump, so I had the timing belt replaced then as well.  I believe the manual
called for 7-8 hours on the labor for the 944.
Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
TIA, 
-John
