I used to like Jay Leno until after I read an article in Car & Driver (I can't 
remember which ish, it was a few years back tho) in which he described his 
love for cars and his car collection etc. They were discussing which cars he 
liked and disliked when the topic of a recent test drive came up. He talked 
about driving a 928, he described it as like being inside a "womb", he felt 
very disconected from the car, it felt to big, didn't give enough feedback, 
and described the styling to be like a "cocoon" and then went on to say he 
would much rather drive a Ferrari any day. Actually I still like Jay, but he 
can keep what he thinks about the 928 to himself!

Later, Jason Boettcher
