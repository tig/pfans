Turns out I'm loosing freon-no big deal or so I thought.  Had the system leak
checked with a "sniffer" and lo and behold, it's not leaking from a rubber
hose, or the compressor, but rather from that mother of an aluminum tube
which runs from the  front of the engine compartment all the way along the
passanger side and on into the firewall and evaporator!  I don't even want to
think what is involved labor wise to remove and replace that tube let alone
purchase a new one.  Two questions:

1.  Has anyone else had a problem with this aluminum tube or heard of this
problem?

2.  If so, is the only fix complete replacement of the tube and what is
involved, or is anyone aware of a method of local repair to the leak site?

As always, any insight would be appreciated.
