Ron!  (I hope I got the right name with the right person)

Thanks so much for making the trip down this a ways!  I don't know what
happened to Paul from Flowmaster and his 928, but I was definately
impressed with the wide array of 928's (10 in our mini concours, plus
more out on the street) - stockers, winged, wide-bodied!   Susan said
not even Porsche dealers had that many 928's at any one time.

Also, at least we did have a 3-car mini parade in an impromptu sorta way
on the freeway ride back.  Your car sounds so beefy with that custom
exhaust!  Especially with the revs up on the road!  I saw many other
drivers do double takes as you passed them.

Lets all say good luck to Edmund, whose widebody unfortunately might be
totalled from an accident just days ago.  He was so looking forward to
this event and worked so hard on his car!  I knew he was hurting when
Richard pulled in with his wild purple Strosek 928.  Hope this cloud has
a silver lining for Edmund...

Ok, the next official brew night is July 18th (right Philip E.?) and the
super dooper 928 BBQ blowout party will be at DEVEK's Aug. 2nd!  We
should see/hear/ride with at least a handful of 6-liter cars and
widebodies, plus all our factory originals.  I know some of us were
itching to light up the tires at Parts Heaven but restrained.  This
might not be the same when we gather at the shark's nest in Belmont!
Ok, I can almost guarantee it   ;)

I encourage all who can to please join us in Belmont -  this is the
928's 20th Anniversary!!!  Bring a bottle of bubbly or other fav.
beverage and we'll toast at high noon and sample some DEVEK BBQ.  If
it's anything like Marc's 6-liter engines they'll be smoking hot!

About 1 or 2pm or so, we can mount 'em up and move 'em out and either
parade down lovely El Camino Real or practice off-ramp chirpies or leave
(more) rubber by Oracle or any combination!   Jim, you know the area
better, would you like to establish a route that maybe mixes it up and
then brings us back to the DEVEK shop?  I can almost hear 30-40 928's
starting and rumbling away!

Sorry, didn't mean to start rambling.  Today was too short and I look
forward to getting together again...

Phil
