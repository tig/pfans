Bruce,
Take a very, very, very  close look (with a light) at your coolant overflow 
tank. They are notorious for getting very small pressure cracks, this 
condition has stumped many excellent mechanics for years. Look for a sign 
of coolant stains behind and below this unit (on passenger side at hood 
hinge). What happens is the plastic gets old and develops small cracks and 
as it cools down (remember heat expands sealing the cracks and cold 
contracts opening the cracks) during the night (those nocturnal gremlins) 
the cracks open up and will let out small amounts of coolant. It is hard to 
spot, but I would almost bet my 89 S4 (almost) that this is the culprit. I 
have seen it on every 928 I have owned (6). It drove me totally nuts for a 
while wondering where the coolant was going i.e. waterpump, Head Gasket (oh 
no!). BEWARE do not be tempted to buy a used one get it new from Porsche 
for about $150. BTW $1200 for a water pump installed? Come see me in 
Atlanta IF you ever need one, we'll do it together for under $400, and it 
will be done RIGHT.
