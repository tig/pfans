I receive Autoweek and I cannot see any add for Blue light.  Do they
have
a special name or you just call on of those bright bulb company and
ask them for blue light?? 

Has anyone ever fitted yellow light on their
car??  I remember the movie "Private Benjamin" where he european "almost
husband" was driving a 911 with yellow lenses.  It look pretty cool and
it should be easier on the eyes then white.  This would definitly be
a european option.

Maybe I should ask for red light to match my car...
