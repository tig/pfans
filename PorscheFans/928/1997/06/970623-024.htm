Nicely put.    Save this response and send it out every time this subject 
comes up.   Good reminder to everybody, including the 944 list.

>Tom,
>Why do you think Porsche had a outside source mfg. a tool that sells for
>$600? Because it's the "lifeline" between your valves and piston crowns if
>you belt slips a cog. I had a "veteran" 928 mechanic (my 1st. Porsche) who
>said "I can just FEEL when it's exactly right" (Same thing I said on dates
>when I was 18 years old :-) )
>HOWEVER, this does not apply to our cars. CASE IN POINT. I was driving my
>"exactly right by feel" 928 when under stoplight stomping acceleration the
>cam light on the dash came on!. Brought it to veteran, he said, "no big
>deal", just slightly more tension. This time went for 4 days, stomped on
gas,
>light came on again. Called Porsche Dealer Service, explained what had
>transpired over weeks, he said "STOP the engine. Do NOT drive car. WE will
>send a flatbed to pick it up. When I went to the Porsche Dealer to pick up
my
>car (new timing belt/tensioner bearing installed) the Service Manager walked
>me over to another 928 on the rack and said "this is what happens when you
>don't have the $600 tool". The owner of this other car had a $4K bill for
his
>"lucky" experienc of only having collision of 2 cylinders with valves when
>his cam belt slipped a tooth. I then totally  understand. It's kinda like
>saying "why not got to the racetrack with your 928 and have a kid tighten
>your lugnuts with touquing to spec". Pretty assinine. No ill towards you
:-),
>just making a point.
> These engines are $25-$35 grand, why screw with a $700 cam belt replacement
>at anyplace other than the dealer?/ It's also THEIR ass, as they have to
give
>you a 2year P & L warranty on any repairs/parts they replace. This is cheap
>insurance for a job well done.
