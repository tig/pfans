You're concerned about fitting into a 928. Since I'm five inches taller and
15 pounds heavier than you and am frequently and protractedly found in my
S4, suffering no contortions, let me sound an optimistic note.

At least many, if not all, 928s have multiple sets of mounting holes for
the seat rails. These permit you to set the seat's overall height and
longitudinal position, around which the electric motors will adjust things.
If you use the rearmost/lowest of these sets, you can get the rear end of
the seat bottom very close to the floor (enough so that you'll need to
remove the cute little rear floor mat to get the whole range).

Since I'm very long from the waist up, I do this, then run the front of the
seat bottom all the way up (to get thigh support), and then recline the
backrest until my head doesn't hit the roof. I then run the whole seat
forward until I can comfortably grab the steering wheel. At this point, the
keys graze my right knee, but I'm in, comfortable, and happy.

If you're long of leg, your situation will be much easier, because the
combination of electric and mounting hole adjustments can put the seat a
long way back. Either way, you'll be exploring one of the hidden benefits
of what Porsche calls the "emergency" seats in the rear, namely that their
space can be invaded by the front seats, providing room not available in
cars with a rigid bulkhead behind the front seats.
