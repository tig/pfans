I just called them. It's correct they are on sale. Both automatic and 5
speeds available. Price range form DM 80.000 to DM 100.000. "Mileage" is
between 20k and 25k km. One can visit the Gebrauchwagenzentrum in
Zuffenhausen monday to friday 9:00 - 18:00. No appointment needed. 

Anybody in China or South Africa wants me to drive one over to his
place? (after forwarding a few D-marken to the Schwarzwald of course)
