        I suspaect that one of your fuel pumps is reaching the end of it's
life, probably the one inside the passengers side fender whell.  Although it
also sounds some what symtomatic of some type of partial blockage of the
line due to debris.  It gets dragged into the pipe by the fuel flow and then
partialy plugs then line untill feul flow ceases.  I've never had the third
fuel pump (the second main) fail on me so I don't know for shure if the
symtoms you described could be a result of that.  The failiure causes the
fuel pressure to drop about 2/3 to 1/2 of it's normal pressure.  The motor
brushes may just have enough left on them to make the conection most the
time right now.  Although you might be able to hear it running when the car
is, in which case when you have the power loss again check the pump.
Although, when was the last time that the first main fuel filter was changed?
