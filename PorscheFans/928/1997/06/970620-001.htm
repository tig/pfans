While we're at it, I hope you don't mind if I throw a plug in for
Flowmaster - why you might ask since I'm not really a fan of how they
sound?  Mainly because of their involvement with the 928 aftermarket
development.  For example, this goes way back before there was even a DEVEK
- when it was just Bob DeVore himself as featured in the Excellence
'Arizona Highwayman' issue (1990 - I just got a copy of that issue and
fans, if you're planning on doing any 928 mod's you owe it to yourself to
read this first, if only to have a historical reference)...  Bob's 6.2 928
used a dual Flowmaster setup to go 0-175-0 in 30 seconds!

Don't forget about Borla either - their stainless setup is very trick also
and I'll have a hell of time deciding which to go for myself (next year
when I have some money to spend!?!)

And give DEVEK a call.  Just like their ad says, technical questions are
always welcome.  Remember the quote in 'Winning' - these performance shops
have gone down the road already...

Good luck and have fun!
Phil
ps.  Oh yeah, Marc's S4 runs Flowmasters and with headers, was the best
sounding car at WFO at dyno day IMO...
