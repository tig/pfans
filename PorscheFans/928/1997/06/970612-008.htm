There continues to be a lot of discussion on this list about the care and
feeding of the long belt which drives the cams in the 928 engine, which
leads to dissemination of a lot of (at least somewhat) contradictory
statements.

Here is a summary of information from Kim Crumb, the PCA's 928 tech guru,
on the belt and related matters. The source for this are two notes in "Tech
Q&A" in PCA's Panorama magazine for December 1996.

1. The only engines which can turn over with a broken or slipped belt and
not experience valve-to-piston contact are the 1978-79 engines with 8.2:1
compression ratio. All other 16-valve engines, and all 32-valve engines,
will experience damage.

2. The belt's tooth profile was changed in 1983. The new belt (called "HTD"
for high torque design) requires changing the sprockets on the camshaft,
oil pump, and crankshaft.

3. The belt should be retensioned every 15,000 miles.

4. The belt should be replaced at either the 45,000 or 60,000 mile checkup,
and at similar intervals thereafter.

5. A new belt must be retensioned after the first 500-1000 miles.

6. The belt rarely breaks. Rather, it stretches, eventually to the point
where it jumps one more teeth on a cam pulley. This may then damage some of
the teeth, promoting further slippage. The cams are still being driven, but
out of sync with the pistons, hence contact.

7. In the event of such a catastrophe, in addition to replacing the bent
valves, it is best to replace the hydraulic valve lifters. On 32-valve
engines, the chains and chain tensioners responsible for driving the pairs
of cams should also be replaced.
