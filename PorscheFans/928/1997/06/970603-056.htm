Hey P-Fans,

	Not sure how many of you were members of Porschephiles, but as I remember
the was a file located at the web site that was a list of people state to
state (Porsche owners) who were more than willing to help stranded P-nuts. 
Believe it was called the "crap list".   Lots of people carried as an
emergency handbook....  Thinks it's a great idea.
