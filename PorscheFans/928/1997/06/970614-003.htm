Hi!

I will delurk long enough again to ask perhaps a stupid question. 

My '83 928S came with H4's on it. They seem to put out *very* little light
on low-beam, 
but the high beam output is fine. Any ideas? I have since found out that
the previous owner
must have put the H4's on it, as a friend of mine has the same year model,
and his has
a chrome trim ring around the lights, and his lights are the sealed beam
halogens.

What do you guys do about the little gap around the light housing and the
glass
when you use the H4's? Is this something to be concerned about? Cosmetically,
it does not look wonderful, but the bigger lights sure do look better than
the smaller
sealed beam units.

Thanks!
Larry Flaxman
