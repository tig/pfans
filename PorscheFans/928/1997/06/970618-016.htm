A posting member bought my creampuff 90' 928S4 and brought it "home" to
Washington, now I am selling another vehicle, as my wife has her eyes on a
convertible . Vehicle for sale:
1996 Mercedes-Benz S320 SWB Sedan. White exterior/gray leather interior.
Virtually everthing except kitchen sink comes standard on this car, except,
and this car has them: power moonroof & CD player. Vehicle is absolute
showroom condition. Not a nick, scratch, mar inside or out. 23K miles. Under
factory warranty for 2 1/2 more years. Mobil 1 every 3.5K miles. Serviced
with all the book and records. As new. Purchased new @ $65K + luxury tax +
tax + license. Fees paid. California car. A wonderful purchase at only $53K.
No luxury tax to next owner :-). If you ever dreamed of a "S Class", but
thought you couldn't afford it, her'es "as new" for a wonderful price.
Suggest you drive one at MB dealer.
