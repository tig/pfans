Hi Philip!

Microbrew night is pretty irregular - pretty much we all slave at our jobs
then someone fires off the first email "hey what about this friday?" etc. 
We were shooting for at least once a month but it's more like once a
quarter lately...although it is summer finally and the weather is much
better now.

I don't usually have Saturday's free unfortunately, at least not free
enough that I could be away from the city but someday I would like to make
breakfast, er, have breakfast with you all!

See ya' at Parts Heaven!
Phil
