Matt:

I see you've been using my photos and webpages.  You should have at
least asked first - I spend hours and hours and my own cash to produce
928s4vr.com every month  and it is disheartening for you use my images
etc. without even the slightest mention, though lots of other sites are
mentioned.

In fact, my webpage makes up the majority of your site!  Codes, photos,
Dyno day, street shots etc. etc.and this is not okay with me!

How about just putting one link on your page instead, then visitors can
see my info as I intended it, and your info on your site (when you get
around to adding it) as you see fit?  That was the original intention
for the 928 pages i.e.. one site handled the FAQ, another model info,
etc.  a joint, collaborative effort.

What interests you?  How about volunteering for that segment and doing
your website around it?  i.e.. Race info website or  928 sound systems
specific site or ???  Your guest book  is a great idea.  You could
develop it further and that could be your site's specialty.  For
example, I've had other people request if they could post pix of their
other vehicles.  This didn't fit in on my site but sounds perfect for
your site.

I'm keeping an open mind on this, please try also!  Your last update was
three days ago, please try to revise again soon, keeping all this in
mind.

TIA
Phil
