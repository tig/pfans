   Greetings everyone,

   I can't believe it.  Someone that not only lives in the same county,
but also has a 1989 GT?
 Incredible.  I suppose yours is red too, right?  Well if you're ever
going to an autocross, rally, or driver's ed give me buzz.  It would be
nice to once in a while get together with at least one other 928 owner
at club events.  I'll e-mail my phone number to you.

   Ok, back to the subject matter.  Another shop you might try is
POWERTECH(201-586-3210) in Rockaway, NJ.  They advertise in the regional
club mag, Porscheforus.  I have been to their shop twice for minor
service, and found them to not only have reasonable rates, but also to
be knowledgeable and friendly.  The owners  Keith Peare and Mike Daino
are both club members and driving instructors.
