Subject: Re: Fuel filter and crud in the gas tank

In a message dated 6/9/97 Griff Miller wrote:  ...because in NJ, all gas
stations as full-service by law...  Good grief, what a racket.

& Brian Robinson responded: The racket is also in Oregon.  But the
differential is only about .10 a gallon.  Not too bad, especially in the winter.

--------------------------------------------------------------

I lived in NJ (official state name = "New Jersey, What's it to You?") 82-90
and, despite the full-service-only law, the state featured some of the
lowest gas prices in the country.  Out here in Arid-Zona -- where one
corporation controls nearly 50% of Tucson's gasoline retailers -- a good
deal on 92 octane lead-free is $1.45... many vendors hover in the
$1.51-$1.57 range.  Ouch!

Tucson's city fathers didn't like our crime statistics, especially when a
large percentage of the "property crimes" were driving away from the pump
without paying.  They came up with a typical Arizona solution, e.g., it is
no longer a criminal act to steal gasoline!  Apparently we DO get the
government we deserve!
