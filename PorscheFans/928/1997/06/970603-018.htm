Paul,

I think if I were you I would try the H4 bulbs.  The place that I bought my
H5's from said that they did also make driving light bulbs in blue too.

I have an '88 S4 and I think all of the 928 from '87 on had H5's not H4's.
 Some of the earlier cars and euro cars have the H4's.

If I were you I would do some price checking in the ads at the center of Auto
Week magazine.  There seemed to be some very reasonable places to buy lights
at listed there.

Sorry this was so late getting out to you...I just received my last 3 days of
PFans today 6/3.
