Hi, folks. I've been lurking for a couple weeks, absorbing the information.

I recently bought an '82 928 (guards red). High miles, but my
sportscar-hobbyist friend and I checked it over and pronounced it sound and
worth the asking price. It is lovely, and lots of fun to drive (I live in
Santa Cruz, CA and work in Silicon Valley; the drive over the mountain is
quite a lot of fun now :-)).

I'm not yet used to the various sounds that car makes, and have a couple of
questions; I thought I'd solicit ideas from the list.

I notice that after a spirited ride there is quite a lot of hissing and
crackling from the forward undercarriage. A quick look over the engine and
under the front reveals no visible fumes, no funny smells, no drips or
other excitement. The central warning system seems happy. There don't seem
to be any pathological symptoms aside from the sounds produced. Is this a
normal sound for the car? I'll be crawling all through doing fluid checks
and whatnot on the weekend; anything special I should look for?

Just yesterday I began to notice a whirring, scraping sound when the clutch
is depressed. My guesses are contact between the starter ring and something
else, or perhaps a worn bearing. The symptom began quite suddenly.

One other funny sound is a barely audible metallic, nasal whine, almost a
honk, that sometimes occurs briefly at low speeds. It sort of sounds like a
resonance effect. Vague, I know, but I'm gambling that it might be
something idiosyncratic that an experienced 928 driver would recognize.

By the way, just after I got the car I encountered the driver of a black
'86 928 who waved and chased me to a stoplight for a friendly chat. I
certainly appreciate the helpful and friendly character of the general
community of 928 drivers.
