Going finshing..

Did you check the tension on the alternator belt?  If it was slipping,
you might not be producing enough power at low RPM but would be
OK at higher RPM...

As for checking the alternator, "just" take it off and bring it
to your local car part store.  Most of them will test the alternator
for free.

I change my belt on my 85 928.  If you have not done it before, it 
will take you more than 7 or 8 hours.  I will try to work on my
procedure and post it before the week end is over.

As for part that you change while doing it:
	water pump and gasket
	thermostat and gasket(s) (I change the inner gasket also becaue
		it was dried out)
	Rebuilt tensioner (rubber boot, adjustment screw, gasket)
	Does your crankase seal leak?  (You will be there already and
		I should have changed mine)

	DO NOT BUY TRW BELT.  This is what I put in my car and I will
be changing it again soon.  It look like it was design as a Universal
teeth.  They are not round or square.  They look like they fit pretty
good but I would rather have round teeth like original belt.

Be very careful when putting back things in place.  USE A TORQUE WRENCH.
It is very easy to strip the AL block in a car with a few years of age.


Well, I will tell you more in the procedure.
