Hi All!

David Roberts commented on fitting aftermarket speakers to 928s.
I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE!

David said "Please don't butcher such a fine automobile with aftermarket
speakers.
They don't fit right, they damage the leather or vinyl, and it WILL DEVALUE
your 
928. Especially for a "purist" who would pay top dollar for your car someday,
if it was all original." David had to "replace my complete leather door
panels (at a cost of over $1000 used) just because PO put different speakers
in the doors."

Now, my 928S had significant interior "tidying up" to be done when I
purchased it. In fact the passenger's (RHD) door trim actually fell off! As
all of the parts were there, this didn't faze me too much but ALL of the
damage was done by a PO fitting different speakers and stereo. I have got
the car back to totally original now but many of my hours went into it to
get it that way.

Leave the f.....g thing alone!
