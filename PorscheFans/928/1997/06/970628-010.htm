Dear Ed,   (emendez@lucent.com)

I saw your message through Porsche fans.  The 850CSi list price in 1994 was
$108,000 plus luxury tax.  A good friend of mine had a whtie over linen with
deviating black carpets.  He is a total fanatic and the car was definetly the
nicest in the country.  He has been trying to sell the car since about
October of last year, he was looking for $83,000.00 but ended up selling the
car to one of Isringhausen's buyers for around $60,000.00, the book value on
the car at the time was $53,175 (loan) $64,500 (retail) and $59,075
(trade-in).  He got killed due to the fact that he paid the $108,000 new.  It
was a beautiful car and was a good deal at $60,000, only had 11,000 miles,
perfect maintaince, waxed and detailed every three months, professionally
hand washed every week, etc., etc.  As to the market for the 850i coupes,
that really is horrible.  That car listed around $78,000 in 1991 and I have
another friend who has a 1991 for sale and will be lucky if he gets the
$27,000 (he's asking $38,000) book value for it althought it is a perfect car
with only 35,000 miles.

The 928's are a whole different story.  The last 1995 GTS that my dealer had
(Braman in Palm Beach, Fla.) listed out at $83,500.00 or thereabouts.  The
dealer would sell me the car for just about $67,000 which was only about
$500.00 over dealer invoice.  They just couldn't move the cars.  I am very
sorry my dad didn't buy the last GTS they had which was a Black over Cashmere
Supple leather with all the options for invoice.

I have a 1982 928S with 47,000 two owner (including myself) docuemented
original miles, which I bought from a friend of mine in April of 1996.  Since
then I have gone completely throught the car and did everything it needed.  I
even did the stupid things that I felt it needed like a complete new leather
interior from Germany, new leather dashboard for $2500.00 (incl. labor)
instead of just installing a vinyl or plastic piece, completely reworked the
a/c system for about $5000, new compressor, condensor, evap, expansion valve,
drier, high-side line, condensor fan switch, new Ansa OE exhaust system, but
now the car is in absoulutely mint condition.  I am looking for a 93-95 GTS
Automatic though so if anyone has or knows of one available, please let me
know.  My car isn't actively for sale but if someone comes along with the
right number, I might part with it.

Just thought I'd let you know my thinking.

P.S. If anyone is looking for an 850CSi, there is one in Miami at a dealer
called Carcorp, this car has many dinan mods though.  Also, my friend who had
the White one's brother has a Boston Green CSi in the same condition that is
also for sale now.  If interested let me know.
