Is there a better filtration technology out there that has not been produced/marketed for high performance automobiles?
Curious about service intervals required for oiled foam filtration.  How bad could the cost be???
Is K&N really an accurate fit in the gauze category?



snip of a snip...
Here's the info I have on air filter performance. Tests were done by
Amsoil using SAE J726C Test Method 5-best --> 1-worst

                               Oiled foam    Paper   Oil bath   Gauze


Large particle efficiency           5          5        5         4

Small particle efficiency           5          4        1         2

Airflow capacity                    5          2        3         5

Dust holding capacity               4          2        5         2

Load up charactaristic              4          1        5         1

Backfire charactaristic             3          2        5         3

Cleanability                        4          1        4         3

As you can see, K&Ns are great for airflow, which is what they were 
designed for. Their original application was on racing engines, where 
airflow is important and ultimate engine life was of little consern. They 
are not as good at filtering as paper or oiled foam types.
