Ron Writes:
 I am sorry to say I had an engine fire while checking my compression. 4 
fire extinguishers and two hoses and 5 minute it was out. Damage was not as 
bad as it could have been. My harness from Bosh ignition electronics is 
toasted. Also wiring around. Main power routing around starter/alternator. 
Reset of engine compartment is OK including rest of engine harness. I had 
my drivers side door open and the gunk I had just use caught under the car. 
The drivers side door was open and it was toasted. Could you please send me 
use harnesses for ignition, and use drivers door panel. Depressed, Ron 
Gross
