I'm new to the list.  I joined today becase after owning 4 Toyota Supra 
Turbos, I am considering an S4.  It seems to be the next logical step 
up.  I found one, but I'm not sure it's a good deal.  Here's a 
description:

87 S4, 5sp, Red/Black, Alpine CD.  

It has been garaged since day one, and is on its 3rd owner at 116k 
miles.  It has never been wrecked and all maintenance was conducted by 
the Porsche dealer or an authorized service center.  The book has been 
stamped and oil was changed at least every 3k.  The owner has all 
maintenance records from the day it was first purchased.  The car looks 
brand new inside and out with the only flaw being a cracked tailight.  
The price is 11,900.  Is that a bit high?  It has Dunlops with about 10k 
on them, however these tires look brand new.  There is no wear visible 
on either tire.  When driving, there seems to be a low pitched hum from 
the rear of the car, which I though might be a wheel bearing or CV 
joint.  Should this worry me?

I need to be able to use this car as a fairly frequent driver, and will 
probably put on about 10k miles/year.  

With Supras, a common and very expensive flaw is that head bolts are 
inadequately torqued from the factory and the cars suffer frequent blown 
head gaskets.  Are there any similar flaws in 928s?  If you were 
considering this car, what would you look for?  The nearest Porsche 
dealer is almost 3 hours away, so I won't be taking it there to have it 
evaluated.  A friend has a lift in his garage, so I can put the car up 
and look under it.  What should I look for?  Are there any frequently 
removed pieces or guards that I should check?  I know that's a lot of 
questions, but I cannot afford a mistake.  Any words of wisdom you can 
provide would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance,

LeeH
