Hi,


I live in Japan and have been looking into buying a 1983 928 Porsche for
last month. By friend bought it at an auction for a friend in Australia, but
the deal fell through at the last minute and so he asked me if I'd like to
buy it.

The price is about $5000 US.  It's pretty rough cosmetically.  It's had a
bad paint job and it's starting to chip and peel.

The leather on the interior is fine, but some of the temperature knobs on
the dash are broken.  All the electornics seem to work fine.

The car started up and idled fine even though it had been sitting for three
months.  It has some kind of leek, not oil, I thought prehaps power steering
fluid and smoked a bit as it burned off the manafold.

The car has 70,000 km on it.

According the auction sheet it hasn't been in an accident.  But a mechanic
friend I took with me to look at it took a rough mesurement from the wheel
well to the outside of the tire on both sides.  He said there was a 4 mm or
so discrepancy, so he figures it may have been re-ended at some point.

I'll cost me about a grand to get it home so the whole package'll cost about
$6000 US.

What do y'all think?

Your comments would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Jake
