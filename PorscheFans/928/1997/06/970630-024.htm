	Matt,
    I realize you may not have known that your using of Phil's info would 
cause his heartache.Phil has copyrights on his page, it is not only rude, but 
against the law to use any of the info without permission. I know phil has 
woked very hard on his page, he is VERY dedicated to the 928 Fans and has done 
a good thing to help EVERYONE out, all at HIS expense! We all have at least 
one thing in common here, and everyone has been very supportive and hepful to 
eachother. Please do not degrade this list, or any of the 928 web pages, as 
there are few enough for all of us Fans. I just wanted you to know that from  
Phil's point of view, you took something of his that was very personal, and 
did not bother to ask. 
    How would you feel?

   Jim, frequent viewer of 928s4vr
