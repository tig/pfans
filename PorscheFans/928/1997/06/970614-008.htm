I just read the posting about the 1st & 2nd. gearset being $2100 at dealer,
but a "DEAL" at $850 at another parts source. And SOME MEMBERS chastised me
for my posting on the "false economy"/"high cost to repair" on 5spd. 928
transmissions!. You guys better read this last posting. $850 "deal" on 2
internal parts?? Hell, I can completeley GUT a automatic if someone has burnt
all the clutches and bands, completely rebuild for $2,500 by any reputable
shop. Mercedes Benz, for their cars, only charges $2,500 for a COMPLETELY
REBUILT/REMANUFACTURED auto with full MB warranty. 
 Add the "devastating" cost of a clutch job every ____ miles, and I'll take
the 1 second less 0-60 speed on a 928S4 with automatic transmission. So take
that you 5spdr's :-)  Just kidding, thought I'd get you guys who wrote me
worked up :-)

BTW, if any of you guys have to do SERIOUS internal parts replacement on a
5spd, let me know what the total $$ cost of parts is at the "DEAL" source :-)
