Hi All!

The Alfa Digest is very keen on spotting Alfas in the movies and I have
noticed one or two similar postings here about 928s.

We have just got an 8 week old German Shepherd pup (what a handfull!) and,
whilst perusing the shelves at the local video store, I saw K9 with John
Belushi and a German Shepherd on the cover. Of course, I got it and, lo and
behold! One hour into the movie is a great shot of the rear of a 928S. I
freeze framed it and saw that it didn't have the two red foglights like my
Euro one does but it did seem to have indicator repeaters at the rear side.
Also the rear wheels were either 8" or 7" with spacers, I couldn't tell but
they sat close to the fenders. I need to get spacers for mine. I would like
8" wide wheels with 45 aspect ratio tyres but I don't know of any going at a
reasonable price near me (Brisbane, Oz). In the same movie there was a rear
shot of a 911 and the baddies drove a beautiful Maserati Quattroporte.

On the 928S scene, I am gradually working through fixing up all of the
little mechanical things and was just about to think of getting serious with
the climate control. However, in an attempt to put this awkward job aside, I
thought that I would renew the underbonnet (hood) insulation as the rubber
is perished and falling off in bits. I got some non genuine stuff, sold by
the metre, for about Aus$20.00 per metre. It is a heat and oil resistant
rubber with an aluminium reflective foil applied and should work well.
Whilst I had the bonnet (hood) up, I thought that I would proudly look at
my, now, perfectly functioning mechanical parts. Its mechanicals don't
intimidate me anymore as I am becoming familiar with them. However, just to
put me in my place, the brake master cylinder has started to leak! This car
is like a woman! Are we sure they aren't Italian? This is what I would
expect of my Alfa Romeo! Oh, well! at least the further I delve and the more
I spend, the better the car is and the more reason to keep it forever. It is
a good thing that I can put my own time into it though! To keep any older
car in top condition requires either buckets of money or an intelligent
owner. That's probably why most subscribers to this, and the Alfa Romeo,
Digest are engineering types. I imagine that the Lotus is similar but I have
heard reports about lengthy discussions regarding  Zymol on the BMW Digest.

Oh well! Time to go.
