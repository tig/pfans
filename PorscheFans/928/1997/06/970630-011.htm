  As the proud owner of a set of _new_ (to me anyway) '91 GT wheels, 
  I'm a bit confused after reading the pertinent messages posted over
  the weekend.
  
  Articles that I have read (Excellence - August '90; various reviews from
  "928 Performace Portfollio") indicate that the US-spec GT came with pressure
  cast wheels that were 7.5x16 front, 9.0x16 rear.  The Euro-only Club
  Sport came with forged rims that were 8.0x16 front, 9.0x16 rear.
  
  To nitpick a bit, the overall "look" of the GT/Club Sport wheels is
  similar when viewed from a distance, but close examination reveals some
  major differences in the design.  The Design 90 wheel actually has a
  ~1/2" rim along the circumference of the wheel.  The _spokes_ on both
  the front and rear are actually inset from this rim and provide something
  of a deep dish effect.  The Club Sport wheels look almost exactly like
  the standard 928 flat dish wheel (standard starting in '83 and continuing
  through the S4 series) except that the seven holes have been elongated.
  Like the flat dish wheel, the CS wheel is forged.  The Design 90 appears
  to be cast.  Wheel Enhancement's web page has good photos of the two,
  but they are shot dead on, so it is hard to see the depth that I'm
  referring to on the Design 90 wheels.

  I know that my wheels are OE 928 wheels.  They have the air pressure
  sensors and even a warning sticker (with a 928.xx... part number) that
  advises on how to properly dismount tires on the rims.  These items
  were standard on the '90-91 US-spec GT.  I saw a set of Club Sport 
  wheels on Kim Crumb's car a few weeks ago.  Curiously, he also referred 
  to them as GT wheels.
  
  So, which model years had which wheels?  When was the switch made to/from
  and 8.0 front width to a 7.5?  Which cars got the forged rims and which
  got the pressure cast?  Is this a case of US-spec vs Euro-spec?
    
  BTW, Phil has a picture of the Design 90 GT wheels on the red car in
  the 928 GT section of his web site.
