This is my guess of the day.  well multiple guess anyway.

1. Is the break shield (back piece of sheetmetal) loose?
2. This is a wild guess.  The inside pad in the front caliper
of my 85 has clips on the inside to hold them on the cylinder.  Did
one of them pry themseleves out and hitting something?
3. What shape is the clip that holds the floating part of the caliper
to the stable part (hey how clear can a guy be??).  The clip is about 
3/4 of an inch whide and is in an angle shape and, well its not getting
clearer...

Good luck,
