  The price split is actually going to fall between the '83-84 and
  '85-86 model years since the former had the 16v engines, while the
  latter got the (more desirable) 32v.  Also note that there may even
  be a price split within the '86 model year as the later versions
  produced had the 4-piston S4 brakes (but this would be dependent on
  the PO "knowing" what they had!).
