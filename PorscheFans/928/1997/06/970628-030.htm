Quite a good one, depending on what caused the light to come on and what
you do next. As soon as you see this warning (to which your attention will
be drawn by the "!" lights), SHUT OFF THE ENGINE (throttle closed, clutch
disengaged, key off). Wait a moment, then try starting.

If the engine starts (a good sign) and the "BELT TEN" light does not come
on (another good sign), it's probable that nothing is harmed and likely
that the belt is fine, too. The sensor which triggers this warning can be
fooled, among other things by very hard driving under some (don't know
what) circumstances.

It can also, if the warning comes on again later or intermittently when
you're not driving particularly hard, indicate correctly that the tension
is just getting out of spec, in which case you should get the belt
retensioned ASAP.

If you restart and the warning comes on and stays on, shut the engine off
and have the car flatbedded to the shop.

If the engine won't start, you're too late.
