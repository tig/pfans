13 volts is not really enough. Each cell gives you 2.2 volts, and since
they are in series should give you 13.2 volts total, theoretically.
And that's just nominal. With the car running, you ought to have
anywhere from 13.5 to 15.0 volts, as measured at the battery.

It sounds to me like you have a problem with your charging system.  Bad
voltage regulator, bad alternator, loose/slipping alternator belt,
etc.  Verify your in-dash voltmeter's reading with a voltmeter hooked
up at the battery; it could be that you are getting a false warning,
but this is unlikely.
