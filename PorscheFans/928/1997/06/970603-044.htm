The 928 plug is magnetized.  Mine came out very clean.  I heard a story =
that Fiat had a chart that the guy doing the oil change would hold the =
plug up to.  The chart showed acceptable and unacceptable amounts of =
metal shavings hanging down from the plug.  I was told the acceptable =
length was alarmingly long.

Terry,

My old Triumph Spitfire also had a magnetic drain plug in the gear box.
Not on
the sump though. It also always had lots of gear box internals stuck to
it! This might cause too much embarrassment for other manufacturers to
copy ...
