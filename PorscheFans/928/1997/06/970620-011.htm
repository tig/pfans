Mark,

  I wrote up the message that added some additional details about the "early" 
  Weltmeister springs (that were progressive in front, linear in the rear).
  
  The information you provided wasn't confusing because it specifically
  talked about Eibach springs.  I think the confusion arose because an 
  Automotion salesperson told me (as I was placing an order for the $99 four 
  spring kit they had on sale) that the Weltmeister springs I was 
  buying _were_ developed by Kim Crumb and were the springs currently listed in 
  their catalog (but that the stock numbers had changed).  I spoke to Kim 
  Crumb in person this past weekend and he said that he had _not_ developed 
  the "early" Weltmeister set (that I inadvertantly bought).
  
  The Eibach name is obviously known and respected, and you have way more
  information than I as to the differences between the old and new Eibach
  sets for our cars.  For me, the manufacturing origin of any Weltmeister 
  equipment is a bit of a mystery.  I tend to think that Weltmeister is
  not necessarily Automotion-specific since the Weltmeister brand is also
  sold by Tweeks and Performance products.  (Unless of course Automotion
  is sourcing these parts to their competitors, which would seem odd.)
