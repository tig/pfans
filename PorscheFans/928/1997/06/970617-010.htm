Yes very, thank you: went to "24 heures du Mans" that was great (I live
in the south of the Netherlands)

Everybody driving their car or watching Montreal or Le Mans?

Had a similar experience last week. Looked at a '87 S4, 5 speed (the
second one I ever got close to). 130.00 km (clocked?), price $17.600.
VIN WPOZZZ92ZHS840266, so '87 checks out. It had a perfect respray
(red), except ugly on the roof, gts mirrors and rear end except fenders,
nice interior, loose wires under passengers floor mat, no antenna (just
a hole in the roof!), no electrics worked due to lack of battery (so no
testdrive), missing control knobs like headlamp adjuster, no service
history, no tool kit, no spare, cracked windscreen, red BBS wheels both
right ones with larges dents, and a stange large dent in the anti sway
bar that is on top of the engine. Further no leakes and no signs of a
crash, but all the little things looked too suspicious to me. So I
walked away.

I have the same feeling!
