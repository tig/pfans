All we have to do is remind/convince PCNA that support for prior models is 
probably the most important selling point for new Porsches. Their new cars 
are worth more than a Toyota or Detroit product because it is expected to 
be supported longer and to be worth supporting longer.

One other thing to argue for a CDROM service manual and "parts fiche" is 
the cheaper Porsche can get the right info in owner's hands the more parts 
they can sell us. Who's going to brave that transmission job with only a 
Chilton's manual?

While I'm not going to put a comuter in the garage so I can consult a CDROM 
service manual (come to think of it, there are 3 out there already), I'd 
happily print the section I'm working on. Write all over it. Handle it with 
dirty paws. And throw it away when finished. Do roughly the same thing for 
the printed manual too, am not going to get that expensive thing dirty.
