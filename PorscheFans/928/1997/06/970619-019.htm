  Well, they're just guides, after all.  Market conditions in different
parts of the country make it difficult to get an "average" retail price
that would be applicable in all areas.

  For example, the June NADA book (Pacific Northwest edition), suggest
that a 1990 model with 13K miles should retail for $28,775.00 -- '89
models are too old for the current book (you could also get the Older
Used Car Guide, which lists from '79 - '89).  Kelley Blue Book is almost
a thousand dollars higher for the same car.

  The bottom line?  There is no "hard and fast" guide.  What do 928's
seem to sell for in your area ?  What do other list-members think ?

  Later,

	-- Andy
