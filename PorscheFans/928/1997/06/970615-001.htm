I finally got these new blue H4s today from a local shop, he doesn't stock
them but ordered them for me. He claims they're illegal and that's why he
doesn't sell them. I hooked them up on my Mercedes (my 928 is still in the
shop, transmission rebuild), and turned the lights on. The road lit up with
an eerie blue glow, and the road signs and paint on the asphalt almost
flouresced (sic). They are definitely not the Xenon ultra-white lights, but
they sure do look cool!

Driving with them on, I suspect they don't offer as good lighting as normal
white lights. Even with high-beams, visibility isn't great. They are normal
wattage lamps, so I think going to a higher wattage makes sense with these
lights (the blue coating must filter out other wavelengths, hence, less
overall lighting, so higher wattage is needed to counteract this).

I wonder if these are the same lights as the "Stargate Superion" lights
from Nopi that many people have purchased on this list. Are those lights
white, or predominately blue (like mine)? Also, can someone give me the
part number again (I might as well order those and check them out).


Last question, does anyone have H4 lamps on their 928? I do, and I thought
that 928s either have the inferior sealed beam tungsten, or the S4-on H5
lamps, anyway, just wondering, so drop me a line.

Waiting for my 928 (in a wash of blue light),

Paul Hatziiliades
