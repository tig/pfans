I got some Ion blues locally from a shop called Boston Auto Design. They
were H4s for by M-Benz and the HB4s for my BMW (55/60 watts). They were
about $15/each.

 After I fired them up, I was rather dissapointed, they didn't put out the
bright white, with bluish tint light that I was looking for and see so
often around town. Instead, they had a weird yellow/gold and just a smidgen
of blue mixed in. Are these just low quality lights that I found, or are
they ion "golds", not the blues I want.

(also, some people I know have spent a few hundred dollars to put these
lights on their cars, as they get some sort of wiring harness, and other
gadgets to get the white/blue light. Are they just being ripped off, or is
this the only way to get the light I want, and the bulb swapping is just a
cheap imitaion trick?)
