The same thing happened to me in a '71 Thunderbird. One of those rubber
freeze plugs popped out while I was standing on the loud pedal. It was
not such an easy fix, since it was the plug behind the starter, and
the starter was sort of tricky to remove. I also made it harder on myself,
since I insisted on replacing it with a REAL plug.  :^D  I'm such
a perfectionist.

BTW, wanna freak out a auto parts counterman? Ask him for a wiper motor
for a '71 Thunderbird.  :^D  They don't have them. The power for the
wipers comes from the power steering system.

#define SOAPBOX TRUE

Of course, these days, auto parts people aren't that hard to confuse.

#define SOAPBOX FALSE
