Hmm, it is obvious that the writers of that article are Purist of
the Porsche brand.  I personaly think that the problem with
Porsche commentator is that they "grew" up with the rear engine
design.  They got used to its problem and saw how Porsche Engineering
solved it, and the just cannot see anything else.

Then came the 924, which was a good design but a mistake by Porsche.
My reason for saying this, it had not enough power.  The purist
only saw the lack of power and they made it equal to the water cooled
front engine design.  The cards were delt, and the cards were bad...

With the 928, the 911 people saw it as the replacement for their car.
They did not like this one bit.  By then, their 911 was sacred.  Porsche
was going through tough times, the yuppies decided they wanted sport
utilities, so they drop the 928, removing the threat of replacing
the 911 (wich is by know really a 993?, but lets not scare the 911
fans).

Now, we get a bit of a revenge with the 911 going watercooled.  The
air world will be upset and, if you have an air cooled 911, you
probably gained some value.

Porsche this time did a bit better in their marketing of the boxter.
They associated the car with one of their classic.  They only moved
the engine slighly forward, the model has decent power and the
convertible "miata look" (actualy, it should be MG look) is in
with the "yuppie" crowd.

One thing that I think Porsche is doing wrong is to use too many
exterior parts for all the cars.  I do not care if they used the same
radiator or water bottle but using the same lights or fenders to save
money on a $50,000 or more does not attract me one bit.  At the price
the car goes for, some of these part should not have to be the same...

Maybe, 10 years down the road, Porsche will try again to bring a front
engine car.  Only time will tell...
