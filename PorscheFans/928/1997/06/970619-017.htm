I have an excellent mechanic who owns a small shop named "AUTO SPORT"
located in North Hollywoood CA.
He is older German guy (Trainedby Porsche in Germany) very detailed
oriented person, very meticullous, treats your porsche like it was his own.
His name is Manfred(he even has the German accent) he also own 2 Porsche
Speedster which he has restored and races.
 He does excellent work at a reasonable cost (1 man shop). i.e. timing belt
 change $250.00. Rebuilt my Auto transmission (replace pump and rebuilt)
$2100.00
.. I did some shopping around for the tranny fix and the lowest quote I got
was $5000.00. This guy is fantastic, he fixes little details on your car
while
doing the major work. Note: he also works on Mecedes Benz's (great for the
928 tranny). He is the best kept secret in Southern California.
With him I know that he and only he is working on  my 928s.
