  My car has done the since I bought it. I took it to the dealer right away, 
  they said the sizzle sound was A/C condensation dripping on something hot and 
  was normal. Here in Houston it can get very humid and it is quite common for 
  cars to have a good sized puddle of water under them after a ride with the AC 
  on. I've lived with the drip-sizzle and have never noticed any problems with 
  the car that I could associate with this. So I believe the dealer in this 
  case.

  Is the A/C on when you hear this?  Never heard this sound on the 928, 
  but my wife's MB makes a noise with similar characteristics when the 
  A/C is on.  I think the compressor clutch is about to bite the dust.
