I have been receiving lots of E-mail regarding the "belly pan". Sorry,
probably not the correct techincal name, my aplologies. I believe perhaps
because many 928's just don't have one (a FEW mechanics "forget" to put them
back on"? :-). It's a combination of two unitsrivited together, one being
metal/aluminum stampings/formings and the other half being reinforced
fibreglass materials. It starts just behind the lower lip spoiler on S4's and
ends behind the engine. It bolts up at various points. It forces air to
certain areas for cooling, diverts and causes smooth airflow at other areas
for wind resistance lessening. In any case, many of you may not have one. My
local Porsche dealer says many SUBSEQUENT 928 owners never knew the car even
had one from the factory!. Just a informative tip. Mine is in excellent
condition and shown in a "for sale" listing in earlier posting.
