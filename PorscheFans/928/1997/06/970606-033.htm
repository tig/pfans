Griff,

I have seen a quite nice 88S4 go for $13500 just a few weeks ago.  I have
seen an '87S4 in an ad in Auto Week for several months now for $14900...just
based on those two sales/ads I would say that a $10k '86 is not out of the
question.  Just keep your eyes open and watch for a good one.  Some of the
best advice I have seen given on the list here is to buy the very nicest and
newest car that you can afford...you will be much happier in the long run.

Good luck on your quest!

'88S4 Dunkelblau/linen leather

PS...If anyone knows of a Euro S (300 hp motor) w/ an auto trans and in need
of some interior work and maybe paint let me know.  I am thinking of a
project for me and my grandfather.  I had a line on one but it turned out to
have a rear main seal leak and the mechanical work is out of my league so I
had to pass.  It went for $2700 which was to much by about $600+ since it
needed a $1300 main seal.
