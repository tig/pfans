by restrictor, you mean the little plate inside the gas filling tube
preventing you to stick the diesel nozzle in??  If that is the
case, it is a stupid regulation now a days.  The restrictor was put
in to prevent people to put leaded gasoline in their car but it
is now impossible to buy leaded fuel.  So what's the point??

I will issue a guess.  If you add a catalyst and run the engine on the
lean
side, you should be OK.  A lot of car do not have air pump so there
should be
a way to pass emission without it.  Also, did the US 79 928 had an air
pump??
looking at what was on the US version of your car is probably the
easiest way to
find out what you need to do.

The hose on my 85 appears to be on its last leg.  Might want to check 
yours...  Also, I have heard of cylinder rebuild kit but not rebushing.
Did they do a patch job or is it just a terminology problem??
