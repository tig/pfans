Vince,
I would not recommend this. According to articles in Porsche Tech Bulletins 
concerning Dual Disk Clutches, the majority of problems with the Dual Disk 
Clutch is from the fact of most mechanic's inexperience on how to properly 
align the disks upon installation. There are some very detailed 
explanations concerning this in the later versions of the Factory Workshop 
Manuals. Plus according to Porsche and most 928 specialists the Dual Clutch 
Setup is stronger and because of the smaller disk size, creates less 
damaging vibrations and inertial strain on your drive-train. That is of 
course when it is properly installed.!!
P.S. Like the later Single Disk Clutch, the Double Disk Clutch has had many 
upgrades and if you are not careful you can get a "mixture" of  upgraded 
parts. Do your research and DOUBLE-CHECK the Part Numbers and Fit before 
installation.
