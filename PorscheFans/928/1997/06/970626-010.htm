My 84 928S is in great shape and since buying it, I've done all of the
preventive maintenance and been proactive with "known" problems like ball
joints, c/v joints, timing belt, etc. The only gremlin which we can not seem 


to nail down is an A/C leak. I've had the car to several different shops and 


each thinks they have found the leak and claim to have fixed it. After eight 


trips, four "specialists" (two local Porsche technicians and two A/C shops), 


14 lbs of freon and $1,500, it still leaks.

Symptons: Freon will last about a week with limited use of the A/C. Using
the A/C normally, about 3-4 days max. First day, extremely cold, second,
maybe a little warmer, third, noticeably warmer and fourth, the compessor
will not cycle. If I drive the car any distance over about a hundred miles,
the A/C will be cold when I park, but overnight it is gone. I've noticed
that after a couple of longer drives using the A/C, condensation is so heavy 


that it will run down my driveway.

So far, I've had several try to "sniff" the leak and two mechanics use
flourescent dye to find the leak. We've gotten two new expanison valves with 


o-rings, a new reciever dryer, seal kit in the compressor, new hoses
(twice). I would think that a leak of this magnitude would show up on the
sniffer or with the dye, but evidently, it is more complex.

Does anyone else have an experience with this? My next step is the
evaporator core which promises to be over a $1,000 repair. I would like some 


advice before I try this as Im not looking forward to spending this much and 


then getting home, only to find I've still got a leak somewhere else.

Thanks
