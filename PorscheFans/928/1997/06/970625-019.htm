I will have to disagree with this statement.  The BMW 850CSi and a few other
choice automobiles (928 included I'm sorry to say) have horrible resale
value.  They were designed for a style of driving that doesn't often occur in
the US.  The 850 BMW was near $140,000 new, and now they can be bought with
very low miles for the high $30's and $40's.  Don't get me wrong, they are
excellent cars, but the electrical problems that BMW has had with their big
sedans (750 is a great example) hurt their resale value.  Jaguars, Audis, 928
Porsches, and 7 & 8 series BMW's are all great used car buys (as long as you
can afford repair bills).
Maybe the new 500hp sedan BMW is building to replace the 8 series will take
off a little better.

P.S. I would say a successful dope dealer is one who isn't in jail yet.
