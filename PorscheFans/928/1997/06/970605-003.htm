Well, that's good. I wasn't too worried. I just feel like I'd better
drive one before engaging in an all-out search for The Right 928.
Of course, I would be sure to drive any car before actually buying
it, but I want to drive one before spending a lot of money and
time amassing a list of candidates. If I decide that the 928 is
not for (doubtful) I will have saved myself and others a lot of
time.
