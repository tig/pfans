Okay, thanks. That helps.

It looks like the 928 I *want* is the '86 928S. OTOH, the 928 I can
*afford* is probably going to be an '84 or '85 model, since my
budget is about $10,000. Someone told me earlier this morning that
there is a really nice '86 for sale for $13,000, but I doubt they'll
want to drop down to 10-something just for me.  :^D

I realize the '86 doesn't have the phone-dial wheels - that's okay.
I like those, but I'd rather have the more powerful engine of a later
model than those particular wheels.
