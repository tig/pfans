I looked at the car on Sunday. It is fairly clean, and (PHIL) IT'S A BLACK 
FIVE SPEED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A photocopy of the original invoice is in 
the window.It does have an elaborate stereo set-up, but it is a Clarion 
system. The wheels are 17" Forgeline (I think) turbo cup replicas ( five spoke 
with rivets all the way around), although I didn't look to see if they were 
polished or chromed. They were not as wide as I thought they would be, 255's 
in the rear, I think. The car belonged to an ex-49'er, I can't remember the 
name though. The rear cargo area was raised, with a false floor, about 6" to 
mount the subwoffer, and amps. The car does have the rear cargo cover, and it 
is only worth about $90.00, not $900.00! The seats are in great shape, the 
interior is immaculte, the body is good, except the passenger side door was 
trying to tell me something, an accident maybe? The engine was clean, but 
there was sand? on the radiator "sill" right underneath the intakes. I guess 
it could have been road junk that had collected there, or from an engine 
washing. The underside was in good condition, though the normal bottoming out 
was obvious. The front of the tranny was wet with oil, so I would tend to 
believe that the seal at the yoke was wearing. Another thing that I thought 
was funny was the clock was the old round analog type. I thought that was 
discontinued in '86? (Anyone?!) If I were buying it I would take it somewhere, 
the dealer stuck me as wanna-be mobster types, but not as sleazey as most used 
car salesman. They had a 924S for $7,900. Now that made me laugh! I see nice 
944's for less than that.

Well anyway, if any of you are really interested, and need someone to look at 
something in particular, I only work about 2 miles away from the dealer.

Later,
