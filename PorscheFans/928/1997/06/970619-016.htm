I asked Mark Anderson of 928 International the following question:

Would you be willing to comment to the list on old Eibach v. new Eibach v.
whatever spring sets? Kim Crumb is now a fan of the "new" springs, and many
of us are just trying to sort out the alternatives.

Mark replied as followed, and asked me to forward this to the list:

Because I have never driven on the two springs back to back it's hard for me
to comment much.  The original springs were developed by Kim and Eibach and
were raved about by many.  When Automotion started sponsoring Kim's car he
came up with a new spring exclusively for them.  I'm sure that the new
spring is very nice as well,  a few of my customers have them and are happy.
Hope that helps.

That's the word from Mark!
