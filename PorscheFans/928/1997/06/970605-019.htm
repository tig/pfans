Cars that is... Viewed on the Discovery Channel,  "FAST CARS, the power and
the passion" .  Modern documentary on Callaway TT Vette, Porsche 911 TT and
Ferrari F50.  GREAT SHOW!  Lots of in-car footage showing different steering
hand 
techniques, blazing road racing, interviews, etc.  (un-helmeted driver a bad
example but fairly real world).  Hopefully they'll air it again...  PT

The truly amazing thing about this show, narrated by true believer Jay Leno,
is the depth of the technical descriptions.  Most TV shows about cars and
racing make the assumption that Joe Public will run screaming from anything
technical beyond a third grader's comprehension level.  This show dived into
the deep end, talking tires, slip angles, weight transfer, etc. at a level
capable of keeping a moderately knowledgeable enthusiast awake.  Though Leno
was not given any writing credit for the show, I assume that the price of
his involvement included letting him get down to  the REAL stuff that makes
these cars interesting (vs. the gold chain crowds' cars=image=sex equation).
The show seems to be showing up regularly in odd-hour time slots...
definitely worth finding & taping!
