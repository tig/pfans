On another note, you seem to have an excellent understanding of all things
928 related - here's a question for you:

My 78 Euro runs great, and starts great - except when warm. Cold engine
fires to life immediately, warm engine starts easily only if its been off
for a couple of minutes, otherwise its *very* difficult to start. In fact
the only way to start it in that condition is if I hold the accelerator to
the floor as if it's flooded - which it may well be. I saw a tech tip once
about this which suggested changing the fuel accumulator, but it didn't
explain why. Any ideas? Do you know where the accumulator is located?

Bob,
 In Vol. "VII" of "UP-FIXIN der PORSCHE"  from PCA they discuss warm start 
problem with early "CIS" fuel injection systems. The culprit seems to be a 
tiny Check Valve in your Fuel Pump, it sticks and causes your problem, it 
is very common. There are 2 solutions: #1 replace fuel pump with new pump 
that was updated in 1981, all new pumps that you get for your car will be 
of this version(this updated  pump has a external screw in check valve, 
instead of a built in check valve). #2 You can buy the external check valve 
assembly and screw it into your existing pump(I think because of your car's 
age I would get the new pump). the check valve part # is 810.906.093 plus 
cap nut part # N011 0691. There is a possibility someone could have already 
installed a later version of the pump. Take a look at it, if it has just a 
long smooth nipple with just a hose clamped on it (between the electrical 
connectors)  that is the old style, if it has a threaded nipple with a 
compression nut,  that is the new style (the threaded nipple contains the 
check valve, above part #) and you could just replace the nipple/check 
valve. If you get the new pump make sure you get a new check valve, they 
are separate parts. If you need help locating the pump or others questions 
let me know .

P.S.: PORSCHE says keep using the Chevron Techron additive and gas, your 
Fuel Injection System will Love you for it!
