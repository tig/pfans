It is my understanding that the best way to adjust a Porsche suspention
is by weight distribution.  This mean a very well equiped shop that has
a scale for each wheels and the the personel to do a proper job.  I
am not sure if it is a good idea just to change the height and
eyeballing
the results.  But then again, its just me and a proper balance job would
cost ~$150...

No idea, so I won't try to midlead you on this one...
