>Greetings,

>Im experiencing a problem with my 87 S4 after a heavy rain and sometime
>after a good car wash.  My guess is that humidity or steam builds up in some
>humidity sensitive area and causes it to lose its ability to idle smoothly.
>When it occurs, the car's idle will surge between 1200 and 0 (indicated on
>the tach) and sometimes stall out completely.  Its recovery time varys but
>eventually clears up.  While in the surging idle, strong fumes come from the
>pipe (unburned fuel).  My guess is ignition, could it be a fuel problem or
>anything else that could screw up the idle mixture when wet?

>If anybody has had similar experiences, please post.  It's rain season here
>in Florida.
