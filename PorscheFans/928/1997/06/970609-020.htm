The fuel filter is back near the gas tank, under a cover.

Uh-oh. You shouldn't be hearing pressure release when you unscrew the
cap. I imagine that it's actually vacuum, and that's what is causing
your car to run badly until you take the cap off to fill it up. There
should be various hoses and a charcoal cannister (in the right front
fender) to deal with evaporative emissions while still venting the
fuel tank.
