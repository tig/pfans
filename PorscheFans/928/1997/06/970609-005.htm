Dear 928 Fans,
	Yesterday I noticed that the metal insert (with the spring-load flap)
inside the fuel filler nozzle was severely corroded.  (I never had taken
off the gas cap before, because in NJ, all gas stations as full-service by
law, so I never had the need...)  Clearly, bits of rusty crud had been
falling in the tank for years.  As carefully as I could, I plucked this
piece out and swabbed out the residue.  My concern is will the fuel filter
trap this stuff, or will some of it pass and plug the injectors (and
explain my subpar performance)?  Where is the fuel filter, anyway?  Is it
worth removing the tank and cleaning it out?
	I also suspect that water is getting into the tank somehow.  Whenever it
rains, and afterwards, every once and a while the car sputters, loses
power, stalls, recovers, until I fill up again.  The filler cap seems to
seal well (I hear the pressure release when I take the cap off), so I can't
imagine how its getting in (condensation? or maybe something else
entirely).  I noticed that the rubber seal (now badly deteriorated) that
goes between the filler and the body has an overflow hole in the bottom of
it, but no hose was attached to it.  Is this thing supposed to send
spillage back into the tank somehow?  If so, where does the missing hose
go?  To that canister thing in the passenger fender?  With emissions
standards as they are, I doubt this thing was intended to send spillage
onto the ground.


Thanks,
