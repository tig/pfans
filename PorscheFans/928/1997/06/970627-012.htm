<<The 850 BMW was near $140,000 new, and now they can be bought with
very low miles for the high $30's and $40's>>

Actually the 850CSi sold for just over $ 100K and I have yet to see a
used one for under $ 70K.  They imported something like 100 units and
are extremely rare.  The regular 850Ci's are finally hitting the mid to
high 30's, but these are 1991 models with mileage in the 50K plus range.
 If anything, for some bizarre reason the 8 series cars hold their value
better than the 7 series despite the fact that the 7 series sold far
better new than the 8.

My father has a 1990 750iL that has yet to ask for anything other than
regular maintenance, so he's been lucky as far as electrical, or any
other kind of bugs go.  The problem is that despite that it is a low
mileage car (29,000 miles) and in impeccable condition, he would be
lucky to get anything over $ 20K for it.

As for the 928's having bad resale value, all I can say is "Great!!"  I
have wanted a 928 since the first time I saw one as a kid circa 1979 or
1980.  I got the 968 because after owning a 944 for several years I
became hooked.  I love the fact that the snobs out there believe that
the only true Porsche has to be air cooled, leaving the magnificent
water cooled Porsches for the rest of us.  I have only driven a couple
of 928's (My brother in law's early '78 model back in 1984 or 1985, a
new '86 back in 1986 and a beautiful '89 a year or two ago, all 5 speed)
and am still convinced that there is no better Grand Touring car.
Period.
