Stephane,

Please note that the procedure I used in this application has some "slight" 
deviations from the "Factory Workshop Manual" engine removal description.

Please also note that before we started with engine removal we had already 
removed front suspension and most of the wiring harness in the front 
portion of the GT.

Step 1: Take a large reciprocating metal-cutting saw with 12" blade (you 
can use a cutting torch here but we didn't want to damage any engine 
rubber, hoses, wiring etc.) and cut front of car off just behind the custom 
"V" shaped radiator along the (wrinkled) fenders.

Step 2: Remove all wiring harnesses in the engine compartment along with 
coils, power steering hoses, oil cooler hoses, etc.

Step 3: Place 8 large 4' (6"x6") wooden posts under engine and torque tube 
for support.

Step 4: Attach Warn 8000lb winch cable to front of fender on right side 
(what's left of it). Pull firmly and gently until right fender is about 3 
feet outside of normal "Factory" position.

Step 5: Same as above except on left fender (what's left of it)

Step 6: Unbolt Torque Tube and associated hardware.

Step 7: Walk inside engine compartment (with 3 other people) and gently 
lift and remove engine.

Step 8: Place engine on cardboard and foam rubber in back of CJ-7

Step 9: Drive around town and have everyone yell at you at the stoplights.


That's all there is to it.

Seriously Stephane, I have removed engines form 3 other "normal" 928s and 
all you have to do is follow the step by step instructions in the Factory 
Workshop Manual, there are no hidden tricks. It is not as bad as you 
imagine (the doubt and dread are much worse) it to be. In fact I pulled the 
engine out of my 89 just because my Oil Pan was leaking. It was worth it! 
(to me anyway)
