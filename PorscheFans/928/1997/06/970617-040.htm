Hi all:

The GT arrived last thursday, washed it off and dried it on the freeway!
First Mustang falls prey on short blast.  Spoiler was torn off when they
unloaded it, otherwise what a car!  Cockpit is unfamiliar and I look like a
tourist activating the wipers, hi-beams and computer by accident.  Off to
Madison's house to show him the new toy, tire(?) shake detected 80mph+. 
Just like he says, every car on the highway wants to race/tailgate me.  I
keep cool.  

Day two:  Who said the GT is stiff?  Feels a little soft, maybe shocks and
springs are worn (80k and 7 years old).  Corners flat though!  Mad and I
stop by Jim's place in San Jose CA.  Jim's car is more shark like now after
installing the coilover setup from you know who.  Oh yeah, earlier I got
pulled over by four motorcycle cops at the same time for no front plate -
maybe they thought I was going to run?  (you go that way, you - that way,
us this way!) 

Day three:  BBQ at James Z's...  The street in front of the house looks
like a German car dealership - 928's, 911, M3 & a 300 SL.  I am getting
very accustomed to the shift pattern now, especially 1st gear...

Day four:  Drop off at DEVEK for follow-up.  Getting new D40's (on sale!),
alignment and on-car balance.  Wheel slightly off from new rack install. 
GTS clutch is spot on, I didn't know it had it!  Marc tests the car and I
have a total blast!  All systems go except for tire pressure system as
these wheels do not support the sensors.  Car ready Wed. I hope with the
new tires, etc.  

Night four:  Saw the old car in the showroom window.  It's "...grinning at
me to take it out for old times sake..." saying in that husky shark voice,
"cmon lets get us a midnight snack!"

928's are really in my blood now and I hear the engine roaring away in my
mind...

Phil
