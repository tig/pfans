A quick note about the O2 sensor...it almost caused a fire in the fuse
> panel of my car when the +12v wire leading to the sensor chafed against
the
> exhaust heat sheild and shorted.  According to the schematic in the shop
> manual, that circuit is not fused.  When I replaced the wiring, I put a
fuse in series with
> it.  If the protective tubing leading from the sensor is intact (mine
> wasn't), you shouldn't have this problem, but it wouldn't hurt to look
> under there and make sure everything looks ok.

> Seems like they could have fused the O2 sensor ckt and put a warning lamp

Ed, 2 small things:
1. What rating fuse did you use and how did you get to that value?
2. Would it be possible to put a title to your message in the future?
It
might make searching the archive a little bit easier (and will enable
some
of the "grumpier" list member tl skip over what they don't like and not
be grumpy...)
Well, make it 3 things:
What were the symptoms of the idle control valve defect?  I also have an
85 and
would like to know what to look for in the future,
Stephane,

I used a 5 amp fuse.  The DC impedance of the O2 sensor ckt (circuit)
measured about 2.5 ohms cold.  I figured the impedance probably would
increase significantly as the sensor heated, decreasing current draw.
Sensors generally are not big users of power.  So far, after 2 years, the 5
amp fuse is still intact.  I'm sure the short-ckt current was far greater
than 5 amps considering how quickly it melted the wires.  One interesting
thing...I drove the car for weeks w/o the O2 sensor and did not notice any
change in engine behavior or fuel mileage.

I replaced the idle valve because I was having trouble with the engine
stalling whenever I took my foot off the gas and my old mechanic said the
valve was probably at fault.  The engine would drop below the normal idle
point and sometimes catch itself, most times not.  I've seen some others on
this list with a similar problem.  It turned out that after going through
the contortions necessary to change that valve, it wasn't the problem.  My
new mechanic fixed the problem in about 2 minutes by tweaking up the idle
speed.  The engine now runs smooth as butter.
