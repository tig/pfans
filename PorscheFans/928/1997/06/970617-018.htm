Fellow Porsche People:

It has become time to install a new tailpipe and muffler on my 81 US Spec
928.  Everything from the cat back looks like it needs to be replaced.  I
have looked at all offerings from Borla, etc. and they look pretty good and
considerably cheaper than the Porsche muffler system.  I like the idea of
any possible performance benefits and one of my friends has a Mustang
(hopefully 928 convert soon) with the Supertrapp mufflers.  They made a
considerable difference in his car.  Has anyone ran a Supertrapp on their
car?  Will the difference in back pressure affect performance, and will
anything need to be adjusted?  I was also thinking about possible
dual-exhaust set-up with headers and 2 Supertrapps as well.  This would mean
no cats (frowned upon by eco-concious) or 2 cats.  Someone also told me that
exhaust upgrades can give you better gas mileage?  All input greatly
appreciated!

Sincerely,

Sean Nauman
81 US 928 (white/brown)
Moscow, Idaho (No Emissions)

P. S. One more thing, where are the fuel filters located again?
