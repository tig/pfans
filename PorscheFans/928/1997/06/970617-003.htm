Hi, ok, maybe I will delurk permanently, this is fun ;)

Thanks everyone for the H4 help. I surmised now that the previous owner
added the H4's (and the corresponding buckets for them). I guess the "gap
problem" is not really a problem other than aesthetically. Now, I just need
to find some brighter bulbs! 

I just got a set of MSDS headers for my '83 928S, which are absolutely
HUGE, and look great!

My exhaust system is stock. With the exception of my K&N Air Filter,
everything else is too. I plan on adding the Devek High Lift Cams, and
S4 brake upgrade w/stainless lines, but this will be later.

My question: How much effort is required to attach the headers? Will the
motor have to be removed? There was *no* instructions with it, and I cannot
get ahold of the manufacturer. Does the header go into the cat, or does it
completely bypass it? I spoke with the dealer, and he said a Y pipe is
used, and it bypasses the cat. I dunno. Any ideas? How hard of a job am
Iooking at? 

Also, is the performance increase "worth it"? I mean, is there a
*noticeable* increase in performance by adding the headers?

After adding the headers, the high-lift cams, and my air filter (?!), any
ideas as to horsepower? Unfortunately, I know of know dynamometer (sp)
locally. The car is a US model 928 btw.

Thanks!
Larry Flaxman
