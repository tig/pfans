AC parts generally aren't made by the same people who made the car.
There is a surprising degree of AC parts interchangeability between
makes, since all the carmakers just buy their AC parts from a few
manufacturers of AC stuff. I am speaking in generalities, but you
get the idea.

It's sort of like tires. There is no such thing at Porsche tires, Ford
tires, or whatever.
