Try holding the shift lever to the LEFT when making the 1-2 shift. Hold pressure on the left shift gates as if you might be going for reverse. You should feel the reverse gear lockout direct you smoothly into 2nd. And if I'm right you'll be rid of your grinds on 1-2 shifts.

The above is what my '83 928S 5-speed did. On disassembly a $3 spring was broken preventing the reverse gear lockout from working. I've mentioned this before and promissed someone the exact P/N of the broken flat plate spring but haven't got around to digging thru my grocery sack of 928 receipts.

While its only a $3 part the entire transmission has to come out to get to it. Was immediately under the top cover plate. Meanwhile the grind you hear is the reverse gears. Up to '83 the reverse gears physically separated to disengage reverse. For '85 and newer reverse got a syncro. I screwed up and bought the wrong replacement reverse gears for mine and didn't find out until it was too late to return.

As for the broken spring, its one of those things you might not notice if you've not been in a 928 transmission before. Was concerned on reassembly the reverse lockout didn't seem to be working. Studied the parts 'fiche and asked my friend who did my transmission to double check it. Was broken, he missed it the first time around. This flat spring is about the size of a business card. The spring part is only an inch long, maybe 3/16" wide.

Anybody need a set of reverse gears for an 85? Finger dkelly@hiwaay.net. I've had 'em posted there for years.
