Sometimes if you want something done properly you just have to do it
yourself.  If there is one thing my medical training has taught me, it is
that rare diseases are not called rare for nothing, and before you diagnose
one, you had better make damn sure it isn't something much more common which
is fooling you.  Well, I spent some time poking around the area of the
alleged leak in the aluminum a/c pipe and voila, I found a rubber a/c hose
which junctions with a metal pipe immediately adjacent to the "leak" area of
the aluminum pipe (directly below the coil-hose goes from canister
(evaporator?) with check window to metal pipe along passenger side of  engine
compartment.  Sure enough, this area is saturated with greasy moisture (leak
test was done yesterday).  Should be no problem to replace.
