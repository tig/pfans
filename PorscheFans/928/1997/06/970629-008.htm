I've copied the post in question at the end of this message.

....and no one can contradict your good experience. I have no experience
with them at all, but was struck by the (at least apparent) objectivity of
the post I saw castigating them. I'm in no position to judge. I'm glad you
posted your good experiences to the list

Tire technology has advanced enormously in the last ten years, from the
time when tires like the D40 and Michelin XGT were the best around. The
compromises which were necessary then to get good performance are no longer
necessary, plus the performance level at the top is much higher. I'm glad
my pesky advice worked for you.

Subject: RE: 928 Mechanic

Just a quick caveat.  T&D worked on my car throughtout '96 but it got
very frustrating.  Several times I showed up for my car and it was "not
quite ready"; extra time varied from an hour to two weeks!

I had the timing belt replaced (along with many other things) soon
after I got the car.  They never mentioned the 1000 mile readjustment.
 At 1400 miles, I ended up towing it 200+ miles; the belt had jumped
four teeth.  Lucky I've got a two-valver.

After tearing up two Yokohama 008's in 2000 miles with a chronic front
alignment problem they couldn't figure out (it was the alignment shop
they farmed stuff out to), T&D put two USED Fulda(?) tires on my car
and wanted to call it even.

I don't recommend them.  Stick with Devek.
