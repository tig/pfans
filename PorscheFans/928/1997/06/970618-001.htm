Howdy all:

How about we modify 'drag racer' to 'bracket racer' - a big difference!

Anyways, the 'American' quarter mile is but one yardstick to measure your
928's performance as well as your own.  I don't know if it's more fun to
score a win at the drag strip vs. cutting a fast track lap vs. lapping the
state of Nevada at 170 :) but that's probably a personal thing.  Believe me
it's a rush just waiting for the green (any green).  More so if there's a
hotshoe Mustang next to you!  Off to battle we go on any front!

I haven't AX'd either car yet but am scrambling to sign-up for the last GGR
AX sessions at Candlestick - hope I don't spin to wildly!  

I was the only 928 at Sears Point this spring (and probably for years too)
but I might get company with Paul & his car soon!  Lucky guy lives in
Sonoma too!  Jim might join us too?  This is all new to me also and I savor
these exciting experiences!  

Hope I get to line up against those ZR1's next time!  That would be
classic!
Phil

ps.  How about 928's returning to the Salt Lake flats, following the lead
Al Holbert put down?  Anyone have info on this?  I know of at least two
928r's interested already...
