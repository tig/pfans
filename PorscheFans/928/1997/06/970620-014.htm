When I said that I had ignored the "belt tension" indications on several
cars, I meant that the belts were either new or in "like new" condition and
the warning light was on regardless.  I'm  sure that I'm not the only one
who has had these false trouble indications, as I've had six 928s and have
driven them over three hundred thousand miles.  I've had false warning
lights on most of them at one time or another, particularly the belt
tension, and upon having the belts checked, have never found any of them to
be improperly tensioned.  I believe that its' usually Porsche's elctronic
manifestation of the boy that cried wolf.
