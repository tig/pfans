        When I was down at the local Porsche dealer doing some work for them
a guy called in wanting to put on the 911 turbo alloys on his 928, GT I
believe.  The dealer told him it would cost him $4,500 can + his old wheels
and rubber.  They also REMINDED him that the body needs to be pulled out on
the back fenders for the car to accept thoes rims.  He also said to me after
that what they used to do, and also still do, when addind larger depth rims
to the 911's the dealers had a certain base ball bat (Porsche issue OF
COURSE) that when turned accros the circumfrence of the wheel it would leave
a PERFECT buldge in the fender whel.  He said that they've done it for over
13 years a the shop there and knows of atleast 15-20 other shops along the
west coast that do the same!

        I've painted a few cars and know what has to go into the body work
to make it look good.  I wouldn't recommend however for any of you 928 guys
to run out this weekend and, "put the bat into it" as it were!
