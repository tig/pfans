  It's easy to get hooked isn't it?  Just wait until the list goes down
  one day - you feel like 700 friends have just up and left you!

  Would you mind copying me on any responses to this issue that get sent
  to you directly (i.e. those that don't Cc: the rest of the list)?  Since
  I'm considering this upgrade eventually, I'd like to know what I'm in
  for as far as installation.
  
  BTW, the Devek catalog states (for their headers): "The ability of headers
  to augment the output of a stock 4.5 litre USA engine by 30 horsepower is
  well documented."  The dimensions of their headers are 1.625 primaries and
  3" into 2.5" collectors.  How do these dimensions compare to the MSDS?
