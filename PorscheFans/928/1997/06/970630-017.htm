Lest anyone thinks I may have been too harsh here, or, that Matt has
been unresponsive, note that we did have a dialog following this thread
where I volunteered to help Matt create a site, and have been informed
that his site has been removed on his own.  Hopefully to be replaced
with another original,  great page on the 928?

In any event, I encouraged his efforts as he is a 928 fan and hope he
will stick around - I'm by no means perfect either and have and will
make boo-boos of my own...

Whatdayah say, Matt?
