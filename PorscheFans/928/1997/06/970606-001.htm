I like it.  But don't forget this car is a 'system'!  If you add the rear
spoiler, you also need to add the front spoiler too, or else you'd mess up
the aerodynamics of the car at speed.  Heck, might even feel the front
float at 'normal' freeway speeds too.  Not good!

Before you go drilling holes though, how about the S4 spoilers?  I'll post
photos of Paul Carver's '79 that has that setup when I get 'em...  Believe
he has "technology" wheels too so his car must be a looker!

Another option - the super huge wing from Strosek?  This is of course the
start of a major 928 customization and would probably lead to front air
dam, widebody kit, 6-liter engine, etc. !

Let us know what you chose to do,
Phil
