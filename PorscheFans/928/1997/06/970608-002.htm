Hi,

What I think is a sweet deal has fallen into my lap and before I act, I'd
like to get your advice.

I live in Japan, and a friend who works for an Australian car exporting co.
is offering me a left hand drive, automatic, 1983 European specs 928 for
about $6000 US.  In Japan, old cars have little or no resale value so that
is why the price is cheap.  Apparently it has never been crashed and has
about 50,000 kms on it. The leather interior is supposed to be in good shape.

I haven't actually seen the car yet, but I'm going out with a mechanic to
see it this Friday, so I need guidance from you 928 Yodas about what to look
for.

I've always driven standards and bikes because I love the feeling of control
and power a manual transmission gives.  When I drive an automatic, I feel so
passive.  Tell me this isn't true for the 928.  This seems like such a sweet
deal that I can't pass it up even though I think I'd prefer a manual shift.

Thanks,

Jake
