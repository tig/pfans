Hi All!

Mark says "Okay all you Porsche Fans out there!"

Mark, I have exactly the same problem and we are not alone. No one has yet
posted a complete explanation of the 928 climate control to this Digest
although, to be fair, subscriber John White has given many tid bits of
information that I have collected. I mentioned the "fan on high" problem to
my local Porsche mechanic and he mentioned the "resistor group" that you
speak of. They are used for dropping the voltage to the fan for the slower
speeds. Apparently, they get warm and are therefore located somewhere in the
cooling ducts. In typical Porsche fashion, rather than just burn out like
all other cars tend to do over time, these resistors are protected by a
thermostatically controlled shorting switch (probably a bimetallic strip).
And the reason that this activates, according to him, is that the fan
bearings tighten up with age. Thus the fan draws more current and the
cooling air flow is reduced.

Hope this help. When you locate these resistors, let us all know.
