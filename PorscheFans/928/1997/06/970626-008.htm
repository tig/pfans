Griff, I understand the concept and do not disagree, it is a good
solution
to help keep the cost down for all manufacturers.

However, even if there is no Porsche Tires, some of them ar built
to Porsche standared.  They are normally listed with a N0 or N1.  I do
not
recall seing any other parking on tires relating to other car
manufacturer...

(Honda, at least in Canada, tried to get a new kind of tires on the
accord with
the help of michelin.  they used silica insted of carbon in the tires
for improved
wear characteristic without handling loss.  The tires worked well but
had the
disadvantage of giving the occupant large static electric shock due to
the higher
electrical resistance of the tires.  They stopped using the tires on the
Accord and
if you complained enough, they replaced your tires with regular ones)

My gripe is that someone put a Ford compressor that did not Really
fit...
not that Ford is stamped on the AC
