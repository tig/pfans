The driver's side door of my 79 has a couple of problems which I haven't
figured out. Maybe someone can lend some expertise?

I thought that the drivers side, exterior door handle was broken. Well, 
many knuckle flesh chunks later, it's not really the door handle that's
broken...it's the spring-loaded piece that the handle bolts to. This piece
is bolted to the exterior door panel (or some plate tack welded to that).
The nuts of the bolts that hold this spring-loaded piece on are blocked by
the glass of the window.

Next problem: I thought that by moving the window down, I might be able to
get a better look or move to the next logical step which is to temporarily
remove the window while I fix the handle mechanism. 

  ! The window won't go down !

There are 4 leads on the window motor. Only 2 are connected. Why?

Is each lead is a positive connection that drives either an up or down 
motion (relying on the chassis for ground)? 

Or is this a positive/negative pair that drives the motor direction based on
applied polarity?  

Why are there 4 connectors? 

The drivers side motor looks different that the passengers side motor. The
driver's side is a black box and the passenger's side is aluminum and looks 
to be the motor sans any cover. Based on paint and aging, both doors appear 
to be original. 

Any ideas or answers would be appreciated.

TIA
