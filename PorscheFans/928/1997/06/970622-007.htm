Stephane,

I have talked to Ron at EuroSpeed about this tool a few months back.  I
know that the tool is made by Snap-On tools and should be a high quality
item.  At the time, Ron was working to calibrate the tool to the Porsche
tension scale (what ever that is) when I talked to him.

Physically, the tool is different than the OEM tool.  I asked Ron if there
would be any problems with fitting the tool into those tight spots and he
claimed none.

I too would like to hear from someone else that has used this tool and
compared it to the OEM tool.  If there was independent confirmation on the
compatibility of this tool I would buy it right now.

The question is wether using the Snap-On tool at $160 is worth the savings
over the $360 OEM tool (calibration bar excluded).  That is only a $200
savings.  The cost of a belt failure would easily wipe out that savings and
a good bit more.

It is also important to point out that you can still do the job of belt
replacement wrong with the OEM tool too.

If anyone would like to be a test subject, I (and every other list member)
would be very interested in your findings.  Ron's number is 800 352-9441.

Marv
