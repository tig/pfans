> I'm no transmission expert, I paid a friend to do mine. 

I was quite nervous about working on a transmission the first time I
did. I had no qualms about working on an engine, but the transmission
made me nervous--a common reaction.

Transmissions are pretty easy things to repair compared to an
engine. If the part is worn, you replace it. Very few measurements or
judgement calls. Used parts (if your junkyard breaks transmissions
down) are fine and easily inspected, making a big dent in the cost. 

Caveats: I've only worked on the older 911 transmission, not a 928
transmission. I've repaired 3 of them 4 times--I made a serious error
putting torque on a bolt in one that cost me about $500. 

I don't want to get people in over their heads, but if you do a lot of
work yourself, a transmission is not tough. DO use the factory
manuals.
