Howdy All,

Well, its good to be back.  I have just returned from a six week business
trip to Egypt.  It's good to be back in America and to my 928!!!  Now that
my life is going to be a little more peaceful I am ready to do some work on
the 928.  Since the day that I bought it, I have known that it needed the
roller bearings in the torque tube replaced.  I have talked with multiple
sorces about this and seem to get different stories depending on who I
talk with and how much money they think they can get out of me!!!  

I know that there are 3 - 5 large roller bairing in the torque tube that the
drive shaft rides in.  Most mechanics want to completely replace
the torque tube with a rebuilt one, but I don't see a need for that.  Why
not just replace the roller bearings?  Has anyone ever done this on a
928?  Walt Garner, if you are out there, I remember having a
conversation about this with you, but want to make sure that I remember
it all correctly.

One of my biggest questions is about actually removing the Torque
Tube and drive shaft.  I am sure that this is not as easy as removing a
drive shaft from any other rear wheel drive american car, but will I have
to remove the tranny or any other major components or is it as easy as it
sounds?

Please e-mail me directly as well as the list,  if you have any advice.
Thanks,

Matt Butler - 1986 928S
