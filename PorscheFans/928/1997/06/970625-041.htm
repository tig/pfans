Well, this sounds like something out of the X-files but it is true!!
I know that your Porsche history book does not mention this and Ford
is affraid to say anything because some proud american would ban their
product if they realized a US car maker was associated with a German
one.

Here is the proof...

While working on my AC compressor trying to line it up, I noticed that
it had a different shape then the one in the parts book.  I thought,
hey, I got something special here, a factory special.  Well, my
incompetance let to being unable to make the belt line up on the
pulleys and I am stuck to get the more mondain compressor.

So, I take my special compressor off, almost teary eyed, and notice
this logo saying FORD!!!

So there it is, the proof of the alliance

PS.  I do not want to believe this but does anyone think it could be 
another PO missled creativity??
