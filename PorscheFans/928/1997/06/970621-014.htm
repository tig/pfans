Yes. Its either a timing belt or chain.
Yes. One is better than the other.















(Lots of blank lines for dramatic effect.)

Ok, enough for the grammatic sillyness. Think we know what your questions 
were really asking but I just got thru reading the entire May 1997 suite of 
"Ask Dr. Science" an a little has rubbed off.

The 928S uses a timing belt and its probably the #1 topic for maintenance 
discussions. Basically if you have an 85 or newer 32V engine and the timing 
belt breaks you will do a lot of crying. On the older 16V engines you will 
simply have a major inconvienence of having a dead car on the road that 
will have to be towed and a new belt installed before it will run again.

Considering the pains caused owners by timing belts, one might assume 1) 
Porsche wants to keep dealer mechanics employed, or 2) maybe there is some 
good reason to use a belt rather than a chain, or 3) both.

Actually timing chains also fail. But generally a timing chain lasts until 
one needs rings, bearings, and seals. A major exception that comes to mind 
is GM V8's of the 1970's and early 1980's. Lots of those won't go 50k miles 
before the sprockets wear out or the chain wears and slips a cog. 
Especially if you hot dog around. The problem with a chain is to replace it 
you are digging around in the engine oil.

My neighbor build a bracket-drag race car starting with a 454 big block. 
One of the first things he did to the heavily worked engine was to use an 
aftermarket belt drive to replace the chain and sprockets of a standard 
454. He has more $$$ in that engine than I have in my 928S.

In any case, a belt is: 1) cheaper than a chain, 2) lighter than a chain, 
3) quieter than a chain, and 4) mechanically more efficient. So a belt is 
mandated in high performance situations, and a chain for low maintenance.
