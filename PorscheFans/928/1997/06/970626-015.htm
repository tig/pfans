"LOL, Let's not get ethnic", you guys watch too much TV! The guys riding
around in the 850s, are
either rappers or athletes or movie stars. Now the guys at the top of the
dope chain might
own an 850 and they usually don't live in this country. I grew up in the
streets of Philadephia
and the petty dope dealer barely made enough to own a Cutlass because they
usually we skimming
too much dope for personal comsumption. Beside any cash transactions over
$10,000 are reported
to the FBI, and you also need a credit history, checking account and a job
when buying on credit.
Hollywood has done a job on us (lol).

Next time you see an 850 you may want to ask the guy for his autograph
(hehehe).

Why invest in a home or saving when the government will take
care of you for the rest of your life??  They know that, sooner or
later, uncle Sam will provide a good roof, 3 meals a day, HBO, a
good weight room and other good stuff for free...
