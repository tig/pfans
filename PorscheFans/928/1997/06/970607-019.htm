Roy,
Page 66-13 of Factory Workshop manual :
REMOVING AND INSTALLING OUTSIDE MIRROR:
1. Pry off mirror glass (w/black plastic backing) with a putty knife on 
backplate and disconnect contact plugs on glass carefully.
 (Personal Note: move mirror w/ mirror switch to farthest inside view to 
expose visual opening on outside edge of mirror to gain access w/putty 
knife, you will see the metal backplate behind the black plastic/glass 
assembly, pry slowly and evenly in between metal and black plastic, it will 
work .)

2. Unscrew 3 screws through holes in backplate, take off foam rubber part 
and pull off wire plugs.Remove backing plate.

3. Rotate upper mirror housing (they fold backward and forward in case you 
side swipe a Corvette or something on the way by..) in the top of the base 
you will see an allen head screw (6mm?) remove this screw and carefully 
lift complete mirror assembly from door.
(Personal Note: You can unplug connector that is slightly inside the door 
to make the rest of the procedure easier , and less chance of scratching 
the door. P.S. tie a string to the connector in the door or it might fall 
inside door).

4. Look under the base and you will see a hollow threaded stud w/spring and 
washer, then look in bottom right corner of upper mirror housing and you 
will see a nut that is supposed to be threaded on to the hollow threaded 
stud which joins the upper and lower housings. Yours has probably vibrated 
loose.  Rethread the nut and tighten.
(Personal Note: If you can get the nut started you can rotate the upper 
housing clockwise to tighten the assembly.)

Sounds complicated, but really not.
5. assembly is reverse.

BTW the mirrors have plastic clips that snap on backing plate.( no glue 
needed, unless the plastic clips get damaged)
