If I may cut in (I will anyway)

For the people that have built their own archives, please send the
information so I can add it to the FAQ.  This would save me a lot
of time and, like I mention on the FAQ, I like to add things that
people can back up.  This will insure that if someone use the info
from the FAQ, they will get a good idea of what to expect.

I feel that if the FAQ is anything but this, I might as well just
send jpeg of service manual pages to whomever (the page # to stay
legal) and let them fight whatever problem the manual does not
exactly says....
