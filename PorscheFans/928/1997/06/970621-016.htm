Sounds like either the alternator or the voltage regulator.

When you get around to charging your dead battery (the sooner the
better - it is hard on a battery to remain in a discharged state), I
recommend charging it slowly, with a 1 or 2 amp rate.

There is a product called the Battery Tender by Deltran that is a
rather sophisticated battery charger that is ideal for this, and is
also great for cars like the 928 that sometimes don't get driven a
lot.  You can hook this thing up and leave it hooked up, and it will
make sure your battery stays in top condition until you come back. You
should, however, check the electrolyte level at least monthly.

It will not overcharge your battery.

BT's are about $50, but they're well worth it, IMHO.
