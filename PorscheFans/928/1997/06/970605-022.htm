OK - in my 78' 928, which I am driving today for the second time since
I've owned it, where is the oil filler? There is a big canister right
behind the 'crossmember' that says 'OEL' and it has a tube that goes
down into the block, one that goes into the air filter housing and
another that goes into one of the valve covers. It has a big filter in
it and there is oil in the bottom of the chamber. Is this where you fill
it? It is not a standard cap, it has a stud that comes up through the
middle of the cap and a little bolt that holds the cap down.. Never seen
this type of configuration before but this must be it? (Still waiting on
my manuals..!)

Danke
