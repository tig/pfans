Greets,

I seem to have developed a rattle and I cannot find what is causing it. 
Maybe someone has some suggestions??

Clues: 
	It sounds like loose metal.  A light sound, like it is a thin piece of
metal as apposed to a clunck that would come from a dense piece.

It is on the front passenger side of the car.  If the passenger window
is down, the noise is very pronounced.  If the driver window is opened
and NOT the passenger, the sound is much harder to hear.

The noise is not constant.  It is bump related.  Unfortunatly, my 928
considers most deviations in the pavement to be a "bump"

And last but not least, the rattle is brake related.  If I ride the
brake, even a little bit, the rattle will be greatly reduced.  I can put
my foot on the pedal enough to have the brake light turn on but NOT
affect the speed of the car and the sound will almost go away.

What I have checked:

Well, since it seems to be brake related, I pulled of the passenger
front wheel and checked the suspension and brake.  Nothing seems loose. 
Caliper is tight, cannot find any other part that could cause the
rattle.  The only thing I found that might be it would be the brake pad
spring on the caliper.  It was not overtly loose but the rattle sounds
like it could come from a part this thin.  

Does anyone have any ideas???

Thanks.
