(1987-on)
3.Wheel/Tire RDP pressure sensors for 90/91' 928's. $80 each incl. shipping

4.Right and Left power window motors and regulators. DEAL- each side motor
WITH regulator, $160 each side including UPS!
5.Analog clock from 90'-on 928. Needs TLC cleaning. Runs part time. $35

6.PAIR of electric radiator fans/motors/assmbly for 1987-forward. Wait till'
one of your dies and spend $319 EACH new. Now $250 for the PAIR incuding UPS.
Come n' get em.'

7..Also have (2) front and (1) rear factory "Design 90" wheels for S4/GT.
Cosmetically "curbed" on wheel lips in spots. Not out of true or round,
cosmetic only. Ouch! that curb edge!. Can be repaired. Factory painted. From
a 91'GT. $60 each including UPS. Hey you racers, or those who have totalled a
wheel, her'es your chance. This is the wheel as on 944's and 928's. 50 series
in front, 45 series rear.
It's all happening this and next week,  then it comes out in the Panorama
Marketplace, hence it will all go bye-bye at these prices virtually
"overnight" :-)
