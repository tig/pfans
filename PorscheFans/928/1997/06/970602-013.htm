I don't think so, as long as it checks out.

Depends. Does it change pitch with road speed, independent of what gear
you're in? Does its volume or character depend on road surface? How about
during hard cornering or acceleration?

>Are there any similar flaws in 928s?

No. The belt which drives the cams needs to be in good condition (need to
pull a cover to inspect) and properly tensioned (best done with a special
tool). Everything else is quite forgiving.

However, you'll be a lot happier, now and later, if you get a professional
mechanic who knows 928s to check out this car before you buy it. A good
independent shop is often better for this purpose than a dealer.

Not coincidentally, you'll also benefit greatly by using the services of
such a person for work afterward, because this is a complex machine,
occasionally awkward to work on (although it's roomy compared to a Fiero
with a V8!).

>I cannot afford a mistake.

Which is why you should spend the money now to get a through, professional
inspection. Hidden problems can cost a lot to fix later.
