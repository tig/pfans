Subject: RE: "Fast Cars" show on The Discovery Channel

I used to like Jay Leno until after I read an article in Car & Driver. They
were discussing which cars he liked when a recent drive came up. He talked
about a 928, he described it as like being inside a "womb", he felt very
disconected from the car, it felt too big, didn't give enough feedback, and
described the styling to be like a "cocoon" and then went on to say he would
much rather drive a Ferrari any day. Actually I still like Jay, but he can
keep what he thinks about the 928 to himself!

JASON:
Let's give the boy a chance.  1) We all know the sensation of the 928
"shrinking around us," but we also know that it takes a bit of wheel time to
learn this.  One drive, or event a long weekend with a 928, are not enough.
2) It IS like a womb, or a cocoon... low seating position with small, high
mounted windows & windshield, invisible extremities.  3) As a car designed
to perform superbly in multiple venues (autobahn, mountain roads, 300,000
miles of urban roads, all in comfort) it should not be expected to shout
"WOW, have I got hair-trigger throttle response & steering" in the way as a
car (say, a mid-engined Ferrari) that wouldn't last through one icy-salty
winter or carry two toothbrushes at the same time.  This lucky fella can
take his pick of dozens of cars or bikes any day of the week and not worry
about getting to work, now, today.  It might be a different matter if Leno's
show was live instead of taped.  The Ferrari, Diablo, Miura and
(especially!) Harley's might stay in their cozy carages while his 928 got
him to work on time, every time.
