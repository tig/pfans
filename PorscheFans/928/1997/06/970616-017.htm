Hi Everyone,

I just wanted to thank all the folks that contributed ideas to help with
my fast idle problem.  Most of the help was focused on the idle
compensator valve/motor.  I do believe that I need to change the valve
but that is going to be a job for the fall.  I came up with an
alternative measure that has worked for me.  This falls into a "Try this
first" catagory.  I disconnected the negative ground strap behind the
tool holder.  I left the ground disconnected for about 20 minutes
allowing the ECM to return to the PROM standard values and forget the
Aquired values learned over the past 7 months.  It Worked!!! The idle
has returned to normal and all is well with the world.  The only penalty
is that the clock must be reset and depending on the receiver, the
station settings might need to be reset.  For me it was a small price.

Everyone- Thanks again and I will change the valve later.


Best Regards,

Don Vellenga
