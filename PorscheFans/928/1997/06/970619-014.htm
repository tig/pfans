Hi again Jim.  I thought the Automotion kit is just the factory parts
for the newer cars (probably post 86.5, maybe post 85 ??).  I think you
need new lower perches and the adjustors.  Someone else please
confirm/correct.

This one I can answer more confidently - Yes (BTW, confidence is not the
same as correct - YMMV).  With 4 wheels, you can in principle adjust 4
things (4 equations & 4 unknowns - overall height, pitch, roll, and
balance.  Height we've heard all about and some pitch too.  Roll is
pretty clear - both sides the same height.  Corner balance is then
adjusting the weight to be nearly the same on the LF and RR as on the RF
and LR - usually by making the ration of RF/RR = LF/LR.  If you had
super stiff springs and your corner balance was way off, then 1 wheel
would be off the ground (the uneven 4-legged bar stool).  The aim is to
get the effective mounting points for all the springs to be a rectangle
(and not a "twisted" rectangle).  (A potentially key word in the above
is effective because, if, for example, the manufacturing errors for the
spring rates for the RF and LF are significant, then you can compensate
for this with the adjustable perches - a 10 lb difference in rate won't
affect the car's handling much but it will change the balance.)

Specific to your question:  if the RF and LF springs have slightly
different rates or if you car got bent (before you owned it of course),
then you can (and should) still corner balance.  For example, by raising
the RR, you will put more weight on it and more on the LF while taking
weight off the LR and RF.  So you can "exactly" corner balance even if
you have only 2 adjustors (you can't set height, nor can you set the
roll of the car w/o screwing up the balance - that 2 equations 2
unknowns thing).

Hope it helps,
Kurt
