Jorg,

I have done the removal and replacement of the rear window trim. The two
rear quarter windows are the easiest to remove and the toughest to replace.
The back window is the toughest to remove and the easiest to replace.

Quarter windows:

Removal
The back of the metal trim has a ridge running down the middle over its
length. This fit tightly into a groove down the length of the rubber window
gasket. Take a wide flat-blade screwdriver or stiff, narrow putty knife and
*gently* lift the trim near one of the two corners. Lift both the upper and
the lower metal strips at the corner just enough to expose the metal corner
piece. Wiggle the corner piece off (the strips just slide into it). You can
no start *gently* pulling the metal strips out of the rubber. Make sure you
hold the metal right at the location you pulling from or you'll bend the
metal. The factory manual suggests putting a strip of cloth under the metal
and pulling on the cloth ends while sliding it down underneath the metal.
Caution and patience are key because the metal is fairly easy to bend.

Replacement
This is easier to describe but, I found, tougher to do. Make sure all the
parts and the rubber channel are perfectly clean. Do this in a warm area so
that the rubber is as pliable as it can be. Get some water-based slippery
liquid such as glyceran. I used my daughters bubble pipe soap. Coat the
rubber channel and the back of the trim generously with the soap. Assemble
the trim strips and the corners into a single unit. Have a helper hold one
end and you work on the other. Start at one corner and push the strip into
the channel. Apply lots of pressure with your thumb or heel of your hand
and slide along the strip, pushing it into the rubber channel.


Rear Window:

Removal
Get a stiff, wide putty knife and a small piece of wood roughly 1/2 inch
square by 6 inches long to use as a fulcrum. From the glass side of the
trim insert the putty knife under the trim and the wood under the putty
knife. Gently pry up under the trim. If you have lots of light and look up
under the trim, you should be able to see the exact location of the nearest
retaining clip. Reposition your tools at that location and pry the trim up
until it pops off the clip. Continue around the window in this fashion.
It's very easy to bend the trim if you get in a hurry. Don't.

Replacement
This is the easy part. Mark on the glass the locations of the plastic
retaining clips. I used a magic marker, but pieces of masking tape would
work great too. Assemble the trim pieces with their 'joiners' and lay the
assemble unit in place. Have a helper keep things in place on one side of
the car while you work on the other side. Push the trim into place with the
heel of your hand at the locations of the retaining clips. Done.
