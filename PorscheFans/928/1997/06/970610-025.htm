  This same problem has just started happening with my sunroof.  Putting some
  grease on the tracks helped the sliding motion, but I still have a 
  problem with the motor straining when trying to make the seal against the 
  roof.
  
  I've taken the roof out a few times before.  Aside from the fact that
  it weighs a lot for as small as it is, taking it out to make
  adjustments isn't difficult if you follow the shop manuals (and some
  tips that I've learned (but can't remember off the top of my head - I
  did write them in my manuals though)).
  
  To those that have dealt with this type of problem before, does it
  sound motor related or cable related?
