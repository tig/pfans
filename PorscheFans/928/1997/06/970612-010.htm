I put these springs on my '85 928, which was already a bit low. The
Automotion springs dropped it more than an inch (turns out it varies from
car to car). I liked the improvement in transient response. As with any
lowered Porsche, you have to be wary of driveways, speed bumps and other
steep transitions, or just keep a stock of front spoilers on hand...

BTW, I also put the Weltmeister front sway bar on the car, and I found the
stock sway bar mounts inadequate for the cornering loads I was able to
generate. Reinforce 'em if you're going to autocross!!!

Automotion for the past 20 years)
   1997 Carrera S
   1981 928 Carelli convertible
   1972 911T track car
   1996 Explorer parts fetcher

P.S. I recently put Bilstein front struts in my 928, and the labor cost
about as much as the struts, so be sure you're prepared for that.

P.P.S. Congrats on the rally trophy!
