Hello every one!

	This is my first mail message to this 928 enthousiast group.  I was
very happy to find you guys.  It is really hard to find people that like the
928.  My first crush on this car was when I saw it in "Weird Science" then in
"Risky Business"  cool...  Then a couple of my friends had 928s in Saudi Arabia.
One was a purple/red 88 S4 Auto (didn't like that one much), the other a 1991
928GT Olive Green with black interior.  The GT was a blast (5-speed).
	Anyways, I have been looking for a 928S4 87, 88 or 89 with 5-speed
(very rare apparently) or 89 or 90 GT with 5-speed.  Most probably, the S4
would be more in my budget.  But the 5-speed is really hard to find.  I want
it low milage, preferably Black. Perfect condition is a must, for I am planning
to keep this one till death do us part!

Top preference :

1989 928S4
5-Speed
Black/Black or Black/Grey or Black/Creame
Perfect and Excellent condition
Low miles
Full Option

	If anyone knows someone that can help locate a car for sale, please
email me with phone number.  I am having real trouble in finding one!

Long live the 928!

Khaled Badr
