>>100, but I recommend you  stay away from them.  

      (Not to cause an argument, but to bring up a good point) The factory 
units are good, mine lasted  about 70K miles. The good rebuilds are usually 
factory units, with new bearings, assebled by hand, each one tested 
individually, and shipped directly to the customer. The cost is $100 - $250. 
On the other hand, the factory unit -COULD- have been made in Germany, more 
than 3 years ago, sat on a shelf for two more years. Then it -MIGHT- have been 
shipped over here (across 6000 miles of saltwater) to whatever port of entry, 
then unloaded, maybe dropped, sent via truck to the dealer, where it sat for 
another year, and got dropped two more times. When they sell it, the bearings 
and seals are so dry that it olny lasts for another six months. The cost 
$350+.
	
In the course of replacing the waterpump (if that turns out to be the
problem), I also suggest you  get new timing belt, accessory belts,
thermostat, and belt tensioner (tensioner only if needed). 
 
Good advice! 

The above was just my wheels in motion when I was shopping for my H2O pump. 
Although it is an extremely hypothetical situation, it isn't totally 
impossible.
