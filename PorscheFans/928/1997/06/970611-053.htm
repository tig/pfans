I had the same problem.  The roof panel has full adjustment at all four
corners for position both height and location.

1. Open roof all the way.
2. The inner leather panel is held in by a trim strip that is now
exposed.  Remove 3 (or was it four) scres that hold the strip, pull
strip off and leather panel forward and out.
3. Close roof all the way.
4. Get into car, look up and see the four adjustment screws for
height/levelling.
(for/aft location is via shimmed screws)
5. Adjust level of roof so that it is at or slightly below level of
surrounding body.
6. Check function to make sure it doesn't rub when openned or closed.
7. Reopen roof, replace leather innder panel and holddown strip.
8. Touchup and rub out scratches.

Good luck.  I did this an no more scratches!
