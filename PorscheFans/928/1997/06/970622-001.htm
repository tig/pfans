Actually, here in Europe 18" wheels are (were) a factory listed option... they are
mentioned also in Mr. Tong's 928s4vr page (good job, BTW). Weather these will
fit an S4, which does not have the widened rear wheel arches (fenders ?) is another
story entirely, but since I have seen S4s with GTS 17" wheels and the 18" are the
same exterior diameter and width, I guess that there should be no 
problem; the external form factor does not change: you have less rubber and more 
aluminium. As to "the 18s will stress the suspension too much", well, 
it is true that with a tyre with a lower sidewall you lose some of the absorbing
effect of the tyre itself, but saying that this will overstress the suspension
is IMHO a little excessive.

Me too :)
