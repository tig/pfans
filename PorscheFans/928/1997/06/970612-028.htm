<<I was told that the 928 has the same offset as the 1996 turbo . I wanted to

know if any one has put them on the car ? or if any one has any oppinions?>>

I was told by my Porsche technician that 18" rims and tires would not fit on
the my 87 928S4.  The newer GTS's do have the wider body work, which may
allow for 18's, but after looking at the body clearance on my 17" rims I
would tend to agree that my technician is correct.  I believe another reason
that he gave (he quoted a recent Porsche service letter) was that teh 928
suspension would be put under too much stress by 18's.  Maybe I am
remembering incorrectly.  If you wantto buy the tires then more power toi
you!  Mine eats up the rear tires b/c of the immense amount of torque the car
produces.
