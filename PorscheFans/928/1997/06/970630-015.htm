  In anticipation of changing to new springs, I've been studying my
  existing spring/shock setup and the workshop manuals quite a bit lately.
  I'm still unsure of the mechanical connection between height adjusting
  collars and the shocks.
  
  My car only has height adjustment in the rear, and on those, I can
  see the threads on which the adjustment collar turns.  Are those threads
  actually tapped into the shock itself, or does the shock ride in a
  housing that accomodates the collar/spring seat?  The shocks (or housing?)
  on my car are black, indicating standard Boge fitment.  Would the
  colors of the other brands be readily apparent (assuming dust and dirt
  were removed) or would I have to remove some things to actually see
  the shock?
  
  On the front, the collar for the lower spring perch is simply wrapped
  around the shock (or housing).  When upgrading to adjustable collars,
  what keeps the collar secure around the shock and what component
  supplies the threads?
