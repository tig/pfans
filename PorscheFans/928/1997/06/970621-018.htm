It's the car to have when you're just having one.

I'd like to know. What did you do with the proceeds?

Nothing better!

Well, the 850 is much better regarded by, and more popular with, successful
dope dealers. It's also a lot slower than the GTS, so you'll be safer when
you drive without paying attention. It's also even more mechanically
complex than the GTS, so you can pay more keeping it on the road. It
probably also has a fancier computer and more elaborate climate control, so
you can keep yourself busy when the car bores you to tears.
