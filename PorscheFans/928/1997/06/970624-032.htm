Encouraged by suggestions about shortening and/or replacing the shift
lever on 928s, I decided to try it out for my own '82 928:

I purchased the shifter lever and boot from a wrecked 1986 928 to use
just in case I messed up.  I thought I'd just shorten the '86 lever,
remove my assembly and put in the new one while keeping my origional
shifter just in case some subsequent owner (or myself) became obsessed
with origionality.

Naturally, I whacked 2" off the end of the '86 shifter with a hack saw,
and reshaped the end with a grinder before removing my own shift lever. 
BAD IDEA.

The '86 shift lever control rod holes are closer together than those on
my '82.  So were the holes in the lever.  The later shorter GTS shift
lever will probably prove to have the closer-together holes, similar to
the '86, so that recommendation will probably not work for '82 or
earlier 928s. In addition, a plastic bushing shaped like a "figure 8"
from the '86 was too short for my '82.

So...  I pulled my own 1982 shift rod, whacked off 2" and reshaped the
end appropriately.  I cut 1.25" off the end of the shift knob so it
wouldn't interfere with the rubber bellows boot (under the leather). 

Procedure I used but DON'T recommend:

1.  Pry up with wide spatula the snap-in plastic base of the shift boot
(or just pull up on leather boot) then pull the boot up to expose the
shaft of the shift lever.

2.  Pull up the rubber bellows boot that keeps dirt out of the shift
linkage to get access to the shift rods.

3.  The shift lever is pushed onto pins which stick out of the shift
rods, held under spring tension with circlips.  When you remove the
circlips, the spring tension should move the lever to the left.

4.  Keep working the lever until it slides off the pins.  Count and
inspect your parts.  You should have two circlips, the lever, two
springs, and one plastic "figure 8" bushing (in that order left to
right).  Be aware, there are also 4 plastic bushings that go into the
inside and outside of the metal tubes (which are welded into the shift
lever) that slide over the pins.  If any of these are broken, you might
need to get replacements. In fact get a couple anyway, you'll probably
break one or more trying to get it all back together again.

5.  Remove the shift knob.  I squirted a little Vinylex into the base
and it slipped right off.

6.  It is ok to cut 1.5-2.0" off the end of the lever.  I cut 2.0" off
mine using a hacksaw.

7.  You need to reshape the newly cut end of the lever to match the end
you cut off - if you want to reuse the old knob & boot.  I used a bench
grinder.

8.  Now comes the fun part - putting it back in.  It took 10 mins to
remove, 20 mins to modify and two+ hours of sweating and swearing to get
it back in.

9.  It was VERY difficult to get everything back together.  The little
bushings wanted to slide out as I tried to work the lever back onto the
pins. Then the lever would slide oton the pins, but the bushings would
slide out!  Finally I had to use a long-nosed ViseGrip pliers to
compress the springs once the lever was on the bushing and then other
pliers to force on the circlip.  I was only able to do one at a time,
but after one circlip was on, the other went a little easier. WHEW!
(There are also at least two differing designs of circlips.  The ones
used on the '82 were a lot easier to get on and off than the ones on the
'86.  The '86 style circlips probably are smaller because of the closer
spacing of the pins and holes on the shift lever.)

10.  Shorten skirt of shift knob 1.25" (if you cut 2" from the lever). 
I used my pocket knife.

11.  Replace rubber boot, shift knob and leather boot. 

PROCEDURE I RECOMMEND:

1.  Pull up on the leather boot.
2.  Squirt some Vinyl protectant up under the shift knob. Use a
scredriver to pry   out the skirt of the knob a little.  It won't matter
if a chunk breaks off 'cause you will have to trim it later anyway.
3.  Wiggle the knob back and forth, pulling gently (or not-so-gently)
until the knob with boot comes off.
4.  Pull off rubber boot.
5.  DO NOT REMOVE CIRCLIPS (if in doubt read 8 & 9 above).
6.  Put towels around the lever so metal filings won't go everywhere.
7.  Shorten to desired length with hacksaw - freehand.
8.  File/reshape end of shifter while still in car - use hand file.
9.  Spend some time cleaning up the filings.
10. Replace rubber boot, knob and leather boot.
11. Have a cool one and congratulate yourself for not making the
mistakes I did.
