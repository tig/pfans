Hi Chip, 
Great to hear from you, I actually got rear ended very close to where the
club meets
(63rd & Memorial) . Jeff Huber was Highly recommended by many other people in
Tulsa, and Insurance Co. was glad to hear I was taking my car to the best. He
is a very nice guy and if anybody lives out in the bonnies near OK, this
would probably be the guy to work with.  Chip I'm very interested in getting
involved with the club Please let me know of any other details if you know of
any. ( I bought my car from the guy that owns MONDOS italian Rest.)
Thanks 
Glenn
