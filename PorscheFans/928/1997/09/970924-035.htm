heavyweight Beefy-T's, white shirts with black printing - small logo on
front pocket area and large logo back print.  $14.95 + s/h (a buck or
two USPS).  Reserve yours now by sending check or money order to:

Phil Tong
PO Box 471292
SF CA  94123

But wait there's more!   Alan Ng has kindly produced cool 928 Owners
Club business cards that we could hand out to other owners to let them
know about 'us' !  It has a raised logo on the front, with some text on
the back.  Send me a SASE and I'll stick a bunch in for your enjoyment /
928 memorabilia collection!

*************

Final note and this one's more of a poll:
Considering a run of baseball style caps.  What would you prefer?

Embroidered logo?
Printed logo?
Cap color?

Reply now - Your vote counts!
Thanks,
Phil
