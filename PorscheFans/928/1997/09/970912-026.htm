Someone in the past few days attempted to explain the Corvair problem
that Nader made his rep on. Well, there was a real problem, which Nader
identified, that GM quietly fixed with the 1965 model.  Pre 1965
Corvairs had a rear swing axle with no articulation at the wheel. When a
car like that goes to final oversteer, the outside rear wheel tucks
under, and w/o articulation it goes too far and the car rolls.  This
also occurs in a skid or a rear wheel blowout. In 1965 GM articulated
the wheel and thereafter they handled just like a Porsche.Well, in
principle. I had a '65 Monza convertible a few years back and, with some
suspension tweeks, it was really fun to drive. It needed more power tho,
and that was more difficult to obtain. Its a really great car to pour
money into and then sell at a big loss. Sound familiar?
