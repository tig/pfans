Hello!
>>Oh wise ones:   how does one install the 23mm O-ring on the cam shaft?

>>This is the one that fits inside the spacer?  Re:  ppg 15-6, item #16
in
>>the porsche manual.  I have failed in attempts to drive it on, then
Oh yes.... that little ring.....  cost me ~4 hours of grief during my
Euro head swap...
What I finally did was:
Located in my "misc socket" drawer, a socket that was stepped up like a
ramp where the final diameter squished the O-ring up into it's groove,
the theory being that I could start the spacer sliding over the small
end of the socket ramp it up until it is tight over the big end of the
socket, and center this socket against the end of the cam, and then whap
it into place on the cam.  However, this was plagued with problems:  The
"butt" end of the socket needed to be milled flat because it had a
radius that the O-ring fell into.  Then, after many attempts to hold the
socket in place, I got bright enough to bolt newly created "O-ring
installation socket tool" to the end of the cam using one of the cam
gear bolts (minus hex washer) tightly and aligned perfectly with the end
of the cam.  Now I had a solid, greased, ramp all ready to slide that
@%$# spacer up!  I would advise heating the spacer some at this time,
because I did not, and when I finally did drive this spacer on, the cam
end cut a sliver off the ID of the O-ring.  This sliver was so thin you
could see through it, and was perfectly formed, so I opted to leave it
in rather than replace the O-ring again.  I have no leaks, but if you
heated the spacer, and gained even .001 I think that the whole O-ring
would go on the shaft.....

E-mail me if you need verbal description of this event!!

Stay Strong!!
