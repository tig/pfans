>>Hi!  I am considering buying a 928, so I've been looking in all the local

>>looking in the under $10,000 range.  I am concerned about the dependability
>>as a daily driver (about 90 miles a day, 4 days a week) and the traction on
>>Snow and Ice.  I am also wondering about the typical maintenance costs.  I am
>>mechanically inclined and can do major repairs and change transmissions,
>>rearends, etc., but I don't have the equipment to work on fuel injection or
>>in-car computers.  Anyway, I'm wondering if any of you long term owners of
>>late 70s/early 80s 928s can give me advice on what to look for (and look out
>>for) when checking over a used 928 before buying it.  I've also heard that
>>there were problems with the clutch on the early 928s and that an automatic

>>ones ('85 and up?) and I'm wondering if it is still pretty quick ( I had an
>>automatic 1984 Mustang GT convertible-4428 lbs. and 205 horsepower, and I

>>about 10 miles of twisty mountain road and 30 straighter miles on my daily
>>commute).  Thanks In Advance.

Let me offer a few facts and opinions...

Mine is a daily driver, for a lot fewer miles though. It is remarkably
dependable for a 14-year-old car (Oct 83 build date), but you have to
realize that it will take constant maintenance. It's a slippery slope
once you start putting off little repairs, so you need to keep after
it. My one major expense has been rebuilding transmission and
replacing the torque tube.

With Dunlop SP8000's the car was an absolute pig in the snow. I hope
it will be better with different tires, but it won't be as good as
a front wheel drive car with skinny tires. 

Lots of electrical stuff in the car, leading to lots of electrical
problems in early cars (many connector-related), but nothing
too exotic; no digital computers in those. No indication that the
clutch is a problem, but it is unusual in that it's dual-plate,
giving twice the friction surface in a given diameter. If you
will spend a lot of time in stop-and-go traffic, an automatic is
nice, otherwise a manual is even nicer.

Power is adequate for all rational purposes (but who said we're
all rational?) - the early 928 weighs 1000 lb less than that
Mustang, and has about the same power. Handling is "very
forgiving" (said to me by an instructor after I screwed up
royally and got away with it). 

As for what to check on a used car: first, figure out who is the
best local 928 mechanic (you could ask this list, for starters),
then find a car you like, then let the mechanic check it out.
Incidentally, that mechanic may very likely NOT be affiliated
with a Porsche dealer, in my experience anyway.
