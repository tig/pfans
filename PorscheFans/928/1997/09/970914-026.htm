Just an FYI
I took my recently purchased '90 S4 into the shop to fix the items discovered
on the buyers inspection. One was a leaking transaxle (green Swepco oil on
the floor). Well, I had to return the car 4 or 5 times because the leak
didn't stop despite their best attempts. It is a reputable Porsche shop.
 They finally said the only thing left was a porus casting, where the fluid
would sweat thru the housing. I was skeptable, but after they epoxy coating
the housing and  the leak stopped.

Anybody have any similiar experiences.
