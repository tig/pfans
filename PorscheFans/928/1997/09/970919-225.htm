The problem only occurs when the parking lights or headlights are
illuminated. This is a well-documented problem having to do with current
consumption. Everyone I know who has done the conversion has decided to
live with the taillight warning light coming on... or removing bulbs.

I appreciate your taking the trouble to check, but if you added the
headlights to the equation, it might come out differently.

No, the electrics are fine. The problem can be averted altogether by
pulling the outermost bulbs from the taillight assembly. Some mechanics
have allegedly employed a bridge resistor in the circuit to cut current
consumption.

Thanks for your help.
