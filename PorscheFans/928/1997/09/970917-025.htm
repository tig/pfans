 That is going to be very hard to do.  My *opinion* is that with the 
available gears in these cars, it will take some serious broad-band 
torque, to do this.  I'll count myself lucky if my turbo 928, even at 
550-600hp, gets into the 10's. I assume you want this on street tires, 
too, which invites the obvious traction problems.
 The best bet would be a stroked S4, modified Bosch Motronics 
Fuel-Managment System, headers, flow-thru exhaust, etc.  Devek can supply 
all parts (except maybe the Motronics mod.)  And if 1/4 mile times are 
*really* important, custom grind a gear set--atleast the final ratio and 
possibly consider a 5-6lbs boost Vortech.
 In case anyone is interested, and if my turbo mod is as successful as it 
looks to be, I and a local high performance shop are very seriously 
considering "kitting" it.  Anyone e-mail me if you would be interested, 
so we may gauge the potential market. (Also, this design will go on all 
years with no major, and practically zero minor mod's to the vehicle. We 
have outlined 3 stages of upgrades--400hp, 500hp, 575hp (est.).  A fourth 
stage may exist that will involve replacement of pistons, and head gasket 
for 650hp+.)  Let me know if there is any real interest.
