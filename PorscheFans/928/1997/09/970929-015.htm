Wats?

I have the same problem with the power seats in my 88 S4, since I am
tall and run the seats all the way back.  When they are all the way
back, they tend to get off the track when you sit in them, which is, of
course, the idea.  I guess the weight of the sitter pushes the seat off
the track.  Fortunately, if you jiggle the seat firmly back and forth
while holding down the power forward control you should be able to get
it to catch the track again and it will move forward with the control.
Since I am the only driver, this is not much of an irritation for me,
but if you are sharing the driver's seat this trick is helpful.

PS I've had to share this with the techs from time to time, although it
does not seem like rocket science to me.
