At the very bottom of all the ducts etc that make up the inside parts of 
the heating / air conditioning system is a catch tray. This is is also 
the bottom of the ducts that feed air to your feet. At the rear of this 
part is a rubber hose that exits towards the front of the car and then 
does a 90 degree turn and exits through the tunnel to the bottom of the 
car. I would not suggest a piece of wire jammed up there as the rubber 
looks like it might tear without enormous difficulty. My suggestion would 
be to do it from inside the car. You should be able to see what needs to 
be seen by removing the kick plate and side cover from the center consul. 
You might even be able to tell if this is your problem by shoving your 
hand up the vent and feeling around. If it stinks that bad you could have 
some mutant life form living in there so a rubber glove might be an idea 
to consider. Why does this remind me of a Seinfeld episode?
