There is a lot of talk lately on stuff to put in your radiator, I have always
wondered about the following:  Would there be benefits in flushing your
system and replacind it with demineralized or distilled water along with the
proper mix of antifreeze?
Im guessing the lack of minerals would reduce deposits, but would it effect
the way the water takes and gives up heat.  The answer may be obvious, but I
cheated my way through chemistry and physics, who would of ever thought i
would need it.


Guess it kinda depends on the quality of the water in your area, here 
there's not much point from the the mineral standpoint. Although we
use tap water in bateries here too(ours is clean) the idea of flushing 
if a car has an unknown or uncared for history is one I do on problem cars.
 Acid is usually more of a concern, and from what I've heard many of the antifreeze manufacturers don't much care about it either. I ph test mine as I believe
it will eat aluminum.


  So can somebodyu answer my earlier question?
