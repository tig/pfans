Please try your test again in a week or so and let us know the results.

Well, the thermostat (in this or any other liquid-cooled car engine) has a
far more limited role than you may think. It only determines whether or not
the coolant will be sent through the radiator (versus just circulating
within the engine). The thermostat generally opens up after the initial
warm-up (which otherwise would take too long, exposing the engine to damage
and depriving the car's occupants of heat in cool weather) and then stays
open. From that point forward, the coolant flows through the radiator,
there to get rid of excess heat from the engine.

The harder the engine works, the hotter the outside air, the more slowly
you're moving through that air, the leakier your water pump, the lower the
heat transfer capacity of the coolant mixture, and (here's the Water Wetter
part) the less effective the thermal contact between the coolant and the
inside surface of the radiator, the higher the coolant temperature.

Once the path to the radiator is open, there's nothing else for the
thermostat to control (the electric cooling fans are on their own thermal
switch), so your coolant temperature will go up and down as any or all of
these factors change.
