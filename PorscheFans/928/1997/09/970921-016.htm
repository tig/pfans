  Gene,

If you can find us a "pro" that can do a  PROPER 4 wheel alignment on a =
928 for $39.95 (no matter how long it takes, I think most of us would =
give you a $50 finders fee, I know I would. ;-)

I have found only one person who can do a proper alignment in the metro =
Atlanta area (aligning Porsches for over 17 years) and his standard 4 =
wheel alignment is $140, of course I could take it to NTW and pay them =
$99 to use a hammer on my suspension.

P.S. I think maybe we all should encourage, not discourage anyone who =
learns how to do their own technical work on their 928s, especially if =
they share that valuable knowledge with us.

Just a thought,=20
