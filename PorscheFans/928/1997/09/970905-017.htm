<<I've talked to superchips in Fl and it sounds

interesting. Has anyone tried their product? They told me 400 for the set.

 I'm new to this site and really getting into it.>>

Victor,
I've heard very bad things about SuperChips.  Wouldn't even consider them.
 However, I have the AutoThority chips in my 87 928S4 and love them.  Bought
them from EuroProducts b/c they were a few hundred dollars cheaper there than
from AutoThority direct.  They can fax you hp ratings, torque specs, warranty
info, etc.  Another choice is to do what Leonard Laub (who is on this list)
did - he had his chips custom made and then had his car tested on a dyno.
 These would be the only two choices I would recommend that you consider.
 And BTW, your 928 wasn't topped out at 146 was it?  I've had mine to 167
before the mods and ran out of nerve/road before the car ran out of steam.
 Good luck!
