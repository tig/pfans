And why would you want holes instead of the surface slots Porsche uses
on the 928's front rotors? These slots do not affect rotor rigidity the
way holes would. Plus the slots address the possible need for venting
gas under the brake pads.

I still don't know why we don't have aluminum windshields. Saw Scotty
type up the plans for transparent aluminum on an old Mac Plus. Then they
made a big sheet of it and turned the cargo bay of a Romulan warbird
into an aquarium for whales. And saved the future earth in the process.

I'll bet transparent aluminum is part of the conspiracy which is keeping
100 MPG cars that can do 0-60 in 4 seconds off the streets.  :-)
