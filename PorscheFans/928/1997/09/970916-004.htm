LL, and rest,

Actually I spend way to much time reading Star Wars stuff...so here goes.
 While to the novice (and indeed everyone else till a Star Wars book was
written a few years back) it did sound as if Han Solo was using it as a
measure of speed.

In reality it was a measure of distance as the system to which he is refering
(Kessel) is surrounded by black holes that take a very intricate path to get
through...most take a longer path and he was expressing that his ship was
powerful and fast enough to take a shorter trip to the same system from that
given location (Tatooine).

So, it is obvious that indeed he did use the proper nomencalture to discribe
both the Falcon and the Kessel run.  I certainly hope that clears up all of
the questions surrounding this terrible misunderstanding.

See ya'
