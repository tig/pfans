I used to drive a Hnoda CRX in Timmins Ontario.  Ice and Snow were very
common
and the CRX was also fairly low to the ground.  I put a set of Michelin
XSM 100
(or something similar) on the car and I remember driving in thick snow
and leaving
an imprint of the bottom of the car.  Still had good traction even on
ice.

Of course, the 928 would have the disadvantage (in this case) of having
a lot
of power and being rear wheel drive.  But with the right tires (Michelin
XSM 300
for the larger tires) and probably a 60 series tire, you should be able
to move
around.  Would I do it, no way.  My choice would be to buy a junker for
heavy 
snow days.

Just my $0.02.
