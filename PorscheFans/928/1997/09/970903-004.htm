hey kevin, the best way to deal with attitude is to disregard it.
i have driven lots of cars that cars heads to spin and comments to fly. so
much that the female has refused to ride in certain ones, cuase she doesnt
like to have people stare at her or spew comments every where we go. hows
that for a dilemma.

right now i have a hummer wagon and a c4 turbo with rsr bodywork [ gotta
cover those 275's and 315's] as my daily drivers. i didnt buy them or drive
them to be seen, they are totally functional and i use them for what they
are ment to be used for.  i have major window tint, and treat them like
cars, not furniture. i bought these for me, not for the world. i flamed my
928 for me, and caught more shit than a confinement house in the summer.
ove the years the best way to deal for me has been to be polite, to say yes
it is a nice car, they are not as expensive as you think, yes,  blah
blah... thankyou, and if they are being pricks, well i just change the
subject, or laugh at their jokes. you are the same person you were before
you bought the car, and do not let them alter that.
and if all else fails, tell them to f*** off, and get a life so they dont
have to spend time interfering in yours.
