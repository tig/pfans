Well, Colonel Stapp -- my late 85 India Red/Black 101k 5speed -- is
(finally!) back from the body shop with a new coat of PPG's finest clear
coat.  This was following a comprehensive "key job" by at least two perps...
you can tell by their handwriting; the right side was straight lines, the
left side & hood was swirls!  Ah well, at least the color of the bumper caps
now match the body...

As I expected, in the course of reassembly, some of the electrical stuff is
not the same as before, to whit:

1) the interior hatch release no longer works (driver's side, the passenger
side didn't work before).  No motor noise at all.  Of course, the door IS
open when I try this (Porsche has a safeguard that prevents this from working
when both passenger doors are closed).
2) None of the interior lights work.  All worked prior to dis/re-assembly.
3) The "tail light" warning light comes on when the headlights are on.  All
exterior lights DO work (turn signals, side marker lights, driving lights,
tail lights, brake lights, reversing lights, CHMSL).  NOTE: My instrument pod
does have some pre-existing intermittent glitches: light behind water temp
guage inoperative; on low fuel the gas guage only functions after tapping the
guage; speedo doesn't "catch" until about 15-20mph.)  Pushing the console's
"!" button turns off that "!" light (indicating a "not serious" flaw) but
comes on again about 15-20 seconds after dousing/relighting the headlights.

I'll be taking the Porker back next week for some minor touch up.  I would
greatly appreciate any advice on where to have them look for the source of
these problems.  Thanks!

P.S.
re: aluminum flex.  As all have noted, this is hogwash.  However, NO
"pre-CAD/supercomputer" unibody structure will be as strong (per pound) as a
designed-for-rigidity structure created using this technology.  My last car,
an Infiniti G20 4-door, was noticably more rigid than the 928.
