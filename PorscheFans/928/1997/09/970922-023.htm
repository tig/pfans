Hi Shark Drivers

Well I just finished my first autocross this Saterday (PCA event in
Dublin California) and it was great fun!  I know that 928's are not
designed with autocrossing in mind but it sure increases your driving
skill.  There was only one other 928 in attendance I would really like
to see a few more next saterday September 27, same place, and October 4
at Candlestick (if the Giants aren't at home,  the Candlestick
autocrosses are supposed to be higher speed therefore better suited to
928's)
Racing really wears out tires fast I guess becouse 928 are so heavy with
relativly narrow tires.
I plan on driving more autocrosses and then some time trials so I need a
second set of rims I am looking for 4 8x16 S4Rears or wider. These will
be used for racing so I am looking for the cheapest wheel available
(badly scratched ok).  With so many people talking about upgrading to
17' wheels I hope there are some available.
Can anybody help me in my search? 

Thanks in advance
