Dear Mark & fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

I drove my '86 16V briefly on Sunday, and noticed a burning oil smell 
from the engine compartment.  When I opened the hood, smoke was coming 
from the right (passenger side) cylinder bank exhaust manifold.  
Although I didn't remove the air intake hoses to get a good look at the 
valve covers, I could tell that oil was leaking onto the exhaust, from 
across the TOP of the covers near the front.  I was relieved to discover 
that the leak is NOT from the cam bearing ends but appeared to be right 
above the exhaust header, but not from the valve cover gasket.  

Does anyone have any ideas? 
Is there a crankcase ventilation outlet on the covers near there?

The problem is most likely the rubber oil return line. I had one crack and
leak oil under high RPM. At low RPM it did not leak oil but was a noticeable
vacuum leak. It must be replaced. I replaced mine with a re-enforced fuel
hose (not OEM) and that took care of it. The OEM hose will in time react
with the oil and deteriorate.

Happy motoring. ED
