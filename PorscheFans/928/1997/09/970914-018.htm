<<Mine's the same. Once it hits full scale, it stays there until I shut the

engine off at the end of my journey.



I might hook a digital meter up to the oil pressure sender and monitor it.

A PO might have hooked the gauge directly to +v to hide an oil pressure

problem. (Shudder!)>>

I had problems with my guage and the last time I changed my oil I managed to
fix them fairly easily.  I will ad that I had called to order a new sending
unit, and they were out of stock so I changed the oil with plans to change
the sending unit on the next oil change. 

The sending unit sits next to the drain plug.  It has a black plastic
connector harness.  This connector plugs into the sending unit from the
bottom of the car.  The harness then forms a cup that can collect all kinds
of oil, grease, grime, and other road sludge.  This fouled the contacts on
mine.  I unplugged it and filled the cap with brake clean and let it sit for
30 minutes or so, then flushed it out repeatedly with brake clean.  I tapped
the sending unit with my ratchet, gently, several times to attempt to loosen
any sludge that might be in the galleys.  I re-installed, and bingo,
everything worked fine.  It has been about 4K miles since then, and  no
problems.  It makes a world of difference in knowing when the engine, not the
coolant, is truly warm, and ready to play.

Stephane, I believe, originally told me how to change the sending unit.  This
info, along with the info on changing the unit (including wrench size, as if
I remenber correctly it is large) should be in the faq.  It is a common
complaint.  The guage didn't work on my other 928 either.
