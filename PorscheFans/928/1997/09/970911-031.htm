Are you stating the 928 is an aluminum car? I don't consider it to be.

Nader never recognized what he actually demonstrated, that the Corvair 
handled differently than the typical Detroit iron. Then to make things 
worse, an aftermarket appeared selling "suspension performance 
enhancements" (new springs, sway bars, bushings, etc.) An aftermarket 
suspension performance market was unheard of at the time. Nader's 
conclusion was this market demonstrated a deficiency in the Corvair when 
all it really said was the car's handling could be changed for even more 
fun.

Given a choice, I'd hate to crunch a 928.  :-)

However (this is why I left the snippet way above) a stronger, stiffer, 
rigid shell is not what you really want around you in that situation. 
You want the metal to bend. When it bends it absorbs energy that you 
won't have to. You just don't care for it to bend all the way into your
private space.
