Howdy Phans,

While waiting for the wifey to choose which aquarium books she was going
to buy, I stumbled across an article in one of the automotive rags
(sorry, forgot which one) that indicated the reason for the precipitous
down turn in 928 valuation was due in part to body rigidity.  The
article indicated that due to the fact that 928s have a high aluminum
content, that they are prone to loose about 10+% of their rigidity in
about 5 years.  This leads to rattles and other annoyances that have an
overall downward affect on the value of the car.   What do y'all think?
My car rattles on occasion ('79) but not excessively; and not anything
like my friends '82 Corvette!  

Is our car prone to more rattling over time than any other sports car?
My previous four 944s were all rattle traps.  Their main problem
centered around the rear hatch area.  I don't get the same impression
from my 928 and its 9 years older than any 944 I've ever owned.  My 928
dash used to rattle but doesn't anymore now that I've redone the
interior. 

What are your experiences?

Have a good one,

Bert 
'79 928, 72K miles (doesn't really rattle, curious about how much its
worth now)
'90 Volvo 240DL (very quite car unlike most other tanks; unfortunately,
might be worth more than the 928)
.
