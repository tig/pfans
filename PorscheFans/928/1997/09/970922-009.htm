Patrick,

Congrats on your readiness to join us in 928 ownership.  It is an experience
to say the least.

They are tons of fun and very well built, though sometimes the things bolted
to them will break (A/C compressors, steering racks, water pumps, T-belts,
etc.)...needless to say those are the main things to have checked out.

As for the carpets...the front carpets by themselves are over $400 for the
set...that does not include the under seat, tunnel, rear passenger, rear
luggage area, or any other (door panel, tool kit) carpets in the car...you
could easily spend over $1000 on new carpets from the factory.  Now there are
used carpet alternatives as well as aftermarket alternatives.  I think you
should really stay w/ the original stuff however because it has a much richer
more luxurious (I know I spelled that wrong) feel to it.

Good luck w/ your quest for the ultimate driving machine, and don't settle
for anything less than the best.
