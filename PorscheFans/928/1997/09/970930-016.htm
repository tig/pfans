Subject: Warning: Magic Blower Syndrome is Contagious

 Which one of the 928 owners that showed up at the VA Frenzy had "Magic Blo=
wer
Syndrome"?
Who ever it was must have parked next to my newly restored 79 because now i=
t has
that dreaded disease. ;-(  .
There must be a 24hr incubation period because it started the "old max fan =
trick
for no reason" the very next day.

In all of the posts that I saw concerning the Magic Blower Syndrome no one
mentioned it was contagious, thanks guys.;o)
 Had I known that I would have gotten it vaccinated before the trip.

Oh well, I guess it is time to change that resistor pack.

Dave,

Before you go and change your resistor pack, the question is, how often doe=
s your blower jump to high speed?

Here's why I ask - I replaced both my resistor pack and my blower motor abo=
ut a month ago because I had the magic blower syndrome real bad.  Then, smo=
ke and burning smell, and several of the speeds didn't work.  The motor was=
 also noisy (had a bad bearing).  If you remember, I posted a procedure on =
how to change the resistor block.  Well, anyway, that cured all my problems=
, for a while.  I've noticed that the Magic blower syndrome is back, only v=
ery quickly, and just once in a while. (the other problems have stayed fixe=
d.)

My point is, that if it's only happening once in a while, I think that mayb=
e that's how it's supposed to work.  If the resistors get too hot, the ther=
moswitch kicks the fan up to high speed to cool it off (?).   If it's happe=
ning a lot, then you may have a problem.
