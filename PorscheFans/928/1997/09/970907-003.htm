Brian,

Hey...now I know you are not above a little stop light racing...you said one
time that you were beating GSXR's and CBR's in your 930...while that might be
the case it also might be the case that the riders sucked...NO Porsche
produced to date is going to take a moderately well ridden sport bike off the
line...I am sorry but there are no Porsche's that will 0-60 in less than 3.5
seconds.  At least no stock Porsche's that will do that.

Now Pat's 500+ lb/ft torque Chevy motored car might take some of them.  Also
Pat...are you sure this was not some whimpy dude in the NSX?  Every car mag I
have ever read says the NSX handles like an F1 car for the street...I will
have to look for this guy and really put him to shame in my S4.  BTW thanks
for your help w/ the kickdown switch.  We do need to check and see if we can
determine why I am still not getting a double kick down at highway speed.

As for the "if Porsche wanted to build Indy cars" comment from Brian...maybe
you are to young to remember...they did try and build their own Indy car
compleletly from the gound up...they gave up after half the season because it
SUCKED!!  Now I agree that if they had thrown more money at the project they
could have made it work, but they just gave up.  I think they realized that
it was not the kind of competition that they needed to sell their cars.

Anyway...just adding a little to the fire here.

Take it easy guys!
