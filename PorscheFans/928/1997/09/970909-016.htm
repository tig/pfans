I would start by verifying that the fuel and ignition system is working
properly.  Fuel pressure OK?  Clogged fuel filter?  Bad fuel regulator?

The ignition system: getting sparks, wires OK?  etc.. If you have
eliminated these two system, then you're in a better position to attack
the core of the problem(s).  Hope this help!
