This is _such_ a great observation. As some of you may know, I'm an avid
(OK, insane/sadistic/obsessive) mountainbiker. I never carry my bike to
any local riding trails in anything but my Nissan Sentra because the parking
areas are unpaved, rocky, dusty, muffler chewing, spoiler munching pits.
So, every Tuesday and Thursday I commute in the SE-R and ride right after
work. On every other day that I drive a 928, all of the other commuters 
within sight seem to assume a very passive attitude. In the SE-R, however,
I go unnoticed and everybody around seems to have "hot-shoe" syndrome. 
Because I drive the same route at the same time, I see many of the same people
in the same cars everytime and, based on what I drive, they morph before my
eyes!
