Since my last comment was good for so much discussion, here's another:

Everyone here is concerned about the value of their cars, which have
dropped at a far faster rate than other Porsches.

And yet, when a particular car comes along as an example of higher pricing,
people rush to trash the price as excessive.

Stepping back, what other 1984 car could you buy for $12-14K that would
give as much pleasure and value as a 928? What other $12-14K car of any
year or make would give as much pleasure and value?

OTOH, Jim goes on to talk about the (potentially) thousands of dollars in
maintenance and updates that a 928 of this vintage potentially needs...

So here's the question: is the current low market pricing on 928s fair?

BTW: I also would recommend the prospective owner save up for an '85/'86 or
87 928, at the current depressed market prices...
