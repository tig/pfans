>> Alright, 240 HP. Still more than the US model's 219 HP, and still unable
 to take a late model six-cylinder Mustang at the lights. I suspect this
 will result in copious amounts of catterwalling and whining...flame on
 people, flame on... 

Well, it seams each and every one of us has a slightly different
justification for owning a 928. For some it's the power, for others it's the
prestige/show effect, for some (like me) it's the pure beauty of the car,... 

I for one couldn't care less, whether the car has 219 or 316 HP - I would
enjoy it either way. I even admit that I liked the ride of the early 928s
better than the harsch ride of my S4. The reason why I ended up buying an S4
was because I could never find an older 928 that was in good shape AND in an
acceptable color combination, and because my friend at the factory
recommended that the extra money would be well spent on an S4 or newer
model...

Whatever reasons people have to own and drive a 928 doesn't matter much to
me. I'm happy to see the cars preserved and well cared for, even if I might
not agree with some of the things other owners do with or to them. 

And for those (flamers) who get a serious ego problem when being outperformed
by another car: You might consider seeing a Psychologist - it's cheaper than
most engine upgrades for the 928... ;-)
