  My first guess would be to check the various heat shields and the
  underbelly pan just below the radiator.  The underbelly pan is rather
  flimsy, and if it were banged by something, it might have deformed enough
  to be rubbing another component.  There are approx six heat shields
  around the exhaust system (at least on my '83) - two that sit horizontally
  below the exhaust manifolds at the rear of the engine, two that attach
  to the body just to the outside edge of the exhaust manifold collector,
  one on the drivers side exhaust manifold collector, and one above the cat.
  
  Of course, when a diode fell off of my (Paris-Rhone) alternator, it also
  made a rattle; but a problem like that should be evident by the voltmeter
  and warning lights.
