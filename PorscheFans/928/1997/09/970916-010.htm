With all  the talk of cooling systems going on I think I should relate =
what happened to me in July.  I was a few miles north of Wilmington, =
Delaware heading north at about 85 mph.  The outside temperature when I =
passed through Washington was 105.  I had the AC on max and the heat =
gauge was running a little over normal but not up to the first white =
mark.  The car which has 96K on it was running smooth as grease.  =
Suddenly the heat gauge literally shot up into the red zone and smoke =
started pouring out of the AC vents.  I immediately pulled off  onto the =
shoulder but the engine died before I even rolled to a stop.

Lots of smoke, not steam, poured off the engine. At first I thought that =
the engine was on fire and naturally, I had moved my extinguisher to one =
of my other cars and had forgotten about it.  Fortunately, after a few =
minutes, the smoke died down.  Meanwhile, I was on my phone, to AAA and =
shortly a wrecker arrived.  The guy wanter to shove a hydraulic ram six =
inches high under my brand new front air dam.

I told him that I needed a flatbed and explained why.  His grandson =
arrived with one a short while later and I had to show him how to winch =
it up on the truck by putting wooden blocks under the front tires etc.  =
As he was winching it up he said; "Don't worry mister, we'll fix it up =
for you.  Does this one have the engine in the front or the back?"

As he said that, I was talking to my mechanic in Pompano Beach and after =
he stopped laughing he said, "Don't let them touch that car!  So I had =
it flatbedded eleven hundred miles back to Florida.  End result?  The =
spring in the pressure cap on the radiator broke and fell into the =
resevoir below.  The water pump immediately pumped all the water out of =
the radiator and the left hand cylinder head cracked and the gasket for =
same blew. The head had to be welded by an aircraft repair shop that =
does a lot of aluminum welding.

Two months later, I'm just getting the car back.  While the head was =
off, the mechanic discovered that one of the cam bearing caps had a hunk =
broken out of it around one of the screw holes.  A two dollar part =
right?  All the Porsche dealers in Florida said the the cap was made of =
unobtainium and could only be purchased as an integral part of an entire =
head assembly for approximately $1500.00.

So my mechanic had a local machine shop make a new one out of a block of =
aluminum for $150.00.  After driving 928s over three hundred thousand =
miles since 1978 I thought that I had experienced every thing that could =
happen to them.  I was wrong.  My advice?  All members of this group =
invest five dollars or whatever and replace your radiator caps.  Mine =
was obviously a ten  year old original.
