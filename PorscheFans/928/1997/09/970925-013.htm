Steve,

  Unless you're going to spend considerable money investing in some
  quality aftermarket rims (e.g. the forged rims sold by Devek), you
  would probably wise to stay with some stock Porsche rims with stock
  tire sizes.  The only 8x16 front rim that came on a 928 were the forged
  club sport type that were installed only on the '89 GT.  These are
  fairly rare and will probably cost a good bit.  The 8x16 rear S4
  rims will not fit on the front of a 928 due to improper offset.
  Another option to give some additional width is to use '90-91 GT
  wheels which are cast and are sized 7.5x16f and 9.0x16r.  I have these
  on my '83 and they fit with no problems (I don't have rear spacers).
  These will probably be easier to find and less expensive than the
  rims from an '89.  You would still run stock tire sizes of 225/50x16f 
  and 245/45x16r, but you could step up to BFG R1s to gain a tremendous
  amount of grip.
   
  As far as KC setup, I believe he uses progressive rate Weltmeisters
  with Koni Reds.  When I saw his car at parade in San Antonio, he was
  prepping his car for an auto-x by swapping out his street '89 GT rims
  for some forged units that looked similar to what I've seen in the Devek 
  catalog.  I haven't heard anyone say that KC has swapped out the front
  bar for a larger one, but the larger bars are available from Weltmeister
  and Devek.
  
  As far as tire pressures, auto-xing will require higher pressures than
  track events.  For auto-xing, the best trick is to mark your tires with
  shoe polish in a few places around the circumference and increase pressures
  until the tire is not rolling over past the small triangles that you'll
  see on your tires where the tread and sidewall meet.
  
  Look at www.928s4vr.com in the performance mods section to read about
  the kickdown switch for autos.
  
  Hope this helps.
