Generally wait to see if the new person cares, and, if so, how that person
reacts. The word "Porsche" has many connotations (e.g., in LA, the joke
runs "Q: How is a Porsche different from a porcupine?  A: The pricks are on
the inside"), a lot of which have to do with politically-incorrect
extroversion, aggressive attitude, or plain old vulgar conspicuous
consumption.

Assuming the new person has any knowledge of Porsches, said person is fully
justified in assuming "911" until disabused of that notion, which brings up
a whole new layer of connotations (e.g., Turbo drivers mano a mano with the
great beast). Finally, if the new person has any awareness of 928s and is
positively inclined toward performance cars, you may have a new friend.

>manner?

Don't ask me; I've grown to enjoy being offensive, or at least plain spoken
(and am corrected by my friends and advisors when I deviate from the true
path).

>(like trying not to show your excitement when they are asking
>about something you REALLY enjoy)

Why not? Take a risk and bubble a bit; you might just elicit a real
response. If the new person is a heavy sports car person but unsure of
prevailing attitudes, that person may keep it under a bushel. If you get a
blank stare when you start talking about your prize toy, at least you found
out that this is not your common ground.

>Comments????

Take 'em for a ride; G-forces speak louder than words!
