NELSON LATHROP WROTE:

<I have mixed feelings about this.  The larger the surface, the more heat 
it
can dissipate, right?  So if you have a drilled rotor, you effectively
reduce the surface.  Having said that, I see those rotors used in some
race applications, I wonder if they are larger?  The look incredibly cool 
though.>

The holes drilled into vented rotors are for degassing the pad and rotor 
contact patch.  This does appear to have a significant effect when surface 
temperatures are above 600 f. with race pads.  I do not have any experience 
with softer road compounds and drilled rotors.  Also, the holes actually 
increase surface area, not decrease.  There is some argument, that in 
vehicles which have marginal brake mass (IE: rotor mass to absorb heat) 
that the drilling of the holes will degrade performance.  The 928 has 
sufficient brake mass.

As an aside, on the chassis rigidity issue ,  don't forget the windshield. 
 You will notice that it glued in with a structural urethane.  The glass is 
a stressed member on the 928 as it is in virtually all modern unibody 
construction vehicles today.
