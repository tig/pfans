It's probably worth replacing, since your heating/cooling system will
be a lot less responsive to the inside temperature if the fan is dead.
It's a little centrifugal blower, about 1.5 inches diameter. Of course
it's a pain to get to, but it just takes more patience than skill to do.

The reason I asked about it in the first place had to do with the magic
blower problem. I would expect the little fan to run with the fan speed
selector set to "0", but not with the bottom slider all the way to the
left (the rectangle). That slider position shuts off power to the
heating/cooling system, so if the fan were still running there, it
would mean that the control unit or the wiring were screwed up. Now
we can't tell, but my guess still goes to the resistor theory.
