<<I have taken a few speedos apart when this happens and there is a small
gear

that is driven by the odometer motor gear that looses some of its teeth or

breaks in half . I have yet figured out how to replace just the gear because
of

the way it is installed. In all cases I have just replaced the speedos with
good

used units.



Maybe someone out there has figured out how to replace that stupid gear with
out

messing up the rest of the unit and can enlighten us to the procedure..>>

I talked to a VDO repair center when I still lived in Portland, and they do
just replace the small gear only.  I don't know if they would give away any
secrets, but I would bet that some shop, somewhere, will tell you and at the
same time sell you the parts.  You just need to convince them that they
aren't loosing a customer (as in: you wouldn't pay them to do the job, rather
you would just replace the unit), and that they aren't gaining a competitor
(as in:  you set up shop doing VDO gear replacements).
