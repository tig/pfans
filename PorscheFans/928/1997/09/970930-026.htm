In this part of the world (Toronto) we have another word for a vehicle 
with the frontal attributes of the 928. Its called a snow plow. At least 
it would be if the rear end had any grip in deep white stuff. I don't 
believe I've ever seen a 928 being driven here in the dead of winter 
although a pal had to take his S4 to the dealer when there was a bit of 
ice around. His comment, in polite terms without the references to bodily 
functions, was that it scared him to death.
