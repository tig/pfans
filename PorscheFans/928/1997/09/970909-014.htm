Weight recommended by Porsche is 20W50.  Most people would agree that
synthetic is a better oil but it might be an overkill if you change your
oil every 3000 miles...

DO NOT USE ADDITIVE IN YOUR OIL!!!  Any additive that contain teflon is 
even worse.  Dupont, the original maker of teflon, recommend AGAINST
using
it in motor oil.  The stuff can decompose and produce hydrofluoric
acid...  
enough said.


> 3.  What should my oil pressure be at idle and warm? 

The pressure should be pegged at 5 bar until the engine is warm.  At
that point,
the pressure will go down to 2-3 bar at iddle and pegged at 5 bar at
about 3000 
rpm.

The 32 valve engine were introduce in the USA in 85 and the rest of the
world in
87.  Your 82, except if it had an engine translplant, would have a 16
valves engine.
The HP of the 32 valve engine were 288 in 85-86 and 316 in S4 models (87
and on)
