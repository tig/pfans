Ok Porshce 928 Institute members,

I am now pissed.  An old (maybe 6 year old) Mustang 5.0 got me today from  a
light... if I had a functioning kickdown that would not have been the case.
 I was able to handle it when a 928 buddy w/an '88 5spd (bone stock I sould
mention) was taking me off the line, but this is not happening!!  I have an
Autothority chip, and muffler by pass and this should not be happening.

This is what I need to know.  How can I check the Kickdown relay?  How can I
check to see exactly what it is supposed to be doing when it is working and
check to see if that is happening, and if it is how do a do adjustments to
get 2 gear kickdowns from moderate (ie. 55mph or so) speeds and how do I get
it to hold all gears to redline.

Patrick came over and fixed the button so that it was engaging the other day,
and we had a few runs that seemed to hold to the red line, but now it is not
doing it....Patrick, maybe we need to adjust that lever that engages the
switch too...

TIA,
James Morrison
