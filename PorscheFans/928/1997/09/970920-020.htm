I'M NEW AT THIS, SO PLEASE OVERLOOK SPELLING AND OTHER MINOR MISCUES.

I BOUGHT A '90 928 AUTO IN NOV'96, AND HAVEN'T PUT BUT ABOUT 1200 MILES
ON IT. I LIVE IN THE COUNTRY, AND HAVE JUST HAD THE ROAD PAVED TO THE
HIGHWAY IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS. GRAVEL ROADS AND 4.5" ROAD CLEARENCE
ARE NOT CONDUCIVE TO 'SPORTY' DRIVING. WHEN I GOT THE CAR I STARTED OUT
WITH AN OIL CHANGE, (ANOTHER STORY) THAT BEGAN WITH REMOVING THE BELLY
COVER FROM THE CAR. SEVERAL SCREWS WERE MISSING, PART OF THE FRONT MOUNT
WAS GONE, RIPPED OUT, AND HOLES IN THE FIBERGLASS VENTS. I SET ABOUT
REPAIRING THESE AND GOT IT BACK IN GOOD SHAPE AND REINSTALLED IT. AFTER
ONLY A FEW MILES SCREWS BEGAN DROPPING OUT, AND THE FRONT MOUNTS DROPPED
DOWN AND ANOTHER REPAIR JOB IN WORK. I'VE INCREASED SCREW SIZES,
INSTALLED PLASTIC ANCHORS TO HOLD THE SCREWS IF HOLES WERE TO LARGE,
ETC. I'M LEARY OF DRIVING THE THING ON SOME ROADS BECAUSE IT BOTTOMS OUT
AND SCRAP. WHERE I LIVE TEXAS HAS BEEN SLOW TO MAKE ROAD REPAIRS, AND
EACH TRIP OUT IS A LESSON IN ROAD RACING PLUS WORRING ABOUT THE BELLY
COVER GETTING FOLDED BACK AND CAUSING MANY PROBLEMS. I'VE TRIED SEVERAL
THINGS TO KEEP IT IN PLACE BUT IT'S TAKING A TOLL ON ME AND THE BELLY
COVER.

ANY ONE OUT THERE HAVE THIS PROBLEM, OR DID COMMON SENSE TAKE HOLD AND
JUST LEAVE IT OFF. I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS


MORE VEHICLES THAN I NEED!
'90 928
'93 ELDORADO
'80 280 ZX
'85 300 ZX
'88 2500 CHEVY
