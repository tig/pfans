No. This can indicate a clogged filter or some other persistent restriction
in oil flow, which is not a good thing. How long had it been since your
last oil change?

>IS THIS NORMAL?

Yes. Cold oil is more viscous, so it resists being pumped. Once it warms
up, it flows adequately with less pressure, but the oil pump works harder
as the engine speeds up, bringing pressure back up.

By the way, it is a good idea to wait for the oil pressure at low engine
speed to drop as described above before applying full throttle. You want to
be sure that oil flow is 100% so all the bearing surfaces are protected
under full load. Coolant temperature may rise to normal before the oil is
all warmed up, so check for both indications before going full blast.
