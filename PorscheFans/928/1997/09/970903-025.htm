  Hi all

  For anybody intersted in taking their 928 to the racetrack, here is an 
oportunity to find out just what you and your 928 can do without 
worring about getting a ticket.

  The BMW club is having a high performance driving school at Buttonwillow
Raceway (located near Bakersfield, California). These things usually fill
up real fast and therefore are limited to BMW cars. I signed up and got in
My wife is taking her BMW and I'm taking the 928,so thats how we got in. 

  Anyways, I just heard that the school didn't fill up and there are still
openings left. The format of the event is 2 days of track time. There are
4 groups and you take turns at 20 minute sessions. You will get an instructor
to go out with you the whole time, and you get 4 or 5 sessions per day. 

   The place: Buttonwillow Raceway (http://www.calclub.com/buttonwi.htm )

   Date : September 27, 28

   Sponsor: BMW club Golden Gate Chapter

   Cost : $275 + BMW club membership fee $30 

   Signups : contact BMW club (http://www.ggc-bmw-cca.org )
                               or call Jim Grinstead at (510) 837-4428

   Requirements: Helmet (Snell SA90 or later I think )
                 Previous track experince or safety school. You will have
                 to talk to Jim Grinstead to see if they can be flexible
                 if you've never been on the track before.

  Well hope to see some other 928s on the track, if not, I'll try to 
make a good showing with my 928 among all those BMWs.
