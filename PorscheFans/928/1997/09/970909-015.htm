I'm still looking for some help. Sometime ago I asked anyone if they have
experienced an irratic idle problem with their 928. Mine is a 86S. Once the
engine goes into the "closed loop" and runs for about 15/20 min. it begins to
cycle the idle. Goes from 300 to 1800 rpm and continues this. It also begins
running rich. If the engine dies, it will start right back up, idle fine for
about 2/3 min. and starts the cycle all over again. Purchased the new manuals
but they leave a lot to be desired and no one I have talked to has
experienced this problem. My throttle switch was full of oil so have that on
order. ANY help with this would be great. Havn't driven it for about 3 mo.
 HELP
