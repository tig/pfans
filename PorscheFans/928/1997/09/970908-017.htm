I've experienced this problem before, and here's my standard
email about it.  Mine is a 911, but I think the mechanism is
the same:

The cruise control in my '87 911 used to bleed off speed by about 0.5
mph/mile.
It seemed like a vacuum leak type of thing, but the CC is not a vacuum
type of
system.  Well, the actuator is, but the control mechanism is not. 
Unable to
trace the problem to any obvious source, I eventually replaced the CC
brain.
Works great now.
 
I've heard about this same thing from a few other Carrera owners.  The
CC
system may be the same in the 928.  In fact, the CC box has a 928.xxx.
prefix
for the porsche part number stamped on it.
 
The CC brain is VDO manufactured electronics package.  It's in an
aluminum
casing, about the size of small paperback book, and mounted under the
radio in the passenger compartment. A new one lists for $600.  I called
around bone yards and found a salvage from Parts Heaven for $125.  I
wanted to repair the one I have, (I suspect a bad transistor or
something)
but I cannot get an electrical schematic.  I also cannot find anyone who
will repair VDO electronics.

Keep Porsching,
