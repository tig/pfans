Thanks David,

Found the rubber flap thingamajig ---- yes it did have leaves and debris in
there ----
cleaned it out. Also removed K & N filter (performance gain is negligible, if
any) and replaced with new paper filter. And no response from them also tells
me that they, in effect, don't have an answer they want us to hear.

Regards,
Greg Schickel
