The following is paraphrased from the Northeast Region newsletter:

For the sixth consecutive year, the Northeast Region of the PCA will
hold its annual 928 tech session, with Ed Almeida of European
Performance Engineering, in Natick, Massachusetts (about fifteen miles
west of Boston). As in previous years, they ask for questions in
advance from participants, to help start the discussion. In
previous years, participants have come from as far away as 
southern Connecticut and the wilds of Maine. The date is Sunday,
October 19, and the deadline for registration is October 12.
There will be morning beverages and snacks, plus a complimentary
lunch for all participants, in addition to the opportunity to
meet and talk shop with fellow V-8 fans. Any questions, call
Steve Ross at 508-655-4249, or email him at SLR944@aol.com.
The price is just five dollars per entrant.

Looks to me as if this is a good opportunity for those of us
in this corner of the country to get together. Not quite the
magnitude of the Shark Frenzy, but a good opportunity to learn
something about our cars and each other. There's a registration 
form in the magazine, which asks for the following information;
I assume that any old piece of paper with the requested info
would do:

Name; Address; City/State/Zip; Phone(eve); Phone(day).
Number of entries times $5 each = $___ enclosed.
Mail entry to Steve Ross, 49 Brook Village Lane, Natick MA 01760.
Checks payable to NER/PCA.
Include any questions you would like answered/discussed.

Hope to see a lot of you there.
