  Having grown up in Baltimore and contributed more than my fair share
  to Md.'s traffic control slush funds, here are a few that I'm aware of:
  
    I-95 - as you get close to I-495, the potential for a sting increases
           dramatically.  From Rt 175 southward, pay particular attention
           for State Troopers hanging out around bridge abutments.  As a 
           general rule, stay out of the left lane and try to blend in with 
           traffic in one of the other three lanes.
           
    I-70 - just west of Frederick and the I-270 split, I've seen (and fell
           victim to) laser traps.  Those coming from the west will be
           descending a long hill before exiting I-70 to get on I-270 and
           it is very easy to get up too much speed on that stretch.
           
    I-95 - north of Balto., just before the Delaware line.  I've never
           failed to see the cops try to snag people as they head out of
           Md..
           
    I-695 (Balto. beltway) & I-70 interchange.  There is a State Police
          barracks near this interchange.  They used to use a camera on
          top of the I-70 bridge to watch I-695 traffic.  Don't know if
          it's still active.
          
    BW-Parkway - just don't speed on this road.  It's only 2 lanes wide 
          and with all of the gov't agencies along the route, it is heavily
          monitored.  I-95 is a better alternative.
          
    Maryland cops use the whole gamut of speed detection devices, including
    spotter planes.  I spent my whole driving career there with my license
    one point shy of having my hand slapped by a judge.  Moved to Texas
    and have had only one ticket in ten years.  Go figure...
