I don't know if you other fans are smiling when you drive, but my face
hurts all the time.

The other day my wife and I needed to get somewhere in a hurry so we took
the 928.  Where we live there are lots of windy roads with short passing
areas.  The PO put some wonderful sounding stainless steal muffler system
on the car and at certain resonant frequencies sounds like an F-18 @
afterburner stage 6!!  We coasted up to an Audi A4 (nice car, not a 928) at
40~ mph (remember I'm on a mission) and man when that yellow line broke I
engaged the ole kickdown switch.  The guy swerved and almost went off the
road (he would have if it wasn't for the vacuum I created), my wife's head
was moulded into the head rest, CDs were flying (unmistakably surreal) and
the car sounded like Dante's Inferno incarnate.  The best part of this was
watching his expression in HIS rearview mirror and then me watching him
disappear in mine.  I look at my wife and say "Porsche, there is no
substitute" and she starts laughing.  God I love this car!!!!!!!!!!!
