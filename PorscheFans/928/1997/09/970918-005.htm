Please forgive just a little bandwidth here to ooze a little exhuberance
over getting my 928 out of the body shop and into the garage to be
reassembled.

I've had it for two days now, and checked all vacuum motors (engine not
installed yet) for climate control, removed most vacuum lines in engine
compartment, installed the rubber weatherstips around lip of hatch and
doors, removed dash, and installed headlight assemblies.  I was on it
until midnight last night, primarily due to difficulty removing and
reinstalliing that damned blower motor - GEESH - what an ordeal.  So
much sweat was dripping from my brow and chin it practically washed out
that area in there accessed by the little rubber mouse door on the
firewall.  I decided to completely remove the windshield washer
reservoir to clean it and check the electricals.  PO(s) repair of
inoperative ww pump was to cut the wires, buy a $12 Anco universal unit
from Pep Boys, and wire nut it into place.  It literally crumbled apart
in my hand as I was loosening the wire nuts.  You can guess what repairs
I'm facing with that kind of previous maintenace.

I'm not complaining......knew what the deal was when I bought it.   As
soon as practical, it will be mobile again and Mr. Tong will get a
photo.   ........gorgeous Petrol Blau Metallic......

A reason for the email was also to let you all know how much help you've
been since stumbling in here about six weeks ago.  The experiences
you've had and conversations in here have already greatly helped me and
will continue to help me as the car gets put back together.

Thanks to all........will keep you posted.
