Just bought a 1985 928S and had to drive it back from Hilton Head, SC home to Seattle.  Needless to say this trip was
a lot more enjoyable than when previously done in a 1985 Chevy Celebrity.  Anyway, the subject here is 
oil change considering I now need one.  I have been hearing arguments from different sides as to 
what type of oil to maintain within the vehicle - synthetic or regular.  I fly each week to the east coast
for work and will only drive the vehicle on weekends and sometimes not for a few weeks at a time.  It seems to me
this might be an argument for synthetic given the infrequency of my driving.  I imagine this is probably the same with most
928 owners (not the commute but the limited driving).  Any thoughts?
