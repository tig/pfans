  I was concerned about introducing an unknown variable into the scope of
  the problem.  E.g. what if the catalyst material in the universal cat
  creates an exhaust output that is slightly cleaner or slightly dirtier
  than the OEM cat - would you still be able to tune the FI system according
  to factory specs when testing with a CO/HC probe or would you end up
  throwing off the FI system?  If your original cat had a test probe port,
  would the universal provide that (assuming it was used for FI adjustment on 
  the K-Jetronic cars).
  
  I am not an expert on catalytic converters.  I only know from past
  experience, and advise that I've received, that the 928 is a higly tuned
  "system".  If you change one parameter in that system, you need to be
  able to compensate by adjusting other parameters.  I've faced problems
  with my car - courtesy of the PO - and I've had to spend time getting
  everything back to a factory baseline in order to diagnose the problems.
  That was the thought that came to mind when you mentioned a universal cat.
