I just found out that I have the adjustable struts on my 90 S4.  Does
anyone know the specs for the factory settings on height?  The tail end
is sitting a bit low, but that could be attributed to the 7 year old
stock Boge struts, which are due to be replaced in the near future.
Which brings me to another question.  The factory Boge strut replacement
cost is $320, and the Bilstien set is $700!  Both prices are all four.
Since I have access to a shop with a lift, the labor is not an issue.  I
don't push the car all that hard, I just have this thing about being in
a four wheel drift when a surprise comes around the curve!  I probably
won't ever put the car on the track, as I have no desire to find a wall
with my beautiful S4! Not to mention, my insurance will cancel me if
they find out.  They don't  care if it is a driving school, unless it is
state or college sponsored.  Anyway back to my question? Are the
Bilstiens really worth more than twice the cost of the factory Boges?

There are two PCV hoses that originate on the passenger side valve
cover,and go to the dome under the intake.  You can see both of them by
peeking over the thermostat housing.  The question I have is, on the 90
S4 motor, can you just remove the thermostat housing?(in front of the
intake) It covers the whole width of the engine between the heads. Or do
you have to remove the intake also/instead?
