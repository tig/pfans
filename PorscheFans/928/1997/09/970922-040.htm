 They are reliable and very well built, but even routine maintenance can be
very expensive. 

I tend to agree with that. My top ten list was meant to show ways to keep
cost under control, not so much to promote affordability. It's easy to get
carried away with these cars, and throw more money at them than necessary.
Yes, you ALWAYS need serious money on the side - especially if it's your
daily driver. But also keep in mind that these cars have a low percentage
depreciation these days - very much in contrast to other, newer and often
smaller cars in the same price range.

>> An easier way to save money on insurance is to have it listed as a limited
usage/pleasure vehicle.

My car is insured for about 7k of Californian pleasure miles per year - and
to add the collission would have added close to $ 600 in 6 months - or 1200
per year. Now comes the simple math: If someone pays this for the 50 years
he/she might drive in his/her life, it totals to $ 60k. For that money I
could total 3+ cars of a value equivalent to my 928. Is it likely that I
would total 3 or more cars in that time? (I'd probably be dead after the
first or second...)

I've been driving for over 15 years without causing any accident, or major
damage (a $ 200 dent was all by now). I have learned to anticipate some of
the dumbest possible behavior of others on the road, be alert, keep distance,
and generally drive quick but rather defensively. (And believe it or not: I
still have fun!!!)

I could get insurance for any possible hazard that can hit me, my car, house,
and whatever else I have. But the one most happy with this would be my
insurance agent. I decided to take some risks in life and responsibility for
those of my actions that I have control over. That doesn't mean I'm not
insured, but I select carefully what I get insurance for. 

In case of my cars I feel I have some control over the likelyhood of crashing
them, making me believe that liability, uninsured motorist, and comprehensive
cover enough of the hazards I can't control. 

So far this has worked well for me, and saved me a lot of money over the
years. I am not recommending this "philosophy" for everyone - rather see it
as a suggestion to think about...
