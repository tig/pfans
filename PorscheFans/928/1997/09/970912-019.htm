<<And yet, when a particular car comes along as an example of higher pricing,

people rush to trash the price as excessive.



Stepping back, what other 1984 car could you buy for $12-14K that would

give as much pleasure and value as a 928? What other $12-14K car of any

year or make would give as much pleasure and value?>>

You asked if current 928 prices are fair ... Well, fair to whom?  The buyer?
 The seller?  The 928's haven't been holding their value very well not b/c
there are too many of them, but b/c they have never really been exactly what
the average American buyer with a lot of money has wanted.  All of us can
drive the 928 market back up by paying $5-6K over current market value for
our next 928, but why?  Do you go to a new car dealer and tell him that you
will buy his car only if he will accept an extra $5,000 for it?  I would say
that most people (including myself) trashed this particular example of higher
pricing simply because the car was not an example of higher pricing, it was
an example that was over priced (by a dealer if I remember correctly).  Why
buy an 84 928 with 105K miles for $14,995 when you can buy a white 1988 928S4
with 62K miles for $15,000 (which I just sold yesterday)?  It may be along
time before the prices of 928's begin to rise, but why not take advantage of
the present and grab a couple?  Be thankful!  If my 87 S4 held it's value as
well as my 930 it would have cost me around $65,000 to buy it back when I did
(1990).  It's just sad that a $70,000 car is only worth mid teens today.
 Anyway - hope this bit of nonsense helps!
