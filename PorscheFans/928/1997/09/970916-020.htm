Please, we're starting to sound like 911'ers! ;-)


Here. Have a laugh:


A yuppie opened the door of his 911, when suddenly a car came  along
and hit the door, ripping it off completely. When the police arrived
at the scene, the yuppie was complaining bitterly about the damage to
his precious 911. "Officer, look what they've done to my Porsche!!!"
he whined.

"You yuppies are so materialistic, you make me sick!!!" retorted the
officer, "You're so worried about your stupid Porsche that you didn't
even notice that your left arm was ripped off!!!"  Oh my gaaad...",
replied the yuppie, finally noticing the bloody left shoulder where
his arm once was,

"Where's my Rolex!!!!!"
