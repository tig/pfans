Start by flushing the system....it's dirt cheap, and very easy to do
(left front of car,
knurled knob over about a quart-sized container) and if it's a clogging
problem, 
you'll know soon enough.

The factory manuals are very good in general....I got a set from 928
Intl.  Mark
there is very knowledgable, and very helpful too if you're having
trouble interpreting
the manual.  928 Int'l is a fount of both parts AND knowledge!

Trans lube choice is very important.  You want a GL-5 (not a GL-4 like
most transmissions), higher extreme pressure protection I believe.  Next
trick is getting something that's not TOO slippery (that slays
synchros!).

Red Line makes a 75W90NS (the NS is very important: = "not slippery")
that's ideal.  Doesn't run off the surfaces, relatively unaffected by
cold and
heat, and tremendous film strength (avoid those metal-to-metal contact
horrors).

Then I'm not the only nutcase out there that thinks that pattern was
cool...
