I (honestly) have heard good things about using peanut butter to remove wax 
from various unsightly places.  Just wipe on a little bit, let it sit for a 
second and then wipe it off.  You really do need to try to get the wax off 
of the wing before you use "Back to Black" or "Black Again" or any other 
type of product like that.  And do also get all the peanut butter off, 
unless you want to look like the Pied Piper of squirrels and various wild 
birds as you drive around town.  Super Clean may work, but be very careful 
as I have seen such products turn rubber hoses and trim in the engine 
compartment a chalky white color.  Not to mention the fact that it isn't 
very paint friendly.  Try the peanut butter, then throw on some pork chops, 
wait ... wrong recipe.  Seriously though, try that and if that doesn't work 
put some Bug & Tar remover on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it won't 
react badly with the black (it shouldn't).  If these two don't work then I 
would have a few choice words for whoever you had detail your car, some of 
which would be "are you paying for my new spoiler with a check or cash?" 
 Let me know what happens.

Brian, and of course David and Tom,

Thanks much for the suggestions, I will try them as soon as I can get to 
the store and purchase a gallon of peanut butter.  (Smooth, of 
course).(There is some concern on this, however, read below.)

However,  I feel that you, Brian,  may well have come upon a major 
performance improvement.  I am quite sure that everyone on the 928 list has 
read and therein hold close to heart "Theory of Wing Sections" by Abbott 
and Doenhoff.  In this tome, there is a section which deals with surface 
configuration and coefficients of friction of the materials of 
construction.  As we all know, the rear wing (S4 and later) is a typical 
inverted airfoil.  This airfoil produces lift (downforce in our case) by 
the simple method of speed of the airflow over the respective surfaces. 
(read: Bernoulli)  The top or "flat portion" has little effect of the 
airflow and pressure.  However, the lower curved section has a pronounced 
effect in that it accelerates the air flow, therein reducing the pressure 
on this side of the airfoil.  I.E. DOWNFORCE.

The point of this is quite simple:  Peanut butter has a very high 
coefficient of friction. (At least it does in my mouth).  Whereas, your 
normal jelly has a very low coefficient of friction.(in as new condition) 
 Therefore, if one were to coat the top (or Flat side of the wing) with 
Peanut butter and the lower curved part with Jelly, the differentials in 
pressure would be enhanced. Ergo, more downforce.

It would seem an interesting discussion for all of us as to the variations 
inherent in the different brands of both Peanut butter and Jelly and the 
actual effects these may have upon lap times at your favorite circuit. 
 There are many technical problems that will have to be dealt with however. 
 Solubility is tantamount.  Just as you must choose a good rain tire, would 
you than have to choose a different brand of Peanut butter and jelly for 
the track conditions.  I can see the engineering difficulties and therein 
escalating costs of competition rearing its ugly head.  Bernie Eccelstone 
will  make money somehow by bringing this technology to F!.

It is always this way when technology becomes involved in motor racing.

Of course, there would be the benefit of having your trackside lunch 
available.  (just bring bread)

I invite comments and suggestions relative to the recommended PB&J 
compounds for wing treatment.  Possibly a track by track setup procedure 
could be developed and put in the FAQ section.

Thank you all for your suggestions relative to the "black" problem.

As always, enjoy your ride,
