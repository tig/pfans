Morten:

Thanks for the nice story! I'm glad to hear you enjoyed your factory tour!

If you allow me a little correction: 

Porsche does outsource the pressing of body panels, but the bodies are
assembled in the modern body assembly plant accross the street from the
assembly lines. The bodys are then transported over the street through a
transportation system (kind of like an enclosed bridge that high over the
street connects body assembly and assembly lines). This was a major
investment for Porsche a couple of years back, and part of the reason why the
968 was made in Stuttgart, rather than by Audi in Neckarsulm as the 924/944s
were.

I have seen road testing of new cars from the assembly, but do they drive 1-2
hours per car? I used to see them hit the (speed limited) A81 outside of
Zuffenhausen, and take the next exit already. Driving them for an hour or two
would put quite a few miles on the odo. Anybody observed these on new
Porsches? 

I also wonder, how they do this in Finland in the winter time...

Unfortunately, many people who visit the factory don't get to see more than
the museum. At times, there are too many visitors for the tours, so it is a
good idea to make a reservation in advance. There used to be two direct phone
numbers to make reservations: +49-711-911-5985 and -5484.

Not too many US buyers seem take advantage of the factory delivery program
these days. I get the impression that the dealers just don't tell their
customers about it - for whatever shallow reasons. Or is it limited to buyers
(excluding Leasing customers)? However, taking advantage of the program,
buyers save enough cost to pay for the trip to Germany, they get to drive
their car on the Autobahn (ganz schnell), and get the car shipped and
delivered to their local dealer afterwards.

Porsche also offers an intensive full-day combination tour including the
Zuffenhausen factory and the Weissach engineering center. The Weissach part
includes a high speed ride in a Porsche racecar on their test grounds. This
tour can be booked undner "Porsche Backstage" though the Porsche Travel Club
(+49-711-911-7151, Fax - 6095). Cost, including meals and transfers is around
$300. 

Most of the Porsche Accessories you have seen were designed by one of
Ferdinand Porsche's sons, who runs his design company "Porsche Design" in
Zell am See (Austria), pretty close to the "Porsche" Hotel, and the "Porsche"
VW dealership. None of these, are in any way linked to the car factory.
However, Porsche Design and the "Porsche Hof" Hotel cater to the same
crowd...

Have you had a closer look at these used 928GTS? I believe most of them are
executive cars, some of which have really fancy options from the "Exclusive"
program, such as specialty leather interiors, wood trims,...
