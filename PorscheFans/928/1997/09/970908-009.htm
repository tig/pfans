I personally think Automobile is the worst of the car rags. (yes, worse
than Motor Trend!!!)

The publisher is a former ad guy for Chevrolet, and I have seen him all but
walk over people to kiss the posterior of the nearest Chevrolet engineer.

There are several automotive journalists who need to be euthanized, IMHO,
because they have read their own press releases too many times, and now
believe them. David E. Davis is one, Brock Yates another.

However, tantrum aside, the 928 is not  a rigid car. Even for its time, it
could not compare with a 911 or any number of other high performance
automobiles.

The 928, for all its wonderfulness (and I've owned four, so I truly love
'em) is a car that needed a few more years of development. The balance
between the basic design concept of front V8, rear transaxle was ill served
by Porsche's efforts to remove weight. I've been associated with a couple
of different companies trying to improve chassis stiffness in these cars,
and it can be done at the cost of only about 100 lbs. of steel.

One comment I remember from 928 International was that when they cut the
roof off, the chassis visibly 'relaxed'. And that was on a lift(!) And
with hundreds of pounds of weight already removed(!) This is not the
behavior of a rigid car.

As for the chassis 'loosening over time', what car doesn't?
