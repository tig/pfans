JD,

Welcome...I am kind of the ad hoc head of the 928 group in Austin and we are
a very active group here in town.  We do many things and have a blast doing
them.  We are way more active than the PCA members at large, and look forward
to the day when we can welcome you and your new car to functions (you are
welcome to come w/o a 928, but it is more fun if you have your own to talk
about).

As for things to look for in a car this age (I have an '88 and my best friend
Elliott has an '88 5spd, so I feel qualified) is drying out of verious rubber
gaskets and the leaks that ensue.  What to look for is complete service
records...and the things to look for are:  A/C work (all the gaskets and
usually a compressor by this time), steering rack leaks, Timing belt and
water pump are a must every 30k miles (and if the water pump has not yet been
done then it is probably leaking anyway), head gaskets and cam gaskets (more
the cam than the head), and if I think of anything else I will let you know.

Look forward to meeting you soon.
