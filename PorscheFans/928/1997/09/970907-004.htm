  Jim,  my 85 car as an antenna amplifier located under the dash but I
do not have
a roof antenna.  In 85 the antenna was located in the windshield.
Originaly,
I had very poor reception on my radio.  This was caused by the previous
owner
disconnecting the power supply to the antenna booster.  If your radio
has been
removed or "improved" you might have suffered the same fate.

As I do not have any experience with your model year, I will "bounce"
your message
to the 928 porschefans list.  With over 500 members, someone should be
able to give
you a better answer.  I strongly suggest that you try the list for a
while, especially if
you are inclined at repairing your 928 on your own.  to join, follow the
link to:

For the list member, please answer Jim directly until he as joined our
rank.
