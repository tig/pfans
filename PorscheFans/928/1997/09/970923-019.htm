The stuff you have added to your car sounds like it might well be 
Molybdenum Disulfide. This is an additive that has been around for 
decades. I have used it in many different types of engines. The main 
claim to fame of this compound is that its slippery as heck. I've also 
added it to a transmission or two (manual of course) and it has generally 
had good to very good results there as well. Its not the same thing as 
PTFE/ Teflon of course so the arguments about breaking down don't apply 
as far as I know. On that subject, I do seem to remember from my avionics 
days in the 70's that there was a warning about machining PTFE. If very 
high temperatures were achieved it would give of a nasty gas. I think it 
was phosgene or something like that. It was told to me that it was more 
or less the same stuff as mustard gas and I know that stuff was real 
nasty and turned to acid in the lungs of any poor soul who breathed it 
in. So the acid breakdown issue sounds plausible I guess. The only 
question is the temperature required to do it. As I remember it was a lot 
higher than is likely to be achieved in suspension in the oil. Anyone own 
a teflon coated fry pan?
