Hi, I'm new to this list, and have been following this "magic blower" threa=
d closely, as I've just had the same problem.  However, I had something els=
e happen.  On a trip back from Florida we got stuck in traffic on 95, and a=
s we sat there sweating (our AC wasn't working - that's another story) I wa=
s running the blower just to get some air moving.  All of a sudden smoke st=
arted to pour out of the vents.  We thought "Oh #*$%!", the car's on fire! =
 I recognized an electrical type of smell though, and immediately turned of=
f the blower.  The smoke was gone in a minute or two, and the car seemed to=
 be running fine, so I concluded that the blower motor had burned out.  Nee=
dless to say, I didn't touch the switch again.

Well, a couple of weeks went by, and I was figuring that I'd have to replac=
e the blower when I got around to it.  One day I thought I'd try it again, =
and found that on the highest speed setting it worked!  All the other speed=
s were dead.  Obviously, the motor itself was OK.

I talked to a local Porsche repair shop about it, and the mechanic, who I t=
hink is pretty good, said, "It's the resistor pack."  Then he asked me if t=
he blower had been jumping to high speed now and then for no apparent reaso=
n, and of course it had (the magic blower syndrome).  He said that that's a=
 sign that it's getting ready to go. (?)  Well, I've replaced the resistor =
block and the blower (had a bad bearing anyway, and was noisy.  While it's =
apart...) and it has been working OK so far.  It's only been about a week t=
hough...

Oh, by the way, there are four wire coils on this resistor block, of varyin=
g resistance.  One of them on mine was visually burned out and broken.  Tha=
t's where the smoke had come from.
