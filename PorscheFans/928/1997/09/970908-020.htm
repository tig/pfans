It may be different on other cars, but on my 82 I've recently found that on
some occasions neither of the windows (or the sunroof, for that matter)
will work; the problem appears to be in the ignition switch, because with
the car still running if I move the key very slightly towards the "off"
position the windows & sunroof start to work again.  You may want to try
moving your key back slightly just to see if you have the same problem.
Hopefully mine won't get any worse, particularly since I think I blew a
hole in my catalytic converter yesterday :(  (Any suggestions?????)

Ok,

First off, thanks for all the help all of you have provided for my
questions in the past.  The car is coming along slowly but surely.  I
have put over 3000 miles of my own now and am getting very used to
driving it :-)

Here's the latest little annoyance.  My drivers window now works only
intermittantly.  I wouldn't think any of you would be able to help me
as intermittant problems are a bear to troubleshoot, but I discovered
a consistancy that may be just the clue needed.

Each time I turn on the car now I check to see if the window works.
Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  Here's the cool part.  As
long as the car is on it either ALWAYS works or ALWAYS doesn't.  This
leads me to believe it's not a short in the wiring but maybe some
other problem.  Does anyone know enough about the relays and such to
figure this one out?

Thanks in advance.
