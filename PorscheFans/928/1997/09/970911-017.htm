Following is a copy of an email I snet to a fellow Porsche driver regarding 
my recent transmission problems. Thought it might be appreciated by the 928 
group. By the way, you gotta have a sense of humor about these things, 
right?

Gary, Got a new one for you and having recently done the tranny thing, you 
may appreciate it.

Last week I noticed a large stain on my driveway, wetted my finger and 
tasted, definitely coolant tasting, but it didn't ever dry (which I 
attributed to water wetter which I recently began using). I checked the 
resevoir and it was full, so i thought expansion, no problem. First time I 
drive it after noticing the stain the car began to shudder as it went into 
gear and shifted a little hard.

I immediately drove back home and got underneath to check the ATF resevoir. 
I couldn't see any fluid in the resevoir at all. Reached under and removed 
the cap, stuck my finger in to feel if there was any there, yes there was, 
but it was not visible because it was the color of pepto-bismol, literally.

The transmission cooler inside the radiator had split and pumped coolant 
into the tranny and when I turned the car off, it would pump ATF into the 
radiator causing it to overfill and drain. BAD. BAD, BAD.

Long story even longer. Remanufactured radiator, rebuilt tranny. $1,740 to 
fix or own a really expensive trot line weight. We fixed.

The silver lining(s).
1. Radiator needed to be flushed anyway (but not with ATF).
2. Good time to replace all the worn v-belts and leaking tranny hose.
3. Reman radiator $350, new $1,395.
4. Rebuild tranny with all new "soft" parts, $1,400. New, who knows?
5. Guys at Benzin are fastastic. Invited me in to see all of the parts and 
problems. And I mean, they are FAST. The car was towed by AAA to them late 
Monday morning. 1 day for diagnostic. 1 day to get a reply from me (I was in 
Houston on business). 1 day to get radiator and tranny parts. Ready tomorrow 
morning.

Well, see you this weekend , but don't think I'll autocross on Sunday, I 
want to make sure everything is running smoothly with the recent work. I'll 
probably just work the start or course. Later.
