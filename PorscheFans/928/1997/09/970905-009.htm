Have you tried replacing the lambda sensor with one that is known to be
good? How about the cold start valve? These are the first things to check

Is your car modified in any way?

One of the things people often do to early 928s is open up the exhaust
system. When they do so, it reduces the back pressure that the lambda
sensor needs to reach operating temperature (later sensors solved this
problem by pre-heating themselves). Without a lambda sensor, the system
needs to be manuually adjusted for low-RPM emissions.

The catalytic converters do have a service life, and yours may well be
dead--especially if somebody used leaded gas at some point. But it Porsches
run pretty clean when everything is right, so it sounds to me as if you
have a problem with more than one cause.

Any other mechanics you can go to for a second opinion?
