<<Well, this might be a stupid question but I am planning to drive

to the Frenzy from Missouri.  I guess I can either through the

64 or the 70.  Any recommendation?  AAA tells me there is a lot

of repair on both roads :-(



Also, about gas price, is there a wide difference of price along the

way?  There is nothing more frustrating then buying gas and extra

$0.20 per gallon and then drive another 10 miles and D'Oh!!>>

When I traveled out to VA from OR I went on 64 from Missouri.  When I went to
Milwaukie I went on 64, and when I went to Cleveland I went on the Northern
Route.  Supposedly the northern route is quicker from Milwaukie or Cleveland,
but 64 was a nicer drive.  The road construction slowed me down in WV, but
that was in July.  The construction and tourist travel should have tapered
off by now.  Where do you plan on stopping the night, or are you going
straight through?  Let me know if I can offer any advice about Virginia, or
other places to visit nearby in case you plan on extending your stay a little
bit.  

The gas prices are heaviest on the turnpikes and toll roads, with 94 octane
running about 1.65, and the 93 about 1.45.  On the regular interstates the
prices aren't bad, probably somewhere between 1.30 and 1.50 for 93.
