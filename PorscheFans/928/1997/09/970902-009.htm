I've installed two rebuilt with no problems.  I was told that the
rebuilt actually uses better quality seals.  The usual belt realignment
and tensioning applies.  You might want to check the condition of the
thermostatic belt tensioner.  Especially the rubber cap.  Mine was
hardened by the engine heat, broke into pieces and the belt lost its
tension! Gulp!  You also might want to replace the idler roller and the
mounting bolt.  Mine was making noises and the bolt broke off while
removing.

After all the previous posting about bent valves, which year applicable
etc,  I want to say that I've changed the belt twice already and each
time, I've managed to freely turn the cams and crank without any
interference.  (!?!)  Am I just lucky or what!?
