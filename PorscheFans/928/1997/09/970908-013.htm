I know this has probably already been discussed here before, however I
was thinking about it this weekend. I told everyone on the list about the
time I floored it on the freeway because the guy on the Katana gave me
'the look' - and got my accelerator pedal stuck to the floor. But I never
mentioned later checking the pedal to see why it had stuck and remedying
the problem.

The problem had to do with some mislaid carpeting, easily fixed, however
when I had the floor exposed, I noticed that the accelerator pedal has
two sets of bolt holes at the base  for adjustment. I was theorizing that
porsche would 'customize' the car a little bit according to your height,
or maybe depending on the average height of driver in the country the car
was going to (eg. japan). I would be interested to hear the true reason
from you porsche gurus.
