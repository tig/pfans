 Stephane,
Get a good set of headers and have them "Jet-Hot Coated" , it is a ceramic type
coating inside and out that insulates the headers and causes them to scavenge
the heat out of the exhaust quickly and is said to reduce underhood temps
dramatically. Major plus is that it has an almost permanent mirror finish. Most
of the more advanced performance companies offer this as an option on their new
headers (Devek included) and also offer the service to coat your existing
headers.
