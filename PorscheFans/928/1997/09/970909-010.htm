John,

  Based on what I see in Austin, their price is too high by $4-$6K (even
  considering that 5-speeds seem to command a bit more than the automatics).
  
  Here are some things that I had to deal with when I bought my '83 (which
  is essentially the same as the '84) and just some things I've learned
  from the list:
    - brake master cylinder (seals had started to leak)
    - new clutch (worn out at 32K miles courtesy of PO)
    - front tires (my car has always been hard on fronts)
    - rear cam seals (discovered to be leaking during clutch replacement)
    - clutch pedal was cracked near pivot point (crawl under with a flashlight
         and examine this piece - it is made of aluminum and can crack.
         Replacements are steel like the brake pedal)
    - timing belt (getting ready to install the second one since I've owned
         the car - should have the water pump replaced at the same time.
         Proper tension on the belt is extremely important)
    - My car has suffered from occasional no-starts.  Recommend turning the
      car on and off a few times before it is warmed up and then repeat the
      process after it has warmed up.  Let it sit awhile and try starting it
      again.  No-start problems can be a pain to debug.
    - OE Paris-Rhone alternator is poorly designed and prone to fail. (One
        of the diodes fell off of mine).  I found a Bosch replacement that
        looks like it could meet mil-spec standards.
    - This is a BIG one: there is a cup at the front of the guide rod for
      the shifter.  The nylon insert tends to wear and can cause the cup
      to pop off of its mounting point thereby leaving you without the 
      ability to shift.  The part is fairly inexpensive, but replacement
      is a pain (although Kurt has written up a good procedure that can
      be found in the FAQ).  If you buy the car, I'd recommend replacing
      this outright rather than waiting for it to fail.  I certainly will
      next time...
    - Large O-rings between the air flow meter/throttle body and also
      between the throttle body and its mounting plate can leak.  Listen
      for vacuum leaks.  Stumbling on accelleration (especially at low to
      mid revs) could indicate leaks.
    - edge connectors on instrument panel pod can become corroded.  Start
      the car and adjust the pod while looking for major fluctuations in
      the gauges.  Usually this can be remedied by cleaning the connections.
      
   Hopefully some other list members will give you tips as well.  As usual,
   complete records and a 928 mechanic's overview will tell a lot about the
   car.  Proper maintenance is critical.
