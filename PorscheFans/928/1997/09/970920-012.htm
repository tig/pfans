I just don't get these "kills" of the week.  

First, if I see another car going by at a good clip, I say "ooooh, that
guy and his car can go really fast in a straight line."

Second, about going 160+ on an open highway.  I think 2 posts recently
said something like they knew it wasn't smart and that they didn't need
a lecture or don't do it often.  Hmmm, is the extent of the lecture I'll
give.

However, before we get a series of posts such as this, let's consider
the consequences of POSTING these.  Let's say something goes horribly
wrong.  For example, we've all heard of, and have possibly seen police
officers that were sitting on the side of the road zealously take off
after speeders so zealously that they almost cause an accident.  For the
"kill" that was catching 2 other cars, let's say a police officer took
off after them off an entrance ramp just as you come up on them at
160+.  There's a lot of different ways things could go wrong - of course
they all have small probabilities (and the total probability is even
small).

Nonetheless, the price is very high.  Imagine that, after we post the
results of one kill, looking for our next something goes wrong.  The
lawyer for the harmed does a little digging, checks the archives and
sees your description of a kill.  I can't imagine any judge or jury
would let you be able to afford to drive for quite some time.

Of course we're all (or all about to be) PCA members so we can easily go
do driver's ed events where you're encouraged to go faster, they have
turns, ambulances, and corner marshalls to make sure there's nothing
around the blind turn.  It's fun on the track when you're going fast
enough that you can't lift without spinning the car - you can't do that
on the street (without taking a risk of losing everything you've got or
ever will get).

Sometimes I think we need more lawyers (no I'm not one). For the flamers
(please no "I-agree-with-you-e-mails"), I got my nomex lined helmet
ready (that other thing you have going for you at the track).

Trying to be sensible on the street and faster on the track,
Kurt
