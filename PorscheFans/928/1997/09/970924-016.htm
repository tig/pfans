<<I only have one thought concerning this, put enough small dust particles

together and you can build a mountain .;-(>>

Guys/gals,
I'm wondering why everyone is making such a big deal out of this K & N thing.
 No paper or fiberglass or even 24 karat gold air filter is going to filter
out all the dust particles in the air.  Do you guys have any idea how much
crap is in the fuel and oil that you put into your cars?  For that matter do
you know how many gnats wings and fly droppings that the FDA allows into the
pizza, spaghetti sauce and fresh fruits that you all eat?  And nothing has
happened to you so far.  I really wouldn't worry about the air filter deal -
K & N filters have been shown to flow better than any other filter and at a
savings over conventional filters after two or three cleanings.  Our Porsches
will be fine on top of being able to breathe better.  Buy K & N filters, eat
your vitamins, say your prayers and put peanut butter on your rear wings.
               =)
