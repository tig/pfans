I am looking for someone to tape the session so that those who are not able
to attend may still be able to see and hear what was discussed. Naturally, a
professional videoagrapher (sp?) and equipment would be best. If anyone
wants to volunteer please let me know. I will try to make worth your while.

On a somewhat related subject, I have a tape of "Hot Shoe" Kim Crumb at Lime
Rock. In a borrowed stock 928 he then proceeds to pass all other Porsches,
water cooled and air, that are in the red run group. Also on the tape is
"Rondevue". Talk about a Sunday drive!

Like you, I'm looking forward to a great event. I just hope I won't be too
busy to enjoy it. Ed
