John:

Go back to the basic stuff that makes the test readings, and diagnose from
there.  Basic readings are for HC, which is unburned fuel, and CO, a
byproduct of burning fuel.  Getting them balanced is a function of good
combustion (for HC) based on a correct mixture (for the CO.)  Use both
readings to assist in your diagnosis.  Also,  you must make adjustments with
the gas sample tube ahead of the catalyst.

High HC is from incomplete combustion.  Common causes are ignition misfire
caused by ignition component failure, and misfire due to improper fuel
mixture.  If the HC is high -and- the CO is OK, you are chasing an ignition
problem.  If the HC is high -and- the CO is low,  your mixture is too lean,
causing the misfire.

The possible ignition problems are pretty obvious, so I won't detail them here.

Sources of "too lean" include simple things like a poorly adjusted airflow
sensor,  but more typically involve vacuum leaks from poor hose connections,
faulty brake boosters, or hoses themselves cracking.  PCV, EGR and some
other emmission control items are possible contributors on cars equipped
with them, BTW.  Failed or weak injection nozzles or low fuel pressure are
more obvious at higher engine loads, so your low-speed problem is most
likely not one of these.  On the other hand, a vacuum leak is a constant
area, and reduces as a proportion to total air flow as the engine speed
increases.  Increasing manifold pressure as the speed and load increase also
lower the raw air dilution percentage.


Consider also some basic mechanical things that will contribute to misfire. You
are on the right track with the compression test.  Check the plugs, and see
if they are all the same color.  Obviously an odd colored plug will localize
your attention to the one or two troublesome cylinders.

Look at the timing belt and the cam timing.  Much mention has been made
lately about the potentials for belt problems.  On your early car the motor
will not be damaged directly by a belt failure.  But the failure mode seems
to be a jump of a tooth on a sprocket caused by a stretched or loose belt.
One cog off on the cam timing will cause the problem you describe.  A good
vacuum gauge is helpful for this -if- you don't have any exhaust
restrictions, which carries us smoothly to the next subject.  Otherwise,
check the belt and the cam timing.

A plugged or restricted catalyst will not on its own cause a high HC reading
at idle or near-idle speeds (in my limited experience ;-)) without some
other significant symptoms.  The reason that a plugged or restricetd
converter will cause high HC is this-- the high back pressure leaves spent
gasses in the combustion chamber.  Although they will dilute the incoming
charge, the spent gasses are functionally inert.  This doesn't cause a
misfire (and the high HC) unless the inert gas is a high enough
concentration to prevent ignition and/or impede flame propagation in the
chamber.

Quickest diagnosis for an exhaust restriction is a vacuum gauge fitted so
that you can read it while you drive.  If the engine mechanicals are OK,  a
restricted exhaust will cause the intake manifold pressure to slowly rise
while load is steady.  For instance,  drive the car at a steady speed and
load on level ground.  If you can see the pressure rising toward atmosphere
(same as "less vacuum") with no changes in throttle or load,  you may have a
restricted exhaust.  Other symptoms include poor higher RPM performance, a
choked exhaust sound, and often also include engine oil leaks.

There is mention made in another reply of the smog pump.  The purpose of the
smog pump is normally to provide additional air in the exhaust stream ahead
of the catalyst.  This extra air typically helps cool the catalyst, and
supports the catalytic reaction that makes CO (carbon monoxide) into CO2
(carbon dioxide).  That extra 'O' needs to come from somewhere.  On some
older American cars some air was injected into the exhaust immediately
downstream of the exhaust valves, actually causing any spare HC to burn in
the manifold and headpipe.  Thank goodness we don't have that!


These diagnostic procedures are general to almost any K-, L- or LH-injected
car.   Pretty sure that includes your '78.   Unfortunately,  I am not yet a
928 owner ;-(  although that will be remedied in the next 10 days or so.
=8-))  I'll be able to provide better details as I get my 'new' toy sorted
out and smog-checked.  And when I have the manuals...


Good Luck!  and please let me/us know what the final solution is.
