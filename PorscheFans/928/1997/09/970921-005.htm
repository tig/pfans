I second this.  R1's have sooo much more grip than ordinary performance
tires!  My Pantera and 2 Miata's always wear R1's and the A4Q doesn't simply
because it's my foul weather ride.  When I get a 928 (probably very soon
now) it probably will wear R1's too because they're just too damned much
fun...

The R1's generally last me a year or so of autoxing, track events and road
miles on my Miatas.  The Pantera gets less use (but it does go to track
events and drag strips), so they last even longer on it.

They're DOT legal, but their asymetrical tread design and minimal tread depth
when new (they're designed for showroom stock road racing) make them a poor
choice for a rain tire.  They have good stick on a wet surface, they just
can't penetrate standing water well.
