Tell you what, I want the old convertor if you replace it. If there are 
more hydrocarbons coming out of it than there are going in, its making 
fuel. Don't tell the oil companies. Seriously, this is not possible is 
it? The catalytic process splits molecules apart, it does not put them 
back together. Its entirely possible you need a new cat though. If your 
engine has been pumping out unburned fuel for as long as you imply, the 
convertor will have been overloaded. I'm not sure what style Porsche used 
in 78 but if it was the pellet type it could well be plugged. That might 
cause a misfire but if it were plugged that badly you would more readily 
notice a huge drop in power. The honeycomb types are less prone to 
plugging unless they severely overheat and melt or simply fall apart and 
physically plug things up. Same argument about lack of power though. A 
simple (easy for me to say your thinking) test is to unbolt the convertor 
and see if it idles OK but don't do it to early in the morning if you 
like your neighbors. Whatever the outcome I would certainly suggest you 
get to the root cause of your misfire before investing in a new convertor 
as it will go to same ultimate demise if you don't.
