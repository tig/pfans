PLUS!! (Now that I'm off the phone and can cocentrate) ... who set the land
speed record at Bonneville for unmodified stock production cars in 1987?  A
Porsche 928S4.  How much horsepower did a stock 928 have in 1987?  316+!  How
long did it take Corvette to get 300 hp? Um, 1995 I believe (not counting the
Lotus designed, Mercury Marine built ZR-1).  Let's just face it ... 928's are
the ultimate all around auto for the money.  Everyone check the list price of
your cars back when they were showrom new.  That money does account for
something ... quality, design, forthought to years of reliable use.  Hell, my
79 930 cost more in 1979 than a Corvette costs today in 1997.  And it's just
as rock solid as mu 10 year old 928.  There is no substitute.
