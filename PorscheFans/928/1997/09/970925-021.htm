A lot of people have had this problem.  This comes from corroding
connector between 
the pod and the main harness.  Look for the connector, take the
connection apart,
clean and try again.

Just remember that the powersteering fluid to use in a 928 is AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION
FLUID!!! (At least in my 85).  Putting the regular steering fluid will
lead to a leaky
rack...

This is just to put you on the track as I am not familiar with your
injection system.  There is a cold start injector that some people
had some problem with.  But I am just guessing ;-)

The chilton book should be use as a last ditch reference.  Some of the
information is inaccurate.  There are a lot of book on the Bosch
injection
system out there that could help you out.  For mechanical repair, the 
factory manual is the only way to go but is ~$280.  A cheaper
alternative is
the microfiche version for ~$40 but the picture quality is poor.  A good
third party reference would be the Mitchell Book.  Consult your local
library for availablity.

I won't laugh.  Mine need to be cleaned and waxed and the interior has
just been put back in (temporarily) for the trip.  I had to do it to
reduce road noise and try to get some sound in the car for the 850
miles trip.
