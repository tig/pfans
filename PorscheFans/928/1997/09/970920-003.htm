Well I have listened long enough. I have played around with a lot of
different cars, mostly in the UK though, to get better performance and
mileage. One of the changes I *always* did was to change the factory
thermostat to the manufacturers higher thermostat (they usaully have one).
An engine *likes* to run hot, just not too hot. The important thing is that
when the engine wants to drop the coolant temperature it is done
efficiently. The engine will then warm up quickly and run at a constant
temperature.

I have never had to do this to a Porsche because the factory puts a good
value thermostat in to begin with. Makeing the engine run cool increases
wear and degrades both performance and MPG.

My 928 has run on/above the second white mark since new. I have been to
track events and run the car *hard* in 90+F weather. I have seen
corvettes/others at events where they use water spray bottles to spray the
radiator and cool the engine. I have never had to do a thing! The
temperature will hardly vary and *never* approaches the red area. Maybe just
my opinion but the engineers at Porsche know what they are doing, don't
change components without understanding the impact to the vehicle.

While I'm delurked(tm) my oil pressure has remained the same since new. I
however, use 5w50 in my baby so figures are a little different to others I
have seen. When hot, I get 5bar at anything above 2000rpm, idle shows 2bar
dropping to 1.5bar as the oil gets nearer time to change. I probably could
get 5bar all the time with 50grade and no thermostat 8*>
