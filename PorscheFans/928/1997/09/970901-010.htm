<<Hi.  Noticed from your sig you have one of each.  How lucky you are!
When accelerating hard, which one is quicker to, say, 70 mph?  What are
your major likes and dislikes of each car?>>

AN-
Wow!  Tough question.  The 930 is definitely the faster car.  The 928 has
more low end torque, but when the boost kicks in on the 930 (around 3000 rpm)
there's nothing like it.  I can consistently beat CBR600's/GSX-R 750's, etc
from 0-100 mph.  There is nothing like a turbo 911.  As far as dislikes,
there aren't many.  Both my Porsches are black/black, so keeping them clean
is difficult!  Seriously though- the 930 gets horrible fuel economy in the
city (excellent on the highway though), and it's difficult to take them
anywhere I have to park them b/c of people dinging doors and not paying
attention.  The 928 is very expensive to maintain but is comfortable, quiet,
easy to drive, smooth riding and gets good fuel economy.  The 930 looks
beautiful, goes like a scorched rabbit and EVERYONE looks at it.  Older 911's
are real drivers cars though - you have to enjoy driving b/c they take a lot
of work and concentration.  Lots of feedback from the road, etc.  The only
downside to it is the rear tires tend to wear out quickly (and not from me
driving hard .. I NEVER turn the rear tires ... it's that the factory camber
is very negative).  Other than that I would highly recommend either car.
If you have any other question feel free to write me back or call.
