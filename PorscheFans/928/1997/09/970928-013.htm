There I was driving my 87 S4 on a country road and suddenly the engine
started to run really rough. I was able to limp home with visions of
repair bills in my head. After some investigation, it turns out that a
spark plug wire had somehow come loose and nearly fallen out of the head
cover. I have no idea how this happened. The plug wires look old -
probabaly original with 60K miles. Perhaps the little grippers on the
end that hold the plug are tired.  Has this happened to anyone else ?

I am thinking about replacing the wires, and I figured I might as well
replace the distributor caps and rotors as well. I'm looking for source
for plug wires; are the ones from the dealer best ? I'm wondering how to
replace the distributor caps - they look bolted to the timing belt
cover. 

Is this a difficult operation ?

Thanks,

Devin McEntee
