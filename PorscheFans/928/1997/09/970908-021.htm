To Jim Dobbins, Nelson Lathrop, Mark DaVia, and anyone else who's intereste=
d,

Here's the procedure I used to replace my resistor block, or pack, or modul=
e, whatever you want to call it.  Porsche calls it "Switch (Thermo Bi-Metal=
)" on the 928S 1983-1986 parts micro-fiche (Group 8, 13/30, item #41, if an=
yone's interested).  It's part # 928.618.101.01, and I got mine from DEVEK =
for $67.50.

	OK, first you have to remove the hood.  Disconnect the 2 hoses and 1 wire =
from near the passenger side hood hinge.  Place plenty of padding over the =
engine compartment and fenders to protect your paint in case you slip.  Mar=
k the position of the 4 bolts holding the hood to the hinges to make re-ins=
tallation easier.  Then, (this takes two people) have someone hold the hood=
 while you undo the hood shocks and then the hinge bolts.  Carefully lift t=
he hood off and put it in a safe place.  It's pretty light since it's alumi=
num - the wife can help.

	Next, pull off the rubber weatherstrip/seal at the top of the firewall (fi=
rewall to hood seal).  Now you can pop up the front of the big plastic drip=
 pan and pull it out (the back of the drip pan fits under the cowl on tabs =
- no screws).

	Under this plastic drip pan is the blower motor (on the passenger side), t=
he black plastic evaporator housing (in the center), and the windshield wip=
er motor (driver's side).

	Now, at about the middle of the car, just to the passenger side of the AC =
lines, you'll see a black, rectangular electrical connector, maybe 3/4" x 1=
 1/2" at the end of a wiring harness, plugged into the evaporator housing. =
 Unplug this connector.  It's a 7-pin connector I believe, and when you unp=
lug it, you're looking at the back of the resistor block/pack.  It's held i=
nside the black plastic evaporator housing by 2 screws on opposite corners.=
  The only problem is, the darn thing on the other side of the rectangular =
hole is too big to pull out through the hole!  If you don't believe me, try=
 it. If you can undo the two screws and pull it out of there, you'll save y=
ourself a lot of work.  I couldn't.  In fact, if you can get it out this wa=
y, you don't even need to take the hood off.  But you can't, so I'll go on.=
...

	The next step is to remove the blower motor so that you can reach into the=
 evaporator housing and get the resistor block/pack.  I couldn't get my blo=
wer motor out without first taking off the cowl trim piece.  In order to do=
 that, you have to do the following:  Remove the windshield wiper arms, pop=
 off the two windshield molding strips on each side of the windshield (slid=
e joining clips at top corners up to expose joint).  This will expose a scr=
ew on each end of the cowl piece.  Remove these two screws and the two bolt=
s near the hood area.  Carefully lift off the cowl piece and put it in a sa=
fe place where it won't get stepped on.

	Now you can get the blower motor out.  It's held in by three screws.  I ha=
d to remove the passenger side hood hinge completely to get at the first sc=
rew.  Another screw is hidden inside the mouth of the blower.  You have to =
pull back/remove the rubber mating piece between the blower motor and the e=
vaporator housing to get at it.  The third screw is under the dash/glovebox=
 area.  You have to remove the underdash tray to get to it easily.  After r=
emoving these three screws, you can disconnect the wiring connector and rem=
ove the blower motor.

	Now(!), you can look into the evaporator housing with a flashlight and see=
 the resistor module.  Reach in and grab it and undo the two screws holding=
 it in and remove it.  Install a new one the same way and put everything ba=
ck together.

	Wow!  Wasn't that fun!

	BTW, While it's apart, clean out all the leaves and debris from inside tha=
t whole area, especially under where the blower motor goes.  Also, now is a=
 good time to check the blower motor for wear.  You can unsnap the metal cl=
ips from the blower housing, open it up, and pull out the motor.  Try to mo=
ve the shaft from side to side.  If there's any play in there, your bearing=
s are probably worn. Mine was.  As Vince Yu pointed out, that causes the mo=
tor to draw more current and probably contributed to one of my resistors bu=
rning out.  It could also be a cause for the resistor block to "overheat", =
thus tripping the thermostatic switch, and switching the fan up to "high" t=
o cool it off (as someone mentioned).  The "Magic Blower" syndrome!

	Anyway, a new blower motor is about $245.00, or you could try your luck wi=
th a used one.  Another option might be to find an auto electric shop that =
rebuilds/reconditions Bosch motors.  Maybe they could just replace the bad =
bearings.  I just bought a new one...

	Well, that's what I did, if someone has an easier method please let me kno=
w.  It's not really that difficult, just a pain.

	Good luck!

	BTW, all my blower speeds work now.
