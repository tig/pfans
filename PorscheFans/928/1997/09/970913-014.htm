Hello fellow shark types!!
Got my rims in friday and <wow>... I had never really held a 17x9 in my
lap before!!!  These are the biggest wheels I have ever owned!  This is
really obvious, given my previous attraction to 4-cylinders: 14" or 15"
was the largest they need!
Mounted those 285/40-17s to the back, took em home, fully expecting them
to rub the fenders, and YAY!! No rubbage!! I have approx. 1/4" to the
fender lip under compression (2 big guys in the hatchback, bouncing the
car)
The fronts, 255/45-17 fit fine but they would probably rub on the top
were it not for my Weltmeister 428 in/lb springs. They tend to keep the
ride firm.....
Damn Is The Ride Smooth!
NEVER, EVER allow yourself to "get used to" a bent wheels
vibrations.....  Replacing those wheels was a vehicular
transformation/reincarnation.  Feels the same, but faster and smoother
and more tempting somehow!  The car went from a nervous jittery thing
over 80 mph, to a glassy smooth hovercraft!  Now I feel the very
dangerous urge to just >hold< that little innocent flat pedal to it's
stop, and feel that acceleration press me back... for just a few seconds
longer.....  .  .  (sorry, daydreaming again)

But BEFORE that happens _too_ much, I would like to replace my front
ball joints.  Not because they are showing wear or play, but because all
the chat about the early ones failing has got me edgy.. I keep imagining
what it would feel like @ >extra-fast< speeds to lose a ball
joint....(ungh)
Would those recently enlightened with this process, please drop me a
mail with some of the traps (if any) you encountered during the update,
and (if handy) the part numbers to bring the car up to steel joints..
Thanks in advance!!!
---PT  Scan-fest is ensuing, with photos galore!!---

Have a good day! I'm going driving!  ~~~
