Brian,

I wonder how much it needs to be lifted?  A few inches, or a lot?  I wonder=
 if you need to disconnect the drive train to do this?  Anyone know? (I don=
't have the factory manuals - maybe I need to get them.)

"... What I want to know is what else should we do While You're In There (W=
YIT) and the engine is raised?  New motor mounts, headers..."

Good question!  I hadn't gotten that far yet.  I don't know how you can tel=
l if your motor mounts need replacing unless they're obviously shot.  That =
would probably be a good time to do it though, if it needed it.  Maybe the =
rear main seal should be replaced if the drive train needs to come off.(?) =
 On the parts microfiche it looks like there's a lot of stuff inside the oi=
l pan as far as the oil pick-up goes, screens and stuff.  I don't remember =
exactly, have to look at it again, but some of this stuff would probably ne=
ed cleaning at least (if not replacement).  Headers are a bit pricey for me=
 right now, too many problems to fix first (like AC, leaks - engine and aut=
o trans., ball joints, shocks, etc.) but while it's apart....

P.S.  Glad you're down to just one leak now!
