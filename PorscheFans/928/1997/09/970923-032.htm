Well, its been a while since I have asked for help (the brake experience
cooled my
mechanical inclination for a while...)

1. We discussed changing the hose to the windshield nozzle a while back
and i have
a different problem, the little plate that connect the hoses to the
nozzle to the
hoses going to the hood has broken connection.  Well $10 later, I have a
new plate
with the little connectors.  My question is how do you get the
electrical wires through
that little hole if you have a nozzke at one end of the wires and a big
connector at the other
end?

2. To remove the windshield washer reservoir, do you just remove that 1
bolt on the bracket
or is there some other bolt that is not visible to the naked eye?

3. The y piece leading to the charcoal canister is split (part # 928 201
219 02).  Will this
affect performance of my car (vacuum leak?)

4. There is a small black knobby sensor inside my air intake box, what
is it for?

5. On the air box cover, passenger side, there is a large connector
going downward
to a large rubber tube (to where??) but there is also a small connection
for a smaller
tube (parallel to the ground). Where does it goes?  I don't even have a
hose in that area...

TIA, I am back with the questions :-o
