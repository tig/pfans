 OK, I'll submit my data point here. I have noticed that there *is* 
indeed some (fairly?) significant chassis flex on my (heavily) modified 
'82 autocrosser/time-trials 928.  I drive the car to all events hauling a 
4x8 box trailer with all the racing goodies, including a set of racing 
wheels/tires. At the event, I swap each side's wheels out by lifting at 
only one jack point on each side--it can be either the front spot or the 
rear.  (The suspension mods are so stiff that I can actually change three 
wheels out, if I wanted by lifting a few extra inches at the jack point, 
but this seems like it might exert a little too much torque on things.)  
What I've noticed is that when I am lifting the car the hatch is *very* 
difficult to close, and the doors are somewhat difficult.  I don't know 
if this is normal, or the result of incredibly abusive driving + mods... 
One thing is for sure, atleast from my experiences: "The stiffer, the 
better" ...at least for high-speed racing applications.
