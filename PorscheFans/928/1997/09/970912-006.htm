After years of lusting and 3 other Porsches (924 and 2 944s) I'm getting 
close to buying a 928 and would appreciate some advise.

What are the problems associated with owning a Euro version?  I've seen 
some nice examples with low miles and low prices.  I assume parts are 
difficult to come by.  Any other big problems specific to Euros?

Is there really a problem with the manual transmissions?  I keep hearing 
horror stories, but usually from people trying to sell cars with autos.

Was there a change in the seats between the '86 S and '87 S4?  When I 
adjust the driver's seat in the earlier cars, if my legs are at a 
comfortable distance, my head is bumping into the roof.  In later cars, 
this doesn't seem to be a problem.  Is there really a difference, and if 
so, is a retrofit or some other adjustment possible?

Thanks in advance,

Bill Coleman
