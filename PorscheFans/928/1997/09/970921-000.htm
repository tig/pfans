Marc asked:

>>I realize this is not an economy car, but I am wondering if I would be
able to afford the maintenance costs on a ten year old 928. I am not a
very good mechanic, and I have never owned a 928. Would anyone care to
comment?

How affordable it is depends largely on how you treat, drive, and insure it,
who repairs/maintains it, and where you get the parts. Here is my top 10 list
of suggestions you might want to consider in order to keep the cost
reasonnable:

1. Buy the latest model 928 you can afford (unless you find one with really
low mileage). Take advantage of the constant improvements that have been made
during the 928s production time.

2. Before you buy, have a 928 specialist inspect the car. What he doesn't
detect before you buy can cost you serious money later.

3. If you own (not finance) the car, and don't drive too wild, consider
dropping the collision insurance. Saves me around $ 500 each 6 months...

4. Stick to the maintenance recommendations of the factory, and don't go
overboard. Don't change the oil all 3k miles as recommended by Jiffy Lube.
Use Mobil 1 or similar quality Oil. Yes, there are superior oils, coolants,
and other things available at a premium, but do you really need them? I
believe, if you would, or if there was a serious benefit, the factory would
recommend these items. Unless you go racing you won't drive any wilder than
people in Germany, and their cars tend to last pretty well...

5. Have the timing belt checked and replaced regularly. It could save you a
lot of money down the road.

6. Find a mechanic that has a lot of experience with 928s to avoid timely and
costly screwups - the 928 is complex, but someone who knows what he's doing
can fix most things at reasonnable rates

7. Participate in the 928 list at porschefans.com. Here you can find lots of
free, often money-saving advice. 

8. Shop around for parts. Ask 928 International, Parts Heaven, or the members
of this 928 newsgroup, if you need anything major. Sometimes used parts will
do at less than half the cost.

9. Don't do any major modifications to your 928 - leave it as close as
possible to stock. Modifications cost you a lot of money, and since you won't
recover these investments when reselling the car you should only invest in
them if you know you're going to keep the car forever (Leonard has some
interesting thoughts about his issue...) 

10. Porsche recommends to drive safely and always obey traffic laws. Stick at
least to the first of these two...

Best of luck!!
