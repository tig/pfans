Thanks to all who took the time to respond to my inquiries regarding my
upcoming wheel and tire upgrade. (You know who you are) 
The decision is all mine now. (leaning to the 17's ---- no offense to those
suggesting 18's)   

David and Bill ---- I'm glad you guys made up. I knew 928ers were people too!

Kurt ---- Do you have an alignment rack? ---- if not, how are you checking
camber?
(couldn't find, but it seems like I read a post recently where someone said
they were going to post an at home method of aligning, or at least checking)

Could someone (Leonard?) who has a proper alignment (stock suspension)
without front inside tire wear please post alignment readings? (taken from
your last alignment computer readout sheet) I am assuming that if you don't
have tire wear you must have hit the optimum setup and not just "in spec".
Perhaps several "non tire wear" people could post for comparison? ---- (or
confusion!) ---- (I realize it must be a proper "settled suspension"
alignment)   
Ed and James ---- what's this about 3 adjustments of each adjustible setting
and why? Even though the adjustments affect each other, it just seems like
when the machine readouts say they're ok, that would be it. Is it just a fine
tuning thing?

Stephane ---- still debating the 13 hr. drive to Va.? .... If you decide to
go, give me a yell. I'm on the way.

David ---- did you ever get a final response from K & N regarding the fine
particle filtering capabilities of their product compared to paper? (still
concerned about engine protection)

Where is this flap? that allows you to clean the leaves and debis from the
ventilation ductwork?
(couldn't find original post, but I think I remember someone saying that it
was a prime place for corrosion to start if it wasn't cleaned occasionally.)
  

Also, all this talk about 1/4 mile times for the 928 is ok; and true, it's
faster than most anything on the street; that is not it's forte. It is the
compilation of the things it does well, and the competence in which it does
them, that makes it a true supercar; and it's not hindered by things like
150mph speed-limiters, copycat engineering, and the likes, that keep cars
like Supra Turbos, 300 ZX's, etc..... behind it, and even more so when the
road opens up for stretches longer than 1/4 mile. (not to mention the fact
that these cars are 10 years newer)
                                                                    We lead
---- they follow, and the 928 doesn't have to prove a thing.
