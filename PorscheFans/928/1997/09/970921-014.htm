Hi everyone,

I am new to PorscheFans, but have been a Porsche 928 enthusiast for
many years.  I have been following your mail messages for several
weeks, and has find them to be extremely helpful.  Now I am finally
prepared to buy the car of my dreams!  

I found a decent looking '88 928 in the Los Angeles area with a clean body. 
The car appears to be well maintained and has service records.  However, the 
interior, especially the beige carpet which covers the cockpit is pretty 
dirty and worn out.  

I was wondering if anyone can recommend a good reliable 928 mechanic in/near
the Los Angeles area (preferably West Los Angeles/Santa Monica) to whom
I can take the car for a pre-purchase inspection and for future servicing
after I get a 928.  Also, I would appreciate if someone can recommend
the best solution to replacing the interior carpets.


Thanks a bunch. Looking forward to your replies.

Patrick Yao
