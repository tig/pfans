Stephane,

Thanks for the comments.
Yes, the gear oil we use is Swepco, and it is light green. Looks close to
anti-freeze in color, but one whiff and one roll between the forefinger and
thumb lets one know it is gearoil.
Just after I bought the car the radiator let go. There was no sign of patches
by the PO, so I can only assume it was a coincidence it went right after I
bought the car. At any rate, I put in a new Devek all aluminium radiator.
This didn't have any affect on the leaking rear end. It leaked before and
after the new radiator was installed.

The hairline crack idea is a good one. I guess one  could argue that a
porious casting should leak fron day one, where a crack could develop later
in the life of the car. I purchased the car about a year ago. And, as I
mentioned, a write up on the new buyer's inspection was a "moist transaxle
housing". The PO didn't mention any chronic problem and nothing in the
maintenance records indicates so. So, with the data so far, a small crack is
just as feasable as a porious casting.
I would like to find out more about the warrenty issue you mentioned!!

Thanks again
