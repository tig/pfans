 928 Fans,
I can no longer contain myself concerning the topic of the 928 chassis rigidity
(or lack of).

I have PERSONALLY driven, worked on, disassembled and modified 928s of almost
all year models for over 8 years. The one thing that always impressed me first
about the 928 was its lack of rattles, and its completely solid feel no matter
what year model or lack of owner maintenance.

On every 928 that I have every lifted from one corner with a floor jack the
doors. hood and hatch always open and close with that famous 928 solid thud. On
every other vehicle model or make that I have worked on that has not been the
case.

Lately I have been reminded of this fact by the daily work I am engaged in with
the restoration of my 79 Euro. Every time I jack up one front side to where the
front tire is 3-4" off of the ground I look back and the rear tire is about 2"
off of the ground. Not bad for a 18 year old car that is supposed to be made of
"rubber". Even in this position the doors, hatch and hood work flawless.

Concerning the fact of a 928 flexing with its roof cut off, there is not a
unibody made that will not flex like that when you cut out a major part of the
chassis structure, I bet if the same thing was done to a 911 it would IMPLODE.
Why do you think everyone does so much research to stiffen a chassis on a
convertible conversion, the roof is part of the chassis and plays a major role
in the chassis stiffness. (unless it is designed as a convertible by the
manufacturer, not amateurs)

Anyone who says the design needed a few more years of development should
disassemble a 79 and an 89 in the same  week period.  You would be amazed at the
lack of changes between the 2 cars in all aspects, this just shows me how well
it was designed in the first place.(unlike other Porsches that they have been
trying to sort out for decades and finally give up and start over).

Just my 928 cents worth,
