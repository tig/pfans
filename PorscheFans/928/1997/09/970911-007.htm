This is only a guess as the other answer you are receiving
so far are pointing to the rollers.  However, I remember someone
mentioning that, after their belt had been replace, the harmonic
balancer was not torqued right and the thing went flying out.

Also, what kind of water punp do you have?  I would guess that a
failed bearing on the water pump might also rattle (if a failed
bearing on a roller rattles, why not on a water pump??)

Good luck, let us know what you find...
