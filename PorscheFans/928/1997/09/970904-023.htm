OR Moira could give me a call.  As most of you know (please don't forget!) I
do auto locating and brokering and am more than willing to help out a P-fan!
 As far as my services go - I require a $50 non-refundable deposit to cover
time and expenses should you decide not to purchase a car through me.  Then
you and I will have a conversation to discuss all the info concerning exactly
what you are looking for.  I then go to work and usually find between 8 and
15 cars for you to choose from.  I then will call all 8-15 owners and get all
the info on their cars (this is where the $50 covers me), such as colors,
miles, histories, service records, damage, paintwork, pictures, videos,
etc...  Then I will get back in touch with you and let you decide which one
or two you would like to pursue further.  From there my fees will depend on
how involved you want me to be in you buying the car.  I can arrange to have
the car checked out by a reputable mechanic in the owner's home area, or I
can even fly there to inspect the car myself.  If you wanted to fly to
wherever the car was and drive it home you would have the option, or I could
check into having it shipped to you.  Depending on how much work I would put
into the deal my fees could run from $400 to $1200 dollars, but I am much
cheaper and offer more personal service than any other broker you will find.
	Turn around time from when you call me to when you own the car (of course
depending on how soon you are ready to buy) will range from 2 days to about a
week.  I have very good luck finding Porsche and Mercedes-Benz, and I do know
quite a bit about Porsche cars from owning two!.  Please consider me when you
are ready to start looking for a 928 and feel free to E-mail me back or call
with any questions you might have.
