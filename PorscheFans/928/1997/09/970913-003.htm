If you want to put 18" rims on a 928 without body mods, these are the best
approximations to the right wheel and tire sizes, but that's a big "if"
(see below).

Yes, if they're also two inches larger in diameter or, more to the point,
if the rim is a full inch closer to the road. Tire sidewalls are not
perfectly vertical, but flare out as they approach the tread, so if the rim
meets the sidewall closer to the tread, it should be wider.

Apart from whether everything will fit without rubbing under the fender,
these are some of the big issues with going to 18". You're reducing the
sidewall height by a full inch (18" rim diameter means 9" rim radius v. 8"
for stock, while the tire diameter and rolling radius are, as you've
calculated, substantially the same). If this doesn't sound like a lot, bear
in mind that the stock sidewall is 4.4" high in front, 4.3" in the rear
(245 mm section width x 0.45 aspect ratio x 0.03937 inch/mm), so going to
18" rims reduces this by more than 20% (265 x 0.35 x 0.03937 = 3.65").

So, backed up by real-world experience, this gives you stiffer sidewalls,
which give crisper steering response and more linear slip-v.-cornering
force, but also knock your teeth out (no more touring in YOUR car!) and
also make it much more likely that the rim be will be bent or broken when
you hit a pothole or big bump. The extra noise will come from you when your
kidneys hurt or you see the rim damage.

I had the same gung-ho motive you express and did the same calculations and
shopping, but was warned away from 18" by a unanimous chorus of authorities
(including two you mention in your message) and went instead for the
compromise of 17" equipment in GTS sizes.

Let me assure you, based on well over a year's experience with this
arrangement, that this package gives radically sharper steering and
cornering, but does not significantly increase ride harshness or noise.

I encourage you to proceed as follows:

First, swap your wheels and tires for GTS-spec items. This is a big deal, a
very major change in the car's personality (all to the positive, in my
opinion). It will take you quite a while to metabolize the steering and
cornering (and braking, for that matter) improvements you'll receive,
during which time you can decide how much more crispness you really need.

By the way, tires matter a lot here. I got the Michelin Pilot SX MXX3s in
Porsche N0 spec for a lot of reasons, one of which is that they're the most
crisply responding of the ultra tires. I'm really pleased with the result
(super handling without losing long-haul touring comfort).

Then, if you still want more, go for new springs and shocks, but again
consider liveability. Kim's package will lower the car (graunch!), stiffen
the ride, and otherwise put itself in your face. An interesting compromise
with which David Roberts gets very satisfactory results is to go to GTS
springs and shocks, which give you some more crispness without losing
comfort and do not put the car so much closer to real-world irregularities
in road surfaces.

>Also, would I be insane, and just completely spoil the civility of my 928, if
>I did both?

I think so (see above).

>(I know, you all are gonna say just do the suspension upgrade --
>but then I wouldn't have groovy new wheels!)

Surprise! I say get slightly less groovy wheels now and wait on the springs.
