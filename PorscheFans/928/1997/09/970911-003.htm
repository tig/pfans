when I installed a new battery.

I also put a new battery into my '88 S4 recently (one cell had failed, and at
10V all it did was a ticking/clicking of the starter relais).

To my big surprise the car now starts WAY better than ever (before the old
battery broke down). In the past I sometimes had to crank it for a couple of
seconds in the morning. Now it's just "turn the key and it runs" - smoother
than ever before.  :-)

Never had a such experience with my other cars - and for that reason did not
dare to mention it to the group. Thought you guys would think I'm crazy...
