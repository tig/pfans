ANY synthetic will.

I doubt it also.  I've been using 5W50 Castrol Syntec for over 100,000 miles in
my 87 Audi 5000s almost 5 years.  It uses no oil whatsoever during a normal 
7,500
mile change interval. I use it in my Blazer as well 134,000 and now in my 928 
coming up on it's first 7 k change since I bought it June of 97.


As for several sources that say Castrol Syntec will
leave deposits in various places in your engine. Call my mechanic, I don't see 
any deposits in my heads or cam,
and as him what the inside of my Audi look like, the only motor work has been 
timing belt and valve cover gaskets.


Old 928's never die we just make them go faster.
