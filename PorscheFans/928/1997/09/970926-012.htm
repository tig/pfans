A nice tip.

Steve,
Glad you survived your first autocross - some don't =:-O

You, and the others on this list who are getting into x'ing should know
that there is a mail list dedicated to the subject.  You won't find much
(if any) 928-specific comment since list members (about 900) drive
everything from Lotus 7's to Triumphs to Ferrari's to 911's.  But, you
will find a lot of commentary on technique, suspension set-up and tips
like Jim's 'shoe polish trick' from his message above. The list is
administered by the Team.Net website (that's: http://www.team.net/).

To subscribe, send an email message to majordomo@autox.team.net, with
'subscribe autox' or 'subscribe ax-digest' in the body of the message,
no subject.
