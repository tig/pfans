It sounds like the same thing that happened to my '90 S4. It had a weak
battery and would lose enough charge over a week that it wouldn't start.
Once, after a jump start, the car started, but it shook violently like it was
on 4 cylinders. I revved the engine thinking it might be a collapsed lifter.
I backed it out of the driveway thinking it needed to be warmed up. Nothing
helped. I stopped the engine fearing the worse. I put a battery charger on
the car and later restarted the car with my fingers crossed. It started and
ran fine. I put in a new battery and the problem never has returned. I don't
know if one of the computers had a problem while the car was jump started or
what.
I don't know if that will help, but a lot of little problems I had went away
when I installed a new battery.
