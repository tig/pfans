Hi 928 fans!

Where to begin?  This is the third post for me in 2 days.  All of my right
buttons are being pushed, I guess.  I have several passions.  928's, are
without a doubt, the finest cars I have ever owned.  My first car was a 79
auto, US spec car that I really liked, except that it wasn't exactly a ball
of fire, to put it mildly. But I was hooked on the cars.  I sold it and
bought a pristine, almost new, 85 5 speed 32V car and what a difference!
 This car was an absolute bullet. I firmly believe that there has not been a
stock mustang produced up until the present 32V Cobra, that it would not just
flat blow the doors off of. From zero on up.  I raced one mustang GT that I
could not pull, and came to find out that it had an aftermarket supercharger
installed.  Otherwise, it was no contest. I had a newborn daughter with
medical problems in 92, so the 928 got sold. <sniff>
I recently found a 79 US 5 speed car, with some suspension damage from
hitting a curb for $2000.  Not my first choice with the ugliest green
interior you have ever seen, but a straight, rust free nice body.  I replaced
the damaged parts, replaced the timing belt and did some routine stuff to it
and have been driving it.  This is a 220 hp
second year car that has not had much TLC.  It made it the first 3000 miles
without adding oil, and the only annoying feature, is the
typical-on-old-porsches worn out 2nd gear synchronizer.  Anyway, to get to
the point, I have an employee with a 2 year old 5.0 mustang GT 5 speed who
talked me into a little drag race.  We have a service road leaving the shop
that is a 1/2 mile long. ( I dont want to get yelled at for endangering
lives) and to make a long story short, we both had a clean run ( no excuses
like missed a shift or had my floormat wadded under my throttle bla bla bla)
.......My almost 20 year old car , bone stock, flat kicked the V8 mustangs
butt.  By 2 full car lengths in approx. 1/8 of a mile.  And this old 79 is a
snail compared to the 85 I had. Aint no way on gods green earth any V6
mustang is going to out accelerate  any 928, unless there is something
terribly wrong with the 928.  Like a couple plug wires off.  
My other passion is-----drag racing.  I have just installed a 460 V8 in an 86
thunderbird for bracket racing.  I have had it out a couple times now and am
starting to get the bugs out.  It has so far run a best time of 12.1@111 mph.
 I am in New Mexico at 5500 feet.  It's a lot of fun, but the wife hates it.
A 98 Corvette was out this past weekend and he ran a best of 14.6, a viper
ran 13.8, and most of the fairly stock 5.0 mustangs are running middle 15's
to middle 16's. If I were to run my poor old 928, I would expect to see
somewhere around a high 15.  These are realistic numbers.  Dont believe
everything you read in the car magazines..........................
( there is however, one guy with a street driven mustang with a 347 cid
supercharged, nitrous etc that runs 9.60's @ 144 mph.....scary!  )
Sorry to ramble, and I fully expect some flames!
