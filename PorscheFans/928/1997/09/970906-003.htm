Equine doo-doo! I'd like to know where this article appeared, because, I've
heard the same statements with the same numbers from all sorts of people
just recently, adding to my suspicion that it all radiates from one source.

First, however much aluminum there may be in a 928, it's not anywhere
important to the rigidity of the car; neither the hood, the doors, nor the
engine is a stressed part.

Second, no one on this list, nor any other 928 owner known to me, has ever
observed such a phenomenon. These are unusually rigid cars, and they stay
that way.

Third, if aluminum structures lose their rigidity in five to ten years,
what are all those 20+ year old 747s, 727s (e.g., the NY-DC and NY-Boston
shuttles), and DC-10s doing still flying, not to mention DC-3s with 50+
years on them? Their operators check them for cracks per FAA regs, not for
creeping noodle-ization, and they're ALL aluminum.

This strongly appears to be what Peter Albrecht would call an urban legend.
