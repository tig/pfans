At first I told everyone I had a Porsche, now I keep it quiet. When
someone finds out I have one, they are shocked that I was so "modest"
not to say anything. For me, it's about driving it, not showing off.

What I hate is when I get asked "how much?". If everyone knew how
affordable a Porsche can be, it wouldn't be the same anymore. Don't tell
anyone!!!
