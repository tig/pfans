<<  Gene,



If you can find us a "pro" that can do a  PROPER 4 wheel alignment on a =

928 for $39.95 (no matter how long it takes, I think most of us would =

give you a $50 finders fee, I know I would. ;-)>>

I payed $105 at NTW, and had to force them to replace the front tire for free
in less than 6K miles.  I have now added about 4K to the new tires, and I
have a sneaking suspiscion that the alignment still isn't done right.  By the
way, NTW and NTB, and Tire America, and Sears, and so on, are all co-owned
and service each other's warranties.  This was a tremendous advantage when I
had the problems appear in Virginia, after an alignment in Texas.
