Okay......gotta offer my .02 here.........

In a couple of my previous rides, 'The Smell' took up residence.  In
both cases, it was caused by mold growing in air diverter box (non
Porsche) in one instance, and in the A/C housing in the other instance
(again, non Porsche).  The air box villain looked about like dust/dirt,
but sorta moist (gee......does that make it mud?).  The A/C alien
invader appeared more like the light green variety you would associate
with mold.  These cars were in different parts of the country, and I've
since learned that each region has it's own unique population of smelly
invaders (molds).  I'm sure someone else in here is much more versed
than me about conditions, varieties, etc.

The solution for me was to get to the affected (infected?) areas and
give a good diluted Clorox washdown.  This served well during the time I
had those cars.

I don't know how feasible, but maybe you could test by spraying the
bleach solution into a port or up the drain tube for the A/C evaporator
housing?  There is absolutely nothing in there that can be harmed, but
you don't wanna flood the area, either.

As a last resort, maybe borrow the machine from 'Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids', zap yourself and wander around inside there until you find the
problem or slay the invaders!

Good Luck.
