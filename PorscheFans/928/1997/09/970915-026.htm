Fellow 928er's,

	Thought I'd forward these comments about wheels and metallurgy for
reference. I also have a couple of questions for the membership. I heard
over the weekend from a ex-928 owner that the early cars had a cylinder
head design that was not opmtimized from a coolant flow point of view,
and as a result the steam pockets that could develop---sometimes caused
head gasket problems. Anyone had this experience??---I've not seen any
mention of it in the digest. Secondly, another guy told me that the 944
turbo heads bolt on to the early block and offer the advantage of a
better shaped combustion chamber and larger valves that are made of a
material to better handle the high temps one would encounter when
supercharging or turbocharging a 928---any comments??.

Thanks in advance,

Mike McLaughlin

Brian,
	Whoever told you that a polishing operation on a alloy wheel would
affect the strength of the assembly has a lot to learn about metallurgy.
The only surface working that CAN degrade a metal components ability to
perform it's intended function---is grinding, or in the case of
alloys---machining with a tool on--say--a lathe. In the case of
grinding(usually on carbon steel materials), if a too agressive media is
used without proper cooling, you can set up "hard spots" that may lead
to micro-cracking because you are altering the grain structure of the
material at the surface. On alloys, if the tool left a surface finish
that was rough enough---you can set yourself up with a surface that has
a lot of what are called "stress risers". Picture the surface as now
having a strong definition of --peaks and valleys. Because any component
that is subject to dynamic loading (i.e. wheels, forged suspension pcs.,
etc.) concentrates the forces at the surface, this machined surface now
has a lot of sharp radii--where the forces can concentrate, and under
the right conditions---a crack can originate and then start to
propagate.

	It's also not a good idea to try and bend back--or hammer back a alloy
wheel to it's original shape--say--after kissing a curb or
something...because when you move the material by uncontrolled
mechanical means you are "cold-working" it, and can severly alter the
surface hardness of the material--what we call, changing the ductility
of the material. On cast wheels, the repair attempt often leads to a
piece outright breaking off. On spun aluminum wheel halfs, like those
used on the composite 3-piece from BBS, sometimes the material can be
gently persuaded back to a shape that allows the continued service of
the wheel. But you always run the risk of having created micro-cracks at
the damaged area. I, for one, always check the area with a
flourescent-dye penetrant test method---that will reveal any
micro-cracking. If nothing shows, I will polish the surface to a mirror
finish in the area of the affected repair---to, again, minimize any
possibility of  stress risers being left in the material.
	Rest assured that polishing--if anything--makes the surface MORE
resistent to these forces concentrating at any specific area. You are
right that polishing techniques as applied to alloys very rarely causes
any significant localized heat build-up. In fact, it is an old racer
trick to polish the beams of connecting rods as used in high
compression--high rpm engines, as a reliability measure---to minimize
any possibility of stress risers and extend the life cycle of the
component.
	The only surface process that can present problems on wheels is powder
coating. This is because the coating is more compliant than the metal
substrate---and if a crack starts in the metal---you may not even see it
in the powder coating. For this reason, it is illegal in most competent
run racing organizations to even use powder coat on wheels or suspension
pieces such as A-arms.

Hope this clears things up a bit for you!

Best regards,

Mike McLaughlin
