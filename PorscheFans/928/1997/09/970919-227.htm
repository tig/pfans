All:

I'm now the at the one-week mark with my new toy, but have been reading the
list for almost a month.  Ok, I'm NEW.. =8-)

PO mentioned when I picked the car up (22k miles) that the new tires are the
second set he's put on it.  My simple brain said "..second set of tires on
the car.."  rather than what the service history shows, two replacement
sets.  During the past few days there has been a series of posts on
alignment and tire life, with dangerou$ly low numbers in it for tire life.

So, how many miles can I expect?  Gray haired ex-Lotus racer, tamed down for
street driving,  pampering new baby, etc.  That will change of course after
I have some time and space to sort the car and the driver out a bit.  Hair
will stay gray.  Tires are BFG VR4's, with UTQG=300.  This was my
recommendation for replacement after looking at some with 120 ratings.

I was looking at this as a daily driver when I got it.  Will I need a
standing appointment at the tire store?


After about 1200 very gentle street miles,  the casting titties are down to
mere nubs on the front ribs.  I guess I need to get out the tread depth
gauge and monitor the wear a bit.  The eye is always optimistic about such
things, but the gauge doesn't lie.

Also-- Recommendations of inflation pressure?



Thanks for the help,

dr bob
