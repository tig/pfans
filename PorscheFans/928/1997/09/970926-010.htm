 I've done 35 or 40 autocrosses/time trials with quite a variety of 
set-ups.  By far, my best set up was:
A) 4) R1's on 8x16 Epsilons (25 rear/28 front for 15-20 min. TT, 32 
rear/28 front for AX). 
B) Weltmeister springs/anti-sway bar(at max).
C) Konis (at max damp.).
D) Cool Carbon brake pads.
E) DOT4 Brake fluid - (forgot the name, but it is something like "AIR" 
(German).
F) Removed/bypassed rear brake pressure regulators--made very noticeable 
difference,
G) Adjustable spring perches all four corners--lowered car 
3"/corner-weighted.
H) Custom rear shock-tower bar/harness anchor.
I) Installed 1/2" wheel spacers all four corners.
J) Installed ten(!) spring spacers (3/each front, 2/each rear) in the 
Weltmeister springs--this effectively increased the spring rate to over 
1000lb/in F, 500lb/in R--(HUGE difference in handling!  LOVE IT!) 
Recommended, if you have a reasonable flat (not bumpy) track surface.
K) Installed 250 shot of Nitrous. (just kidding)

 Also tried a variety of headers/exhaust mods, with some 
surprising/disappointing results.  Went thru 2 different sets of long 
tube headers with crossover pipes, twin 2.5", single 3.5", Ansa mufflers, 
Borla mufflers, even old fashioned glass-packs.  End result: *STOCK* 
headers with VERY free flowing SINGLE 3" exhaust had the most torque 
between 4100-6000RPM.  That's what I have now, with a SINGLE 3" IN/3" OUT 
Borla racing muffler. I guess the tuning of the Euro-cams/intake assumes 
a certain *velocity* thru the headers to scavenge properly/well...

 Enough,

Marc
