Hello again fellow Land Shark tamers.

First, I want to appologize to all Germans and people of German descent for
my butchered  spelling of "Zwei". Thank you all for the correction.
Henceforth, I will first consult the  dictionary (I was too tired and lazy
to do it on Sunday).

Second, thank you all for you kudos and expressions of gratitude. I received
my greatest reward when more that 80 came to the event and brought nearly 50
928s for me to see. As you know by now, I talk too much, especially
"928eeze".

Third, now that the "party is over" let's not forget to keep the process of
forming a "club" alive. There was alot of talent among you. I encourage you
to channel your strengths and knowledge in ways that will keep in motion the
928 spirit that is within us.

I've got so much to say, but I want to gather my thought in a coheisive
manner before I put them out in cyber-space. Besides, I have to have
something new for you when you come back for "928 Frenzy Zwei".

Happy motoring. Ed
