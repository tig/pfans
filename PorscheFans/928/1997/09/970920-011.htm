Vincent Soo,

Thanks so much for adding a thousand lines or congratulatory messages =
honoring Ferry Porsche. I'm sure that you are being appreciated by =
hundreds of people all over the world for that. This could possible =
result in his eventual canonization.  Saint  Ferry, patron saint of =
funny little cars with engines that try to pass the driver on curves and =
ignition keys that are just right for us few lonely lefthanders. Having =
driven Porsches as long as there have been Porsches I share your =
feelings but hopefully now that you've gone to all the trouble to fete =
him 400 times, the sentiment, extrapolated out to once a year will cover =
us until the year 2391.

With such a mountain of congratulations being heaped on the poor man, =
could'nt you have saved just a few of them for Enzo Ferrari, Carroll =
Shelby, Bruce McLaren,  Augie Duesenberg, Paul Daimler, Ettore Bugatti, =
Jim Clark, Colin Chapman, Zora Arkus Duntov, and Briggs Cunningham, to =
name just a few guys who designed some pretty good cars?

Also, it may interest you to know that you share birthdays with Jeffrey =
Dahmer, Spiro Agnew, Charles Manson, Attilla the Hun, Hitler, Klem =
Kadiddlehopper, and Alfred E. Neuman.  Happy Birthday!

Dr. Bob asked about tire inflation and wear on 928s.  Having driven them =
since they first came out, I've found, at least for me, that if I run =
them a couple of pounds over the factory listed pressures of 36 & 44, =
that they seem to last longer and handle at least marginally better. =
Could be psychological.  Underinflation guarantees frequent trips to the =
tire dealers.  I can't really comment knowledgeably about tire life =
because that depends on your driving type and habits as well as the tire =
brand and running pressure.

I'd say though that as a general rule, unless you burn rubber and drive =
like a squirrel, you should probably get at least twenty thousand miles =
on back tires and a few thousand more on the front.  Depends entirely on =
the weight of your feet.  Same holds true for clutches.  I just had the =
engine out of my car for some top end work and told my mechanic that he =
might as well change the clutch plate as the car has 96k on it.  After =
examining it he said it hardly showed any wear at all, and put the =
original back in.  So that should'nt be a major problem unless the =
previous owner thought he was Paul Tracey or some other bubblehead of =
that ilk.=20

You don't have to baby these cars, but you should check both tire =
pressures and wheel alignment quite frequently.  Wheel alignment has =
always been a 928 bugaboo,  Its' a great suspension system, one that =
Ford is just now copying for some of their cars 20 years after Porsche =
did it, but all it takes to knock it out is that unseen major pothole or =
speed bump.  If in doubt, have at least the front suspension checked, =
it'll only cost a few dollars and may save you the four or five hundred =
that two new front tires will cost, over and above the distinct =
possibility of having an eighty five m.p.h. blowout at two a.m.  67 =
miles outside of South Overshoe, North Dakota.  And try to find a place =
there that stocks 225/50 ZR 16s!
