Well, it looks like we are on for the pelrinage to the Frenzy.  We
should get in fairfax at
8 or 9 depending on my time estimate and time zone changes...

We will be staying at the Courtyard Mariott - Fair Oaks.  Price were
reasonable at $62/night
for 2 of us.

By the way, I understand the explanation on how to remove the electrical
connector for the
nozzle.  I will bring my jewler screwdrivers and a pair of needle-nose
plier.  I hope someone
can give me a hands on help on this one.  I tried for a while but I had
too many thing still
to do to get the car ready for the drive.  (That means that the interior
was put back in a hurry
and the car has not been polished and waxed, so it still is a diamond in
the very rough...)

See you there,
