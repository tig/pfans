<<What about the ZR-1's?  Don't get me wrong; I really like 928's as much

as anyone else on this list, but I know the recent-model ZR-1's have

quite a bit of HP, if I'm not mistaken.  The ZR-1 engine is (I think)

closer in construction (overhead camshaft, 32 valves) to the 928 engine

than to the "standard" Chevrolet 350 motor (pushrod).>>

BUT ... can anyone tell me what company designed the ZR-1's LT-5 engine?
 Nope - -not Chevrolet, it was a small company that relies heavily on
technology and clever design over size - LOTUS.  All this talk about what
type of engine has won Top Fuel drag races and NASCAR events just kind of set
me off.  Answer me this - how many times has a Chevy engine won LeMans?  24
Hours of Daytona?  Mille Miglia?  You can't compare apples to oranges - Chevy
to Porsche.  I think a car company like Porsche (flat air cooled 6), Lotus (4
cyl), Ferrari 348 (207 cu. inch V-8), and Acura (NSX ~ 300 hp 6 cyl.) that
can make a fast car out of a small engine is a lot more impressive than, say,
 a Dodge Viper.  If a car company can't make a fast car out of 488 cu. inches
then they have a problem.  Even though we live in America we on the P-fans
list must remember that there's more to racing than going in circles, more to
going fast than cubic inches, and more to owning a Porsche than just having a
Porsche-shelled Chevy.  No offense to V8 conversion owners ... Just an
opinion.
