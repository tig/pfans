If you want it done right, ...

I did my first autocross Sept. 25th and met listmember Mark DaVia.  A
lot of fun - first run was absolutely hilarious with mucho tail-out, hit
one cone (and went off course once but no spins or tire smoke - you know
who you are).   Great fun!  There were 4 928's there.

Back to alignments, Mark complained that he spent a few hours with a
mechanic and still didn't get the alignment right.  He seemed pretty
interested that I did mine myself and after a few e-mails, we agreed
he'd drive down to us and we spend the day 928'ing (we can make anything
a verb).  Well, I knew another guy in CT who just did Koni's and
Weltmeisters and figured he'd want in on the fun too.  Then one of the
other 928's at the auto-x lived only 5 mi's so we ended up with 4 928's
on my front lawn for the photo op (picture going to Phil soon).

Now the point, we didn't get much done but we did check everyone's
camber.  I checked mine previously and mine were good left to right to
within a few minutes - my car was recently done by the local P dealer
and I had the printout.  ALL the other cars, had a least one axle where
the camber was different by nearly the max 20 minutes difference in the
factory spec (I'm forgetting the specific #'s).  All these guys were
serious enough about track or auto-x to want better than good-enough for
road car alignments and all but Mark trusted the people doing their
alignments (one tech told one owner the camber didn't change after
putting on the weltmeisters).

Additionally, while my car seems to settle quickly, Mark said his takes
a week to settle after jacking.  To get the room to work under the car,
use a couple of 2x4's to set the toe.  I don't believe the camber
changes that much for the last 1/2" of settling (especially if both
sides settle at nearly the same rate, then the side to side difference
won't be much).

FWIW,
Kurt
