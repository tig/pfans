 Which one of the 928 owners that showed up at the VA Frenzy had "Magic Blower
Syndrome"?
Who ever it was must have parked next to my newly restored 79 because now it has
that dreaded disease. ;-(  .
There must be a 24hr incubation period because it started the "old max fan trick
for no reason" the very next day.

In all of the posts that I saw concerning the Magic Blower Syndrome no one
mentioned it was contagious, thanks guys.;o)
 Had I known that I would have gotten it vaccinated before the trip.

Oh well, I guess it is time to change that resistor pack.
