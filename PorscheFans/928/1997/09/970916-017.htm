 Bill,
Let's cut the crap!!

#1 : You said my S4 bumper cover price was too high . I asked you for the
sources of a lower price to pass along to other 928 Fans. You finally responded
with 2 other venders, one of the venders price was $1350 with lights etc, to my
$750 with lights etc. , the other vender was even higher.
You told me you didn't have the time to tell everyone that you were mistaken,
that is your prerogative. In my opinion not very honorable.

#2: We obviously have different techniques for upgrading early 928s to S4 rear
bumpers, that is what makes life interesting.  Just keep in mind, my way of
doing it is reversible without any damage to the sheetmetal or body in any way.
If the next owner wants to switch back it is simple. With your way it would
almost be impossible. This doesn't make yours wrong or mine right. just
different philosophies.

#3 You accuse me of cutting corners. You are the one literally cutting the
corners off of a 928 body.
 I am using my brain to get a better, less damaging, and much less costly way of
converting the S4 bumper with the same factory  techniques used elsewhere on the
928.

#4: As I have told you and others, yes I do this as a hobby and not for the
money which means I care , and I can guarantee that I stand behind everything
that I sell and every bit of technical advise that I give out, ask anyone that
has had any dealings with me. It makes no difference to me if I do this as a
Hobby or do it as a business, I will always be honest, straightforward and above
all HONORABLE to everyone that I sell to or help, especially all of my friends
on the 928 Site.

#5: You say "> Aparently you have difficulty accepting the way the Factory does
things.
> Personally, I prefer to do it their way".
 I challenge you to find anyone who does anything more like the factory than I.
Everything that I recommend and sell to 928 owners is strictly Porsche
standards, or something that doesn't in any way damage or permanently modify a
928. I invite you to come look a both of my 928s and any that I have worked on.
You will find Factory Parts Done To Factory Specs. Take a look out of your
window and look at a 928 with the roof cut off, and you try talk to me about the
FACTORY WAY!!

Yes, everyone has their own opinion and should be able to freely express it, but
if they chose to express that opinion publicly, then they should also be
prepared for someone to express their opinion of your opinion. Of course
opinions are like a%sholes everyone's got one.

Do us all a favor  and check your prices and information about a subject before
blasting
everyone with inaccurate information. Some people do take pride in what they do
and feel very passionate about it, and yes take it very personally especially
when some misinformed person starts crying wolf. and yet doesn't have the honor
to say "oops it was just a collie".


P.S. Thanks for keeping this between us, like it has been the past 24 hrs.. You
are a class act.
