Is anyone else having problems posting messages or has the system just 
taken a dislike to me? This is my third attempt to post the same message 
and I gave up on a couple of others. I get the following message back.

   ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
<928@porschefans.com>

   ----- Transcript of session follows -----

Stupid question really. If I still have problems you will not be reading 
this and if any of you are having the same problems you would not be able 
to "say" so.

"I have another question. The cruise control seems to work initially, but
then just loses speed. I know it's doing something because when I cancel
it the gas pedal returns.  Any ideas?"

This is exactly the same problem I had with my 85 and Stephane is correct 
in that it is almost certainly a vacuum problem. In my case the leak was 
in the heater controls which get vacuum from the same reservoir. From all 
the previous posts on this subject, heater vacuum controls seem to be a 
common problem.
