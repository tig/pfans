"My last car, an Infiniti G20 4-door, was noticably more rigid than the 928."

Have you considered the age difference of the cars? At the time your 928 was
built nobody had even heard of Infinity. When it was new, your 928 might have
been just as stiff as the G20.

I remember a ride in an Infinity Convertible 3 years ago, where I could see
andn feel the body flexing even on a pretty smooth freway. Not a car to
experience a Diana-Style crash in...

The Infinity's owner also had a '78 928 at the time. I think the experience
with the Infinity vs. the 928 (which lasted him 17 years, and 180k miles)
gave him good reasons to stick with German cars (he now owns a Mercedes, a
BMW, and a Boxster...)
