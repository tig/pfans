Gavin,

You were not reading very carefully...I said that Porsche's indy car effort
sucked.  they were as bad or worse than the AAR/Toyota cars are today. (Did
you see PJ Jones throw his steering wheel at Max Papis...LOL at Laguna during
practice...LOL)

I was refering to Brian saying how Porsche engineering is the all out best
and that if they wanted to race Indy they would be winning at it...I was
simply pointing that they tried indy and were terrible at, but if they had
really been dedicated to it and thrown more money at it certainly they would
have been successful.
