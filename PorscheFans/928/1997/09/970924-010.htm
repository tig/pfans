Brian,
Just in case you don't remember or didn't see it, K & N did respond after my
second e-mail when I made them aware that 700+ 928 owners were waiting for an
answer. They said that they would get back to us on the answer. No news as of
yet, and it has been 2-3 months. This seems kind of long for me.
Also I have done my own tests which proved to me that the K & N filters alow a
ton more dust than the factory filters.
