Many of us believe (perhaps arguably) that certain Porsches, including the
911, have  timeless (rather than "old-fashioned") qualities.  Perhaps even a
bland "...enduring tradition..." type comment would have been less insulting
to long time owners.

No.  It is old fashioned.  Maybe also timeless, etc., but still old
fashioned.  But how can we 928 owner's feel sorry for someone's poor car
being insulted, and ours was flat eliminated.  Or terminated.  Or whatever,
but still gone for ever.

Hi,

there is no official speedlimit in Germany, drive as fast as You want:

200, 300 or 400 km/h

the new watercooled 911 makes 280 km/h.

Porsche does not volunterely limit their cars like others (BMW,
Mercedes-Benz) do.

BUT: any accident, that _happens_ to You on our autobahn with Your speed
higher than 130 km/h makes You automatically guilty starting with 30
percent.

Relevant for insurance etc...


greetings from germany,


che

Subject: 912 P-Car

Greetings P-Car enthusiasts,

I have a 1969 912 that has been "restored" to original specs. (Except
for "big bore" kit). It's a wonderful car, fun to drive and gets
exceptional gas mileage. My question is this....I would like to make
some minor improvements to the car. Technology has increased over the
years and I would like to take advantage of this. Since I'm new to all
this, I really would appreciate input on what to do
first.....suspension.....?......engine....?....etc. I want the car to be
a first class 912, not an incomplete 911. 

Regards,
Charles

Mike Wendel has put some of his recent racing photos online at

There are some good Rohr 911 GT1 shots down the Las Vegas PSC GP link.

Subject: Price of a car trailer

I am looking at purchase of tilt trailer to haul a 911.  It
is used, but very sturdy and in good shape.  I can get the
car on it with no trouble and it works fine except it has no
brakes.  Anybody have a feel for what a ballpark price might
be?  The guy had it built for $1400 a few years ago and it
was a good deal then.
