Hello fellow "Land Shark" tamers!

Now that I've had some time to recouperate, let me be among the first to
thank all that came and particularly the Sponsors that supported the event
928 International, DEVEK Performance, and Car Care Specialties. Naturally,
Kim Crumb deserves a big round of applause for the great presentation he
gave.

There was so much covered on the drive train and suspension that we really
did not get a chance to discuss very much about the cockpit area. Larry
Reynold deserves a special thank you for his car care presentations.

I still have lots of "928 Frenzy" Polo Shirts in all sizes except small.
Contact me at: "eds928s.erols.com" to place your order. M & L are $30, XL &
XXL are $32. Please include $5 for shipping and handling. If you live within
a 10 mile radius of Herndon, VA., arrangements can be made to get the
shirt(s) to you without shipping costs. You can call me before 10:00 pm at:
(703)481-9252.

Although I'm still a bit dazed from running the event, I'm already planning
"928 Frenzy Vie" (that's suppose to be "two" in German).

It was a real pleasure for me to meet all of you. I'm sorry that I was not
able to get to know you better. I guess that's something for me to look
forward to at "928 Frenzy Vie".

I hope all that attended enjoyed the event and learned something about the
great cars we drive. If there is anything you would like to add about the
event I would very much like to read or hear it. I'm always looking for ways
to improve what I think was a good event. However, I may be a bit biased
since I put it together. This "emperor" what's to know if his clothes are
transparent. Pardon the cliche.

See you all again at "928 Frenzy Vie" and happy motoring. Ed
.
