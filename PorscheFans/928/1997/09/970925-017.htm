Ahem. Take a look (for this and many other reasons, including its stunning
looks, its ability to contain a driver my size, and its anticipation of the
928's big front engine-rear transaxle layout) at any example of the late
'60s-early '70s Ferrari 356 GTB/4, generally called the "Daytona".

Then rejoice in the fact that Porsche, certainly by the time of the S4, got
the same level of performance into a much more affordable, maintainable,
functional, and comfortable package, still quite good looking.

Then try to figure out why there isn't a rabid market, collectors' or
otherwise, for 928s.
