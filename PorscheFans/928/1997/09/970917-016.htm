I fitted the 18s with BF Goodrich S02 tires. They are supposed to be the
best tires around, well not when it comes to miles per $ though...
Perfect grip, but I had to reset the camber/caster on the back. I don't
know why but I know that the handling was terrible. Maybe it had
something to do with the (much) wider tires back?
The ride is a little harder than before but not like an 911, It's still
acceptable in city traffic.
Looking forward to my coilovers, that will make my car an road iron :o].
