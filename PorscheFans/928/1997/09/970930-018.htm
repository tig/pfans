Hmmm, Does the brake ever let go totally?  If your pad were worn
and the car sat for a while, the caliper piston might have become
pitted (or dirty or ???)  When you put your new pad in, you forced
the piston into the caliper, forcing the "inconsistant piston
surface" (caused by whatever reason) to stick into the seal.  From
there, its a vicious circle, your brake drag a bit, your liquid expands,
the brake locks more, ...

What I would do:

1. Bleed the brake to ensure it was not an air pocket in your line
2. disconnect the line from your master cylinder and the caliper and
blow out the line.  Note if there is any dirt or particle and that the
air can flow both ways (a collapse brake hose can allow fluid to move
in only one direction, similar to a check valve and making your wheel
lock up)
3. Take the caliper apart. The piston can be removed by blowing it out
using compressed air (BE VERY CAREFULL, the piston can pop out like a
bullet.  Place a piece of wood in front of the piston to insure it will
not get ejected onto you or someone else).  Look at the piston contition
and clean everything up perfectly.  IT might be a good idea to purchase
a caliper rebuild kit to change all the seals while you have the thing
apart.  If the piston or the cylinder bore has rust or is pitted, you
might have to change the calipers.

Well, that all I can think of right now.  Good luck from the one
that knows what locking wheels feels like ;-(
