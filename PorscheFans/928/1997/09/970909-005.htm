New Porsche owner here, and my first post.  First the car, 1982 sliver
59k miles, VERY good paint, no dent or scratches Paid $7000 runs VERY
good, only problem is the AC/heater blower, but will address that
later.  My first questions are engine PM.  The oil has always been
change by the PO on schedules, I assume 3k miles. 1.  Its hot here in
Dallas, should I use a straight weight oil or muti-grade, and what
weights, synthetic or regular oil. 2, Should I use an additive, Slick
50, T Plus. 3.  What should my oil pressure be at idle and warm? 4.  I
cannot tell from the owners manual if I have a 16 valve engine or 32, do
know that's it's 220 HP.  I don't want to "hog" space here so will ask
my other question later.  Thank you, great group!

if a cat always falls on his feet and buttered bread always falls butter
side down, what happens if you strap a piece of buttered bread, butter
side up, and throw them out a window?
