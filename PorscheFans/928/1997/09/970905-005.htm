That's too bad because my targets are any drivers driving what they think
to be a fast (quick and nimble) car, even though it isn't a 928.

BB, you missed the point. The point was all about Saturday night, traffic
light to traffic light drag racing. Nothing to do with any 24 hour races.
And if those Saturday night drag racers want to get agressive on a twisty
section of any road, who's gonna blow their doors off? The 450 HP 928 with 
its superb handling.

> You can't compare apples to oranges - Chevy to Porsche. 

Brian, internal cumbustion engines have been and always will be compared to
one another. And in the point that you missed, they will be compared at
every traffic light on every Saturday night!

Remember, I fully understand the splendor and magnifigance of the 928 engine.
I just wanted something with _REAL_ balls. Ah! Very opinionated. _My_
definition of REAL balls is anything over 450 HP and 500ft/lbs of torque.
The cost to get the 928 engine up to my power desires is astronomical in
comparison to the cost to pump a Chevy up to that point. Oops. Apples and
oranges? No. The comparison _must_ be made. It _is_ a feasible solution.

A Devek stroker kit is $7500 in parts. That does not include the other 
typical engine rebuild expense. Face it; one would be an ignoramus if they
were to try to just drop the Devek stroker parts into a 928 motor without
completely rebuilding the rest of the motor (hone the block, new rings, new
gaskets, valve job...).

So...the final cost to get a 928 motor to 450+ HP? Very expensive. Hell, I
could probably buy 2 Lingenfelter engines for the equivalent. There. Now I
can go 200K miles, just like a 928 motor! Oh yeah. All the while, if there
are any problems whatsoever, the cost to repair/replace is at least one
fifth and sometimes upwards of one tenth.

Bill Gates I am not. Therefore, money I cannot ignore!

> Even though we live in America we on the P-fans

But nothing more important than going _faster_ than that Viper from one
traffic light to the next and _THEN_ kicking his ass through the chicane
and around the circle in the middle of downtown!

> more to going fast than cubic inches, 

A 383 isn't all that big and I'm still taking the turns at speed and stopping
on a dime.

> and more to owning a Porsche than just having a Porsche-shelled Chevy.  

And that's why I own another, stone-stock 928.
