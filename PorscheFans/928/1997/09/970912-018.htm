Hey 928ers!,
	I'll share some of my experience with you regarding this rigidity issue
and maybe end this thread. I've been building, modifying, and inspecting
race car (and production-based) chassis for 25 years. Tube (or space)
frame, monocoque, and uni-body designs have all been thru our shops
during this time. Structures are tested--sometimes numerous times thru a
season for rigidity by measuring degrees of deflection vs. applied load
in pounds with a moment arm bolted to the area of interest.
	One constant with any of these structures is that the "interface" where
the load bearing materials join determines retained rigidity. For
instance on a bonded and rivited monocoque structure, degradation occurs
because of a breakdown in the bond-line AND the loosening of rivits. On
a uni-body structure, the first thing any serious constructor does is
strip to the bare shell, and completely weld or braze ALL seams along
their entire length--rather than depend on the factory spot welds to do
the job---again the interface is crucial.
	Our time spent with carbon-fibre/aluminum honeycomb Indy car and IMSA
GTP tubs showed again--that rigidity losses were due to interface or
bond-line degradation---not material property changes.
	On the subject of aluminum (or steel for that matter) losing it's
rigidity over time, it's just not true!. The basic material properties
remain the same unless there is inter-granular corrosion present or if
the material was stressed at one time beyond it's yield strength---and
then usually it just flat fails--breaks--snaps. Surface breaking flaws
or discontinuites,such as cracks or impact damage are called stress
risers and can shorten the life of any component. Don't spray
Brake-Kleen or any other cleaner containing chlorides around non-ferrous
components on your 928--this can lead to corrosion problems and
shortened life.
	Sometimes owners mistake rididity loss with chassis compliance
degradation. The compliant bushings are the culprit here. The factory
fitted bushings are really only good for a few years after leaving the
factory, before they start to soften due to environmental exposure.
Thats why the neoprene or other less compliant materials will do wonders
in improving the handling of any street car, but with a trade-off in
harshness due to vehicle vibration sourced-- or road noise--
transmission.
	And finally, the hood, doors, and rear hatch do not contribute to any
real degree, to the rigidity in a dynamic state (with the exception
being a crash!), on the 928 or any other car. All of these components
are only attached to the structure at three points---two hinges and a
latch. If they were contributing, your mouldings and/or paint would go
away in short order. The inherent rigidity in any structure is a design
element that can be optimized much better with the CAD/CAM technology
available today because of the modeling scenarios that can be tried in
short order as compared to the try it and see methods of the past.

These are my thoughts on the issue. Lets just drive'em--enjoy the car
for what it is, and know that in it's day, it represented a wonderfully
integrated design that few other cars could match. I think the record
shows that the soundness of the car is extreme--just try driving some of
the other exotics out there of similiar vintage and compare for
yourself!!.

Sorry for the length!!--I tend to elaborate!
