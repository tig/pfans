Went to my first P.O.C. event this last weekend and the highlight was the
"big boys' race".

Our very own Mark Anderson was gridded 5th or sixth, behind a 3.8 liter
914-6 with a huge wing and monster slicks, a former European Cup 911 with
carbon fiber 993 bodywork, a superfast white 930 (Saturday's TTOD) with one
of the most exotic bi-level wings anywhere, and assorted other
monstrosities. The pristine white 928 looked a little out of place with its
stock-appearing body work and modest S4 wing.

But by 3 minutes into the race, Mark screamed down the pit straight, dove
inside the 914-6 at turn one, and took the lead. Mark didn't just hold off
the exotics, he opened up space with a flawless performance. The tough
uphill #3 allowed the 914-6 to catch Mark, but in turn 5, Mark started
pulling away, and kept the gap at 5-12 car lengths until the latter part of
8 and into 9. The sight of the stock-looking 928 and the (barely
recognizeable) 914-6 screaming down the pit straight lap after lap had the
crowd gaping.

Meantime, back in the pack another white 930 with major wingage, was
getting everything sorted out and working up through the ranks. Within
another 12 minutes, he made it  a three-way race for first. And of course,
about that time, the leaders started lapping the back markers and it got
sticky. Up until they hit traffic, I clocked Mark at 1:28, and he probably
broke into the 1:27 range (!) If you know Willow, that's fast. If not, it's
2.5 miles, nine turns. Do the math.

By a masterful maneuver, the 914-6 used the slower traffic and got by Mark,
and then the white 930 did too (he eventually went on to win overall).
Unfortunately, in the last minutes of the race, Mark both ran out of gas
and clutch, so he finished 5th or 6th (Mark, correct me on any of the
details I'm fuzzy on).

But there are at least 100 P.O.C. members with a newly-renewed respect for
the prowess of the 928.

Great driving, Mark!
