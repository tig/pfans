My 85 had a broken Y connector too, and it took a
while to find that leak, and the source of the gas odor.
If you have the shop manual, or access to it, it helps alot
to see the whole emissions diagrams.  I don't have them here,
but I'll try to recall from archived storage.

3.   Yes, I notice no more gas fumes, and can't really say for certain 
     on performance, maybe a little more snap, but I'm pretty snappy
     already! Get the Y, it cost me 
     $4 cdn from local Pcar dealer.  The Y connects a vent hose from
     the gas tank, to a regulator (smaller hose), and the charcoal
     cannister.  The regulator functions to purge the fumes into the
     intake system.  Very Clever.

4,5. There should be a hose coming from the charcoal cannister
     (the luft port) through the well to the underside of
     the air cleaner housing.  Get This Fixed IMMEDIATELY.  The
     underside of the air cleaner goes directly to intake, bypassing
     air filter.  Nasty.
