Jim,
I bought my rebuilt water pump from the late Jay Pineau in Houston. 
Unfortunately, these are not available. I don't know the quality of other 
rebuilts. Doing a water pump is not a super difficult job, but it does require
a lot of time (for a 1st timer) and the use of the belt tensioner tool and a 
flywheel lock as the only special tools.

The tensioner tool is about $300-400! So borrow one or set the belt as close as 
it was when you took it off. Then carefully drive directly to a competent shop 
to set the tension. The flywheel lock is about $20.

As Vince says check the tensioner boot, tensioner roller, and water pump roller.
You'll want to replace the timing belt. Also, check the bearings on the fan 
clutch. Mine were dry and starting to grind. A friends 928 fan bearings failed
(we think), the fan exploded taking the radiator, belts, hoses, and made some 
nice dents in the hood! 

From what I've heard about the 928 being a non-interference engine, only the 
US spec 2V engines are. This should cover '78-'84 US 928s.

Hope this helps,
