I have posted this before (months back probably) But I thought I would =
post it again.

A friend of the family races corvettes, and belongs to several corvette =
clubs etc. He decided that he goes through so much rubber, that he could =
start selling tires out of his garage to other corvette club members. So =
now he is a distributor for yokohama. It worked out so well money wise, =
he decided to become a distributor for K&N. Anyway, along with all of =
the product specs he gets, he goes to seminars and company talks. When I =
asked him if the higher levels of dust in the oil when using K&N was =
true, he said yes, but had a half hour spiel ready to explain why it was =
not important.

The synopsis is this: although there are higher levels of small dust =
particles in the oil, they are of such a minute nature that they are =
finer than even the pores of your cylinder wall. Because a microscope =
can see them does not mean that they will damage your engine.

He is very adamant about K&N - he talked about the benefits, not only =
for his two vettes (85 and 97', neither anywhere close to stock) but for =
his Chevy tow vehicle as well. (Im not much of a chevy man so forgive me =
if I dont remember what kind of truck it was, it was big...)
Anyway, he stated the benefits like this - When a K&N filter is new, it =
is already 15% better than a new paper filter. But after 30k miles, even =
without doing any of the inexpensive maintenence on the K&N, the K&N is =
STILL 12% better than a new paper filter, and 40% better than a paper =
filter with 30k miles on it.

He does take care of his vehicles, and he is quite a sharp guy, so if =
K&N fooled him its too bad. But he stands by his filters (and doesnt =
sell them except to his friends and fellow club members, so its not a =
sales thing for him).
In fact - one year he had taken his 97' up to ely nevada to run in the =
170mph class. unfortunately because of a minor problem in the chevy head =
design, there was a pool of water drowning some of his starting =
electricals. (I dont know the details of this, only that after a few =
days of searching, they found the pool of water, and consulted chevy who =
had them drill a drainage hole to fix the problem)
Anyway, as his vette was out of the count for the race, and he had come =
all that way, he unloaded his truck and ran IT in the 120mph class =
instead. I think he came in second, with no practice and no preparation.
