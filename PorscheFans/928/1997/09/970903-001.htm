I get it a lot. I bought my 928 not just because it's shiny and has a
Porsche badge on the front, but because it's a fabulously engineered car
that is an absolute joy to drive.

Usually when I meet up with people with the "attitude", I quiz them on what
car they own. 9 times out of ten they have a fairly new car that actually
cost them more than my 928 cost me. When they find that out, they tend to
put their tails between their legs and retreat in embarassment.

Cheers,
