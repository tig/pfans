>Subject: Brake upgrade question

>Three questions about brakes on an 86 928S(has the S4 upgrade):

>1) Is it as easy to change the brake rotors on the 928 as my VW Golf
>(two bolts and a screw)?

On my '86 S, US Spec, I replaced the front pads in about 30 minutes,
without removing anything.  There is a clip on the front of the caliper that
you have to "squeeze" with a pair of pliers to remove, then just pull the
pads out through the top of the caliper.  I opened the brake fluid reservoir
to relieve pressure, so that when I tried putting the new pads in, I was
able to push the piston in. 

>2) Do you have to change the pads when you change rotors?

I would not want to use worn pads with new rotors.  If the whole caliper
has to come out to replace the rotor, why not replace the pads at the
same time.  Also, the wear pattern on the pad is going to be uneven, on a
very smooth new rotor, speeding up the uneven wear on the rotor.


>3) Can you replace the vented with drilled&vented? If so, from who?

I have mixed feelings about this.  The larger the surface, the more heat it
can dissipate, right?  So if you have a drilled rotor, you effectively
reduce the surface.  Having said that, I see those rotors used in some
race applications, I wonder if they are larger?  The look incredibly cool
though.

>Thanks
