  Gaskets/seal are probably going to be dried out from lack of use on a car
  this age (BTDT).  In particular, watch the brake master cylinder; if it
  isn't leaking now, it may if you pressure flush the brake fluid.  
  Also listen for vacuum leaks around the air flow meter/throttle body and
  throttle body/mounting base connections.  Both of these are sealed by
  large rubber O-rings which tend to shrink and crack with age.
  
  I had heard bad things about Prestone a few years back, so I haven't
  used it since.  The problem had something to do with the antifreeze
  attacking aluminum, but they may have changed the formula to rectify
  that by now.
