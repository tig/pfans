OK, I phoned my local (350 miles distant) Canadian Porsche dealership
and queried the parts manager. I've spoken to this person a number of
times and he has always proved very efficient, knowledgeable and
helpful. This time, not so much. According to him, Canadian dealers are
in exactly the same boat as US dealers (both fall under PCA). Since
Porsche never intended the EuroSpec cars for the North American market,
they are unwilling to support any Euro-only deviations from the US type
cars in either Canada or the US. The dealers have no way of knowing the
part numbers for Euro-only options, or even if they did, would have no
way of ordering the parts. The only suggestion he had was to contact an
overseas supplier.

If I was to move to Germany for a couple of years, buy a new Porsche,
then move back to Canada with my car, I would be out of luck if a
Euro-only option or part failed - even under warranty. I would be one
P.O.'d customer..... (As in Previous Owner).
