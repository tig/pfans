<fontfamily><param>Arial</param>Another subject:  Insurance.  Maybe some
of you guys should check out GEICO if they operate  in your state.  I
have full coverage on my 87S4 including collision,  comprehensive, glass
damage, acts of war, uninsured motorist, and tsunami  damage.  I pay
840.00 per year with no mileage  limitations.</fontfamily>

<paraindent><param>left</param>Now on the serious side.


What bothers me about GEICO is that they donate thousands of dollars to
supply police departments with radar & lidar units.  Only one reason
why...so they can raise premiums when you get tickets.


</paraindent>Then they also wanted reject coverage of motorist that used radar
detectors because they were used to break the law.  Well someone or some
journalist went to GEICO's employee parking lot and found that a lot of
them had detectors in them.  After some debate, (a lot of help from Radio
Association Defending Airwave Rights - RADAR Inc.), they were forced to
drop that BS.
