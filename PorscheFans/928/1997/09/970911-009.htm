Please note the caveat in my initial post, "...IN A CAR DESIGNED FOR RIGIDITY
IN THE FIRST PLACE..."  No convertible "chop top" qualifies!  The Infiniti
convertible was a not-particularly-good-in-the-first-place Japanese domestic
market-only "boulevardier" model brought in as an Infiniti convertible merely
as a stop-gap to fill the Q45-only Infiniti product line when the brand was
launched (ditto the small G20 4dr sedan, which was a much newer design
specifically created as Nissan's entry to the Euro market and assembled in a
new English factory).
 
Yes, the 928 is a particularly good example of pre-CAD/supercomputer
structural design, even given the inherent rigidity problems of its design
(huge non-structural hatch opening; the way its stability-inducing front
engine/rear transaxle layout concentrates masses where they have the greatest
deleterious effect on both torsional and longitudinal rigidity; the huge door
openings' design give access to the useless rear "seats," etc.).
 
Nonetheless, I reiterate my assertion that NO pre-CAD/supercomputer designed
structure will have the rigidity of a design using modern design technology
but sharing the same "maximum rigidity" design goals.

P.S.
Thanks to all who suggested potential fixes to my post-repaint electrical
glitches!
