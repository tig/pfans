Being that video is my business, I've mounted a small camera head on my
front spoiler and ripped down the highway at about 130!  It's a pretty neat
view since the camera is only a few inches off the pavement!  Also, when
you pull up to a stop light behind another vehicle, you can check out the
under side of their car/truck!  Also, since it's so far up front, when you
DO come to a stop behind another vehicle it looks like you're going to hit.
