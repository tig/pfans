  I wouldn't say that _everyone_ is concerned about the ($) value of their
  cars.  Obviously one would be concerned about the value if and when the 
  decision is made to sell the car, but there are many among us, myself 
  included, who purchased the 928 _without_ considering the potential resale 
  value at some point down the road.  I'm probably a bit odd in that I tend to 
  subscribe to a "buy and hold" philosophy when it comes to cars, but I always
  do enough research months in advance of a purchase to know that the vehicle
  I'm going to buy is one that will continue to provide driving enjoyment 
  until the day it wears out.  My problem tends to be one more concerned with 
  where to store them all...

  In John's case, I certainly considered the seller, a used car salesman,
  and that seller's potential (lack of) knowledge of the car when I made my 
  statement.  I would venture to guess that most car dealers see a Porsche 
  and immediately start to see $$$.  In the case of that particular 928
  with 105K miles sitting on a used car dealer's lot, I felt the price
  was too high simply because the dealer thought he could get away with it
  due to the marque.  Some '84 928s probably would justify a $14K price
  tag, but I'll bet that those would be sold by an individual who had 
  invested a lot of their own time, money, and effort in properly caring 
  the car.

  There probably isn't another 1984 car that you could buy that would
  give as much driving pleasure as the 928.  But for $12-$14K, a 928 S4
  would certainly give _more_ pleasure AND a better horsepower/brakes/
  refinement per dollar value.

  The parts don't get cheaper just because the car is getting older.  Bummer...

> So here's the question: is the current low market pricing on 928s fair?

  Fair?  Given the capabilities of the car and the vault-like build quality,
  the market pricing certainly doesn't seem fair.  But to be honest, I want
  a GT to park next to my S, so I guess I really don't want _fair_ market
  pricing.  I think the fact that "those who know" can get such an incredible
  machine for such a pitance is the real "value" of a 928.
