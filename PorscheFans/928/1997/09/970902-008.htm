I have received great info on Eurofication. Thanks to all. I have also
recieved this question enough to post the answer.

This is a guy who advertises in Hemmings under P-Parts "parting out Porsche
928, whole cars". I have bought quite a varied selection of parts from him
and he always offers great help to go with stuff you buy. He can be a
little hard to get in touch with so be patient. It will be worth your wait.

Phone number is 508 224 3109.
