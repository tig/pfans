Paul,
I just went through this on my 79. There seemed to be 2 problems, one the hood
shocks were so old and worn they were not operating smoothly and "catching", the
other problem was the hood hinges needed lubrication.
The only way I could get the hood up at first (without folding it in half) was
to get a friend to lift up on the back edge of the hood at the windshield while
I lifted from the front (normal ) position. This seemed to take some of the
pressure off of the hinges and allowed it to open easier.  I first thought I
needed new hinges but they didn't seem to be loose and worn out, so I lubed with
Mobile 1 synthetic spray lube, replaced hood shocks and it now works smooth as
glass!!
