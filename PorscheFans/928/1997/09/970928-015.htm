Aye.  A major tip of the hat to Ed - he put together an excellent event!  I
could tell that everybody was getting wound up about their sharks.  I also
learned more about my 928 in that one day than I ever expected to.  Kim
Crumb was very approachable and forthcoming with information.  I'm sure that
he and Ed were exhausted from being peppered with questions all day...

Thanks Ed!
