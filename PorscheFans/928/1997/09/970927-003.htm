Steve , I am not autocrossing my car yet but in prep for it I installed 
progressive rate Weltmeisters on my 84, (you need rear adapters) and Koni Reds 
with 2 1/2 turns from Paragon systems out of TX. I put Yokohama 0032R's very 
soft rubber on and the car sticks like glue.  The springs and shocks were well 
worth it, as was my K&N filter despite the recent thread on dust.   My next 
step is a s4 brake upgrade and a new exhaust set up.

..My question to the group is, first to second and third to second on my 5sp is 
terrible, and I have driven other pre 86s with the same grinding when trying to 
shift to fast in the lower gears at higher rpms.  Is there a fix or do I buy a 
newer transaxle?  The car has 74k on it and

Old 928's never die we just make them go faster.
  An 84 928 S stick black/black and slightly enhanced.
