Are you really sure that the electric fan doesn't work? The fan is controlled
by a relay, which in turn is controlled by a pair of sensors: a coolant
temperature switch and a refrigerant temperature switch. My experience
has been that the fan only runs in hot weather when the air conditioning
has been on for a while. Which probably means that my coolant doesn't
get hot enough to close the sensor. 

In any case the fan shouldn't cause the engine to run hot on the highway;
the natural airflow through the radiator should be sufficient, and
the fan just gets in the way. First thing to do is just install some
fresh antifreeze. PCNA told me that the 5 year Prestone stuff was OK
several years ago, and it seems to have been OK in my car. And when
you change the antifreeze, be sure to drain the block as well as the
radiator. There's about a gallon of coolant in there, along with who
knows what collection of crud that you really don't want to pollute
the nice new coolant with. Make sure you get some fresh new washers
for the drain plugs (crushable aluminum, like the one in the oil
drain but smaller).
