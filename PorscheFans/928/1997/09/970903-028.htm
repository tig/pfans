Mine is leaking also. And, yes, the bolts are loose. I just tighten as many of
them up as best I can. I've talked to a mechanic on replacing the gasket. He 
said the engine needs to be lifted up. His shop has built a harness to do this.
What I what to know is what else should we do While You're In There (WYIT)
and the engine is raised? New motor mounts, headers...
