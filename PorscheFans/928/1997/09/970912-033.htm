As most of you know, Radar detectors are illegal to use in VA. However, they
are not illegal to own. Before entering into the Commonweath of VA the
detectors are suppose to be removed from where they can be used while
driving. That is the way I understand the ordinance. Some  State Troopers
and I am told a few Fairfax County Cruisers have Radar detector detectors.
Having a stealth unit that can be detected will not save you from a ticket.
Please be advised.

The nearest and good quality hotels with reasonable rates are: Fair Park
Marriot at $70-80 per night for Fri.& Sat., The Hampton Inn in Fairfax City
@ $82 per nite, The Wellesley Inn on Route 29 near Route 123 is about $75
per nite, and the Holiday Inn on Route 123 near Route 29 for $99 per nite.
The Marriot and the Hampton are rated 3 diamonds by AAA. The others are 2
diamonds.

Happy motoring. Ed
