Should I tell you about being the first car, in a four car accident, with 
driver number four doing 26 thousand dollars worth of damage to the other three 
cars.  And having only 10 thousand worth of insurance.  I lost my 500 dollar 
deductible as did the other three people involved in this mess.  Everyone but 
driver of car four had a new or expensive car with collision on it.
PS even though he is liable for our deductible he is refusing to pay, so we are 
making a trip to small claims court to recover this money.  Mainly because it 
turns out he is an insurance agent, and wrote his policy for the least 
insurance you can carry in this state, as well as never reporting the accident 
to his insurance company so it took all of us an extra 3 months to get this 
resolved.

My car is insured for about 7k of Californian pleasure miles per year - and
to add the collision would have added close to $ 600 in 6 months - or 1200
per year. Now comes the simple math: If someone pays this for the 50 years
he/she might drive in his/her life, it totals to $ 60k. For that money I
could total 3+ cars of a value equivalent to my 928. Is it likely that I
would total 3 or more cars in that time? (I'd probably be dead after the
first or second...)

Old 928's never die we just make them go faster.
