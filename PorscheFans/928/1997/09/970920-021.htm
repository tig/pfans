I'M NEW AT THIS, AND I HAVE ONLY HAD MY '90 928SINCE LAST NOV'96, SO
PLEASE OVERLOOK ANY OBVIOUS DOUMB STATMENTS AND SPELLING.

I LIVE IN THE COUNTRY, AND AFTER 20 YEARS THE ROAD IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE
AND DOWN THE HIWAY HAS BEEN PAVED. TO SAY THE LEAST, 4" OF ROAD
CLEARENCE IS NOT A REAL COMFORT TO ME. WHEN I BOUGHT MY 928, THE BELLY
COVER HAD BEEN CHEWED UP PRETTY BAD, THE FIBERGLASS HAD HOLES IN IT, AND
ONE FRONT MOUNT TAB WAS MISSING, AND HELD UP WITH A TYWRAP. I SET TO
WORK CHANGING THE OIL, A SURPRISE IN IT'S SELF (ANOTHER STORY), TRYING
TO REBUILD, AND PUT THE BELLY COVER BACK ON. I'VE HAD TO TIGHTEN UP AND
REPLACE SCREWS SEVERAL TIMES DUE TO VIBRATION FROM ROUGH ROADS, AND I'M
GETTING TIRED OF MESSING WITH IT. I'VE REPLACED SOME SCREWS WITH LARGER
ONES, PUT IN PLASTIC ANCHORS WHERE I COULD, PUT RUBBER SPACERS UNDER
WASHERS TO DAMP THEM, AND ON AND ON. I KNOW WHY ITS THERE, BUT THE TEXAS
ROADS ARE TAKING A TOLL ON IT AND ME. IS THERE ANY ONE WITH A GOOD FIX,
OR OTHER SUGGESTIONS, TAKING IT OFF BEING ONE!

OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS.
