Congratulation!!  Just a word of caution for whoever wants to do their
own brake.  Take your time!!  You want to make sure that the job is
done right for the next time you will need to stop.  A brake job is
very simple but should be taken seriously (sorry for the sermon but I
want to make sure we do not loose a listmember in the process...)

Only available through the secret service or other intense militia group
accross the good old US of A.  Also standard equipment on black UN 
helicopters. (I had to lighten the tone from the previous sermon)
