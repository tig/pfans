Thomas,

Good info - can you roughly describe how it's done.  I'm guessing it's pret=
ty much the same as the way I figured out.
You can cc a reply to the list as well - I'm guessing some will be interest=
ed in the info.
Best,
Kurt



Kurt,

Yeah,  the "Hit Man" system is very similar in concept to your method, exce=
pt you don't need to do a lot of calculations.  Here's a quick synopsis of =
how it works:

You get two (about 5"diameter) steel disks in the kit which you attach to t=
he wheels. (This takes adapters or some ingenuity)  Then you attach to each=
 disk a magnetic scope holder.  This scope holder is basically a piece of P=
VC pipe with notches at one end to hold the scope, and a magnetic base at t=
he other end.  There's also a circular bubble level in the holder with conc=
entric calibrations for a quick check of camber (1/4, 1/2, 1, 1 1/2 degrees=
, etc.)  This holder is precision made so all surfaces are true, and this c=
an be checked by flipping it around the other way and checking readings.

There are two (rather cheap plastic) rifle scopes in the kit which clip on =
to the ends of the holders in the "V" notches.  (Kurt, I like your idea of =
the lasers, they'd substitute perfectly for the scopes)  There are also two=
 targets which you place out either 25 or 50 ft. from the wheel centers.  T=
hey are marked with calibrations for 50ft.  For 25ft, you just double the n=
umbers.  You sight through the scope onto the target and read your toe sett=
ing.  Of course there's a lot of measuring and set up that I've left out, b=
ut the kit comes with pretty good instructions (not great instructions thou=
gh).  =


There's also a way to check camber precisely and another target for checkin=
g caster.

I made a lot of measurements of the bottom suspension points on my car, and=
 found the exact centerline front to back.  I then attached small screw eye=
s to the underside along this line.  Now, whenever I want to do an alignmen=
t, I just hang a plumb bob from each screw eye and run a string down the le=
ngth of the car and out in front 25 feet.  I use this centerline to set up =
my targets.  This helps insure that all four wheels are going straight ahea=
d and not "dog tracking".

I've left a lot out, but if anyone would like to know more, I'll be happy t=
o provide any other insight I can.
