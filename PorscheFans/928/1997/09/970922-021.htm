Patrick,

Thanks for clarifying my memory of your post.  I apologize for the
implications and I'm glad to see you don't condone dangerous contests. 
At the end of the day, I think this mostly comes down to different
tastes - since I always seem to be $ challenged, I find working on the
driver to be more rewarding than spending $ on the engine.  BTW, it
still sounds like yours is a speed competition (or quickness) and so
some (insurance companies and local law enforcement) could in principle
challenge you on the legality.

On track versus street, I usually find I don't really like the attitude
of the people wanting to challenge me on the street.  I'm pretty sure if
you point a video camera at some people and then trounce them, they
might point something more effective back at you so you might want to
carefully choose your opponents.  At the track on the other hand, I've
met a total of maybe 5 people who wouldn't come over and give you a
congrat's and talk for 5 minutes after you "beat them" (928's seem to be
a really good car for this).  Another is that you can close up on people
through a turn within a couple of yards being extremely confident they
won't brake check you.  Good fun, good people, and not terribly
dangerous.  It's not that these are better people because they own
Porsches, but they've either been approved after being trained by PCA
instructors or they still have an instructor riding with them (whom you
do not disobey).  If you really like competition, you get to see how
well you compare against some pretty good drivers (and how they do
things) - this is of course expected to be very humbling (and that's not
so bad when you're going 100+).  This is perhaps another taste thing,
but I just don't get a whole lot out of trouncing some yuck on the
street.  Being able to almost stay with people in a white run group is
really fun while I'm doing it and very satisfying afterwards.  There's a
ton more to learn, but we are learning!

There's one well-publicized downside to track events - they're
addictive.  If you haven't done one, do so but be warned.

Kurt

too-technical directions for how to get to Mars <grin>.)
