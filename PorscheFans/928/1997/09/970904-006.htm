Since I've owned my 78 I have not been able to make it pass smog. The car
misfires at low to mid rpms (980-1700). Not only that but the hydrocarbon
readings are off the scale.
I took it to my mechanic 3 weeks ago, and they have gone through every
test they can think of (exept one test I wanted him to do, the
compression test, he keeps saying - if I cant figure it out we WILL do it
but you NEVER see that problem on 928s).
What they believe now is that my catalytic converter is bad - they say
the hydrocarbon reading is actually higher after the cat than it is
before. They think the backpressure it is causing is causing me to miss
(Until I really get flowing) - And they recommended me to another shop
that can weld in a high performance universal cat legally for $250.

I trust you guys more than I trust my mechanic at this point. Although I
dont have any reason to distrust him, I really want my car back asap and
would appreciate any input. PS - another person i spoke with said that 
the CD unit could cause that problem (capacitive discharge?) - What are
your thoughts on that?
