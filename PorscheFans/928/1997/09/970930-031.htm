Anyone have any idea's on this one. I have a noise on my 85 auto that 
sounds for all the world like a loose heat shield or some other piece of 
metal banging around. It seems to be coming from the area where the motor 
connects to to torque tube but with sound transmission through solids 
being what they are this could be deceptive. Its not there all the time 
but is most noticeable when the car is first started from cold and is 
running a little less smoothly than it should. Yes I will fix my cold 
start one day but that's an on going saga that seems to be part of my 
life now. It also seems to be less prevalent when the car is in gear but 
this might just be a resonance thing. There is also a kind of groan which 
sounds very much related when the motor is turned off. The torque tube 
bearings were done about 8 or 9k miles ago, is it possible they left 
something loose in there? I don't have the same trust in the company that 
did the work as I did at one time and don't want to go back to them. It 
doesn't sound like a bad bearing but who knows. Wouldn't a bad bearing 
proclaim itself as such all the time though? After a quick look under the 
car it looks like there's a cover plate that just might be removable 
without pulling the exhaust etc and I might be able to get access. There 
is a little rubber stopper there as well and peering in the hole with a 
flashlight I can see where the torque tube is connected to the crank with 
a clamp. I would sure like to get a wrench on it and put my mind at rest.

Any and all thought would be appreciated.

PS I might get round to measuring my fuel pressure this weekend. Anyone 
know where the measurement point is. I had a quick look in the dark last 
night a didn't see it. I assume its on one of the fuel rails.
