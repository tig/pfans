<<Anyway, to get to

the point, I have an employee with a 2 year old 5.0 mustang GT 5 speed who

talked me into a little drag race.  We have a service road leaving the shop

that is a 1/2 mile long. ( I dont want to get yelled at for endangering

lives) and to make a long story short, we both had a clean run ( no excuses

like missed a shift or had my floormat wadded under my throttle bla bla bla)

.......My almost 20 year old car , bone stock, flat kicked the V8 mustangs

butt.  >>

That's the way I expected it to happen.  As did almost everyone else, I am
sure.  If the other guy that thinks he can beat either a 240HP, or the 288HP,
928 with a v6 mustang would simply look down to his right as he sits in the
driver seat, he would notice that the little lever needs to be in D not N.
 And in case you really want to go, try 1 or 2 depending on what the car is
equipped with.
