Fred Rau's excellent article is at:

Note that short-term success says nothing about long-term effects, as
noted in his article.

Here's a clip....

The Infamous "No Oil" Demo 

At at least three major motorcycle rallies this past year, we have
witnessed live demonstrations put on to demonstrate the effectiveness of
certain oil
additives. The demonstrators would have a bench-mounted engine which
they would fill with oil and a prescribed dose of their "miracle
additive."
After running the engine for a while they would stop it, drain out the
oil and start it up again. Instant magic! The engine would run perfectly
well for
hours on end, seemingly proving the effectiveness of the additive which
had supposedly "coated" the inside of the engine so well it didn't even
need
the oil to run. In one case, we saw this done with an actual motorcycle,
which would be rid den around the parking lot after having its oil
drained. A
pretty convincing demonstration - until you know the facts. 

Since some of these demonstrations were conducted using Briggs and
Stratton engines, the Briggs and Stratton Company itself decided to run
a
similar, but somewhat more scientific, experiment. Taking two brand-new,
identical engines straight off their assembly line, they set them up for
bench-testing. The only difference was that one had the special additive
included with its oil and the other did not. Both were operated for 20
hours
before being shut down and having the oil drained from them. Then both
were started up again and allowed to run for another 20 straight hours.
Neither engine seemed to have any problem performing this "minor
miracle." 

After the second 20-hour run, both engines were completely torn down and
inspected by the company's engineers. What they found was that both
engines suffered from scored crankpin bearings, but the engine treated
with the additive also suffered from heavy cylinder bore damage that was
not
evident on the untreated engine. 

This points out once again the inherent problem with particulate oil
additives: They can cause oil starvation. This is particularly true in
the area of
piston rings, where there is a critical need for adequate oil flow. In
practically all of the reports and studies on oil additives, and
particularly those
involving suspended solids like PTFE, this has been reported as a major
area of engine damage.
