Stephane,

I wasn't referring to paint loss due to flexing, as much as I am
referencing the loss due to abrasion and fretting against another
painted surface at the panel edges.. You sometimes see this when a car
has been improperly repaired after an accident and the body panels are
not properly aligned. Usually on a hood or a rear hatch where the panel
gaps(i.e. fenders to hood) are smaller to minimize air ingress. If the
bodyman was REALLY bad or the guy on the frame machine, you might also
see the inconsistent gaps on the doors. It comes down to small movements
of the main structure can move the unibody up against these other panels
when the vehicle is dynamically loaded--the gaps are there as a "buffer
zone" , and inferior-engineered cars have larger gaps.. Porsche uses
tight tolerances on these panel alignments because the inherent
stiffness of the main structure and supplimentary bracing allows them to
do so.
	The hood,doors, and hatch are "along for the ride"--and cannot
contribute to overall vehicle rigidity because they do not have a
interface in intimate contact with the main structure---only point
attachment.
	This is why you see Stock car racers climbing thru the window opening
to get in/out. They weld the door panels to the main structure to
stiffen up the car a bit and the hood and rear deck panels are made up
of as light a material as possible---there only to direct airflow over
the body.

Hope that clears up things a bit.

Best regards,

Mike McLaughlin
