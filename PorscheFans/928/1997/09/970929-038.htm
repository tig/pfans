Hello All,

I though I would relate this past Sunday's autocross to all you 928 fans
out there.  

First off, Kurt Gibble and I drove my 1984 euro spec 928 S to the
frenzy, a total of just under 1000 miles.  The very next day we both
went to an autocross in the town I live in.

Kurt arrived at my place in his 87 S4 and we proceeded to the Corvettes
United autocross in Thompson, CT at the Thompson Speedway.  This is a
very fast event by autocross standards, speeds over over 80mph were
reached by Kurt.  But of course!  It's put on by the Corvette Club! 
This autocross is very different because it uses the banked corners,
front and back straights, as well as the infield.  There is little room
for mistakes, as the whole track has retaining walls, as most do.  

A total of 79 showed up, about 35 were Corvettes.  Some notable cars
that were there was a new C5 Corvette on R1s, a 993 TT on streets, a 993
on R1s, and two cart type things (one cart thing had a 914 engine and
tranny, and the other a 1000cc GPZ Kawa engine).  There were many full
blown race cars and autocross cars there, too.

My car has R1s, 116,000 miles, Z-rated Performance Friction brake pads
from Devek, a K&N air filter, and an automatic transmission!  Kurt's 87
S4 has R1s, lower springs, 80 compound Perf. Friction pads, and a 5spd.

These are the standing at the end of the day!  I drove my car to beat 73
of the 79 cars, only to be beat by the two carts, and two other cars. 
The two other cars were both on R1s and had clean runs, meaning that
they didn't hit any cones, and therefore had no penalties.  One driver
is the G/S SCCA Solo II 1997 National Champion, and had a time of
2:03:95.  The other driver was in a Mazada RX7 TT and he turned a time
of 2:04:35.  My time was 2:04:83, but I had a two second penalty.  And
no, it was not a "hit the cone to gain time" penalty, it was a "tail-out
and waste time by sliding" penalty!

If I had a clean run I would have had the fastest time of all the cars
that raced!  Note I said cars, not cars and carts.  The carts were 20
seconds faster.  FTD went to the 1000cc GPC, he also is the B/M SCCA
Solo II National Champion!

Kurt did very well with beating 61 of 79, with a time of 2:09.??. 
Fantastic for his SECOND autocross!

Needless to say, the Corvette Club members are not very fond of 928
drivers!!  I beat every Corvette there, including the C5 and a ZR1!

I think our cars are underestimated, and I think this event proved that
to 78 drivers!
