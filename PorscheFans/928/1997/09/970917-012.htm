Jerry,

This is a common problem among 928's that have been aligned by some national
tire place (nee. NTW for me).  They do not understand that the car needs to
be driven about 10 miles w/ much heavy braking to get the front end to settle
back into position after the car has been jacked up.

So they go ahead and do the alignment w/o doing the above and low and behold
the numbers are WAY off once the car settles donw and you wear out the inside
edges of the front tires...especially the left front (at least that is the
way is has been for everyone I have talked to so far).

Get new tires for the front at least (if they are still pretty new take them
back to the dealer but don't let him do the alignment), then find a competent
928 mechanic to do a proper alignment.

Hope that helps,
