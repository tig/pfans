Thanks for the ideas.  I don't think it's a dirty switch.  That would 
be intermittant with little or no consistancy (plus, I've cleaned it 
and it still behaves the same).  I don't think we had the system to 
roll the window up with the door lock in 84 but I'm not positive.  
Can anyone confirm this???

TIA
