TO: 
All 928 people with access to fenders and associated parts:

Yesterday, I was online looking for a set of headlights and wheels;  I had
no idea I'd be needing this netowrk so soon again, as I have just this
morning been involved in an accident with my 1985 Porsche 928S, and I'm
going to need the following parts:

1]  replacement right front fender.  I would like to try and find a used
one if I can, and it must be in absolutely perfect condition;

2]  right-hand amber turn signal;

3]  right-hand black foglight/signal light surround. 

If any of you have access to reliable source of parts, could you please fax
a quotation for the price of the above parts [inclusive of shipping to
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada], to my fax number as listed above, or email me a
note.  Thanks for your help in this. 

  
Yours truly,

Dave Jorgensen
