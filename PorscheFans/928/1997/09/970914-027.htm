Thanks for that.

I went searching under the engine yesterday and decided that Porsche
couldn't have put the sender unit in a more difficult place to get to.

I haven't worked on my own car since I raced Austin Mini's about 10 years
ago. I've still got a good collection of tools, but no jack. I can see I'll
have to get some car ramps as well, or maybe build an inspection pit into
my barn.

Just thinking about it, the farmer next door might have a suitable jack I
can borrow.

Anyway, I did some more investigating.

My 928S isn't starting first pop at the moment, but after about a second of
cranking, the pressure gauge startts to visibly rise, then hits the full
scale. This is before the engine even fires. If I switch off straight away,
the needle stays on full scale for a few minutes before I hear a click from
the meter and it drops back down to zero.

I pulled the right hand connector off the instrument panel and hooked a DVM
to the cable. The oil sender appears to supply 120mV while the ignition is
on but engine not running. When started it goes down to 85mV. The wierd
thing is, when I shut off the ignition, it goes to -30mV before slowly
returning to zero.

Looks as though the sender's not working properly and is causing the meter
to jam on full scale.

Once I get sufficient access to the sender unit, I'll clean the connections
as you suggested and see what happens.
