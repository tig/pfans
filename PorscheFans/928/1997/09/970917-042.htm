Hello again Land Shark tamers:
Excuse me posting twice in one day, but I was asked to remind you that the
deadline for the event at $5 for PCA members and $10 for non-members ends on
9/20/97. Let me clear that up a bit. Any registration received post marked
after 9/20/97 will be considered late. At check-in,  late registrants will
be required to pay an additional $10. You have till this Saturday to get
your registration in on time. DO NOT DELAY! This is you last advisory.

Also, thanks to all that said they would help at the event so that I would
not have to be too busy to enjoy it. As busy as I think 'll be, I still
expect to have a blast.

Once again, happy motoring. Ed
.
