Started having cold start problems with my '85 1/2 32v "S", chip and 
performance headers. Last month we replaced the battery with a Sears Diehard 
after weak starter motor turnover. At speed the battery gauge stays right on 
the 12v line, it used to ride around 13v. The battery was 3 years old and 
dead.  Earlier we replaced the RPM sensor - the root cause of getting stranded 
& towed. (Maybe there was more than the sensor).

Lately, the motor will sprightly turn over, but sometimes will not start - the 
motor will not fire at all. (Not effected by throttle pedal). If I come back 
an hour later, it will start. It runs great otherwise and is an absolute 
pleasure on the super slab.

I'm thinking something is amiss in the cold start sensor circuit (choke?), or 
fuel pump sensors. I've missed a few meetings and been late to work trying to 
get out the garage. The starting is unpredictable, I cringe when I turn the 
key.

Thanks in advance for your help.
Bill Barker
