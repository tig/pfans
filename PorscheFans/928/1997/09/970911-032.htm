Hello fellow 928 fans!

After an introduction to 300km/hr (>170 mph) in my friend's new 911 turbo in
northern Germany, I upgraded from my '84 S to a new '93 GTS (now at 13k
miles, no PO for me!). 

I've been watching the Pfan email traffic; I enjoy learning something new
every day.  I'll share some experience with my '93 GTS.  

At first the "toothed belt" warning came on after a brief excursion up to
120+ mph during a trip to San Diego.  Nothing after that for a while.
Later, the warning has came on at lower speeds.  After canceling the
warning, it never reappeared.  After reading about the risks of ignoring
this warning, I just had the cam belt retensioned.  My local mechanic billed
1.8 hrs. labor, $97.20.  I'd recommend Stuttgart SW to anyone in the Phoenix
area, say hello to Jack.

I just picked up the "Project 928" book from Vasek Polak Porsche-Audi-VW,
199 Pacific Coast Highway, Hermosa Beach, CA 90254 (310)376-0935.  It was
about $60 with tax.  Great book, interesting insight into the early
development.  Pick up one while they are available.

Drive 'em like they're intended, "ganz schnell"
Rich
