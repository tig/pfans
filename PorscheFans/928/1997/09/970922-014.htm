Patrick, My mechanic is Pete Zimmermann at Redline Service in Santa Monica
(310) 450-7414

He is  a past president of the PCA region here and has written the book
'The Used 911 Story'.

Pete is honest and meticulous. I will not trust my 928 to anyone else.

Also: there's a white '88 5-speed for sale at a lot down in Studio City if
you're interested in hedging your bets...
