A couple of questions to throw out there:

1. My car's leaking oil around the oil pan gasket.  I checked the bolts and=
 they were loose.  Does anyone know the proper torque for these?  There are=
 several I can't get at to tighten - any suggestions?  I really need to put=
 in a new gasket.  Has anyone done this?  How involved is it?  Looks like t=
he engine would have to be raised up or even removed. (?)

2. My front lower ball joints are shot ('83 "S") and I see there's an upgra=
de to steel ones instead of the aluminum.  This upgrade appears to be prett=
y expensive by the time you get the bracket and the eccentrics for both sid=
es.  How necessary is this?  Any advice would be appreciated.  I'd also app=
reciate any advice on what to watch for when changing them.  I know I'll ne=
ed an alignment.  Anyone BTDT?

Thanks for any help!
