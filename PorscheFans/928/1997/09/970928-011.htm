I'll just add my two cents to the last part of your questions. I have a 78 Euro
in excellent shape.It has less than 65k miles, and the motor has been well cared
for. The early Euro's are supposed to have a few more beans than the early US
cars, something like 260 HP?

I also had a 94 Mustang with the 3.8 litre V6. There is no doubt in my mind that
the Mustang would take the Porsche with absolute ease. Yeah, other guys will make
all kinds of excuses for the 928 - it handles better, has more power about the 80
MPH mark etc. But the fact is that the old Porsche just can't hold a candle to a
newer modest US car in terms of launch-factor.

Having said that, I would never even consider trading my old 928 for a Mustang. I
hate being just another pea in the pod. I'll just drive my 928 slowly and soak up
the looks. Just smile and politely decline offers to race. Most people don't have
a clue that the car is a bulldog in greyhounds clothing.
