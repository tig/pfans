"Well, the thermostat (in this or any other liquid-cooled car engine) has 
a
far more limited role than you may think. It only determines whether or 
not
the coolant will be sent through the radiator (versus just circulating
within the engine). The thermostat generally opens up after the initial
warm-up (which otherwise would take too long, exposing the engine to 
damage
and depriving the car's occupants of heat in cool weather) and then stays
open. From that point forward, the coolant flows through the radiator,
there to get rid of excess heat from the engine."

Hi Leonard

I don't think this is quite true is it? The thermostat is there to 
regulate the coolant temperature and will open or close in order to do 
so. At ambient temperatures (that most of the world consider to be 
normal) it will likely never completely close once the motor has reached 
operating temperatures but it will certainly open more or less in an 
attempt to maintain a stable temperature. Proportional control in fact. 
If the ambient is high and your sitting in traffic for example, the 
engine driven fan may not be able to cool the engine sufficiently to 
maintain that proportional control and even though the thermostat is wide 
open the coolant temperature can rise to the point that the electric fan 
will turn on and continue blowing until its controlling switch in the 
radiator turns it off again. This cycle will repeat of course at which 
point the fan switch is now controlling the operating temperature of the 
engine. Until you get out of traffic or whatever anyway.

A quick comment about this water wetter stuff also. I've never even seen 
it let alone tried it but with proportional control loops being what they 
are its not possible for such a product to actually lower the operating 
temperature below the thermostat temperature rating. If it does what it 
claims the thermostat will just compensate and maintain the same 
temperature. In the hot hot hot situation above it would allow the 
thermostat to maintain control for longer and when the temperature gets 
out of the loop it would delay the time before the electric fan came on 
and would also speed up its cycling time. Not a bad thing I guess. My 
opinion, and any and all are welcome to disagree of course, is why 
bother. Even if it does what it claims the only time you might see a 
difference is in an over temperature condition and a lower temperature 
fan switch might be a better choice. Of course, if its dirt cheap and 
causes no detrimental effects there's not much to loose I guess. I'm off 
my soap box now.
