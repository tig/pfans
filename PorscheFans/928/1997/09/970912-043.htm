Hello again,
Anybody out there with 18" rims on their 928? Am considering the MSW Type
55C's (made by OZ) 18" x 8.5" front and 18" x 10" rear. These wheels are
hubcentric and TUV approved, but am wondering if the quality is as good as
say the aftermarket 17" Technology, C2, or Cup wheels? Also considered the
Tech Art 18" wheels (18" x 8.5" and 18" x 9.5"), but the people at Tech Art
told me that the fenders have to be rolled to accept them with the tires that
are called for. (offsets must be different than the MSW Type 55C's, which I
was told were correct offsets )
Both wheels were quoted with the NO Continental Sportcontacts, sizes 225-40
Fr. and  265-35 Rr. (doing the math also confirms this will give me very
close (within 2%) to the original ride height.) I've seen pictures of 928's
(928 International ad) with what must be 18" x 10" Fr. and 18" x 14" Rr.
How'd they do that!? Must have widebody kit or body flairs. Fat Albert has
(did anyone here buy that car, or hear who did) (must ask Lucky at the
"frenzy") a widebody kit with 10" and 12" x 17"s (275-? and 335-?) Seriously
tired! I digress; anyway, one question I have is, if my current wheels are 7"
and 8" x 16"s, (the flat wheels) will it look and be right to have wheels
1.5" wider in the front with the same width tires as now, and 2" wider wheels
in the rear with only a 3/4" wider tire than now? 
I know 18" rims are going to ride harsher and maybe noisier, but, ooh that
handling!
Speaking of handling, I also wonder about whether I'd be better off just
putting on the Kim Crumb/Automotion Weltmeister sport spring package, (do I
want my car an inch lower?) sway bar, and new shocks (maybe Koni reds) with
my original 16" wheels? Handling wise -- I guess I'd be better off with this
option,(or would I?) but, as far as harshness, which option would be worse?
Also, would I be insane, and just completely spoil the civility of my 928, if
I did both? (I know, you all are gonna say just do the suspension upgrade --
but then I wouldn't have groovy new wheels!)
As usual; advice, input, and criticism is appreciated. (Appreciation varies
accordingly!)  :) 
Warm Regards,
