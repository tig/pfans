Subject: Re: upgrade to steel ball joints

Jim,

All you really need is 2 new ball joints at $95 each and 2 used eccentrics
at $25 each.  The only difference in the bracket is that the new one has
shorter bolts.  I don't think you care if you bolts extend an extra 10mm do
you?  I know they say you need to replace both eccentrics but we have found
that one of them works just fine.

Thanks
