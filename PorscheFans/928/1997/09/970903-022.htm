I've heard a lot of buzz about parts and especially people in Massachusetts
who want parts. Well the person who put my yellow car together just got
these cars in and wants everyone on the 928 list to know. The cars are in
Rockland, MA, but of course parts can be shipped.

90' 928S4 19k miles
interior sold (to Lucky Eckman, Devek)
calipers/rotors, suspension available
motor available
5-speed transmission available
rear bumper cover,w/ lights
plus more

87 S4, auto
all sorts of things available, call with your needs


Email p928s4@erols.com or call (617) 489-6645 and ask for me, Paul
Hatziiliades, if you need any parts.

Also, there are two 928 S' that are also being parted out.

This guy, Stash Papantoniadis, has been working with 928s for 12 years, and
supplies known companies like Devek and 928 International with parts.

You have 5 days to examine the part and notify if you want to return it
(less shipping).
Orders over $350 must be pre-paid, COD can be done for anything under.
