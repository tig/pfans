Stephane, 
I had this problem about 2 weeks ago.  Bought the little plastic
cup which had 2 washer-fluid hose connectors, and that little
hole in the middle, which is supposed to allow the wire bundle 
go from the car to the sensor and the hood light.  Funny, on my car,
the previous owner left evidence of his attempt to correct this
problem, but he gave up.  He simply drilled out the connector (or what
was left of the broken one) and slipped a straight piece of plastic
tubing through the hole to make the connection on either side of the
plastic cap.  Now of course being the proud new owner, this just
wouldn't do - not to mention I had just bought a new one and was
determined to make  it work.  Tracing either end of the wire, one end
leads to the the jet nozzle where it seemed to be cast into the fitting
(way too big to fit through the little hole) The other lead to a 3-wire
connector.

1) Remove the rubber weather-stripping that runs across the engine
   compartment from side to side - this will allow you to remove the
   plastic tray that protects the blower, wiper motor, and your 3-wire
   fitting...
2) I hope you have more success with taking the fitting appart than I
   did, but you may need a razor, and carefully cut a single slice into
   the plastic that holds the tab in-place on either side of the 
   connector.  Don't remove any of the plastic, just sever it.  I    
   resorted to doing this after about 15 minutes of trying to pull the 2 
   appart. It loosened the fitting enough.
3) Draw a diagram and note the wire-color and position on the
male-end    of the connector.  Using needle-nose pliers, carefully push
the tips
   through the connector and now you are able to push the wire through
   the cap.  Dremmel-tool the contacts clean if neccessary, and re-
   insert the pins (carefully noting your diagram/notes)

I need to find a bunch of these connectors for this very reason - does
anyone sell them?

John
