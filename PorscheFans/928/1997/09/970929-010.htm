Subject:	Pan Gasket replacement help =


While changing the oil in my '89GT I noticed oil on the pan and that =

the pan gasket was cracked and bulging out on one side.  I was told =

that the steering rack has to come down and a lot of stuff must be =

removed to get the pan off and replace the gasket.  Is there a way to =

just raise the engine up a few inches and do the work this way?  If =

any one has done this -  a brief step by step would be very much =

appreciated.  =

wanted to see if you were paying attention.



Roy,

Sorry, I don't have an answer for you, but I need to do the same thing on m=
y car.  I was at the Frenzy this weekend and they touched on this briefly. =
 Apparently this can be done by raising the engine up a little (maybe 2" or=
 so) OR removing the steering rack (in which case you need an alignment).  =
It wasn't clear to me exactly how to do this.  Perhaps someone can clarify =
this with a procedure (I think a lot of 928 owners need to do this, from wh=
at I've heard).  How about it y'all, anyone BTDT?

Roy, if you figure out how to do it, please let us all know how you did it.=
  I'll do the same, but I won't be getting to mine anytime soon. To many ot=
her things to do. I'll probably get to it over the winter, seems like a goo=
d winter project.

Oh yeah, I think Kim Crumb also advised that if you do this, you should ins=
tall the "windage tray" or baffle(?) from the GTS in the oil pan to help ke=
ep the oil from sloshing around.  He said it bolts right in.  Especially if=
 you're autocrossing or racing.  Maybe someone can clarify this.
