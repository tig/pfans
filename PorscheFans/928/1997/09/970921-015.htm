I have been to Kurt site as well, and it does look intimidating.  I had
the fortune of running into Kurt at a PCA autocross, and disgussed at
length his procedures.  

A couple weeks later I drove to his place and we spent very enjoyable
Saturday checking the alignment of my car, and two other 928s.  Camber
could be checked in less than half an hour, and as the results proved,
Kurt's method is extremely accurate.  I spent hours with an alignment
shop and spent well over $100 only to achieve a half-ass alignment.

I don't mind spending an evening with my 928, working on doing the job
correctly and accurately.  Given the time, you can do it yourself and do
a better job that any shop will.
