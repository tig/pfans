Well, I usually succumb to temptation when I'm in my car, but I was on a
business trip recently and rented a red Mustang coup=E9. While rolling along
the local Interstate, I noticed a red 300 ZX come up fast from behind and
match speed with me on the right.

Habit told me to put it in third and floor it, but then I realized that I
was in this silly Mustang (Hertz is NOT putting V8s in their cars these
days) in which this maneuver would produce an unpleasant struggling noise
and not much else, so I gave him a good snob look (Hi, Greg!). He tore off,
but came back later, pulled the same maneuver, and got the same look.

This was an interesting view into another culture (no Z-car has ever pulled
alongside my 928; the last red victim was a Viper roadster).
