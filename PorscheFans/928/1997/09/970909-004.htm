    Awright......as usual......I'll be a day or so late in my
pontification on the subject -

Lemme get this straight:  ONE individual wrote an opinion in a car
magazine criticizing the construction of the 928.  The original thread
started about a week ago, and we are still debating it's validity and
bashing the offending magazine?  I don't fault Automobile, because good
journalism SHOULD invite debate.  For all we know, most of the magazine
staff may have disagreed with the article's conclusions for the same
reasons discussed in here.  Automobile's intent is not to merely report
car models and specifications, but to separate itself from most of the
other mags by including lifestyle and opinion as part of it's content.
David E. Davis has always been a provacateur in publishing.  There is
always an ariticle or two about cheese and wine trips through the Alps,
or a visit to Fangio's birthplace to eat wild boar and drink the local
brew.  Jean Lindamood's career is based on obscure observations.
Geez.....Brock Yates.....I'd say he may have an opinion or two......

No - I'm in no way affiliated with Automobile, or even publishing.  The
magazine delivers what it promises (in my opinion) - a blend of
technical information, history, opinion, humor, and automobilia.

WHEW!   As far as body integrity is concerned..........the 928 is
unitized construction.  Therefore, the basis for the total is dependent
on each component (i.e. shell, suspension, doors, hood, etal).  It is
not accurate to suggest the doors and hood and other aluminum components
do not contribute to 'stiffness.'  It is true that the body panels are
not designed as 'stress' components as the frame rails and pillars, but
they are critical to the mechanical design integrity of the assembled
car.  The reason the roof and pillars and sills are steel is precisely
to provide enough basic rigidity so that the lighter aluminum panels can
be utilized.  However, these aluminum panels are still required to
achieve overal objective.  Airframes are aluminum (as already pointed
out in a previous email) for excellent ratio of stiffness to weight -
but have you ever counted how many rivets are used at the seams?   The
skin of aircraft is critical to it's design strength (stiffness).  The
multiple rivets distribute the stress at the fasteners enought that the
aluminum will not rip or tear under stress - essentially the same
principle as used in our cars.  As far as the comment about the 928
sagging if the roof is cut off - that should not be a surprise at all
because the roof is absolutely critical to maintaing overall shape of
the cabin and body.

There.....I feel so much better!   Okay - the target is slapped to my
forehead - comments, suggestions, criticisms, Kevorkian's phone number
are all welcome!
