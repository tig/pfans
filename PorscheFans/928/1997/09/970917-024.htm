I recently purchased a 84 auto and am currently working through some misc.
problems. Temp gauge consistently runs around the top white mark. The
auxiliary cooling fan does not work. Here's my current plan of action: 1)
Get the electric fan working... Is there a common failure mode for the fan?
Switch/relay/poor ground/etc? The fuse is not blown. 2) Purchased a lo temp
thermostat and fan switch, radiator hoses, WaterWetter. Plan to install this
weekend. Any tricks or suggestions? 3) Would like to flush the radiator
while I'm in there.  
Any recommended products that won't damage the cooling system but will clean
out the gunk? 4) I've purchased some 5year Prestone phosphate/silicate free
antifreeze. Is this OK to use?
BTW the car has 10,000 miles (thats right- 10K documented) on it, is
identical to Phil Tong's with the exception of the polished wheels. I have
had the timing belt changed and transmission serviced. Records indicate the
car has been pretty well treated as far as coolant and oil changes at
regular intervals. Any recommendations on problems to look for on a car like
this which hasn't been driven much? Also, get a strong gasoline odor when
the tank is near full which goes away when the level drops. Fuel gauge
doesn't work... don't know if the two are related.    
thanks in advance...
