I don't believe the 928 is prone to losing its rigidity with age. Nor 
any modern car for that matter. Not that I consider most Detroit iron 
to be modern. :-)

An Infiniti convertable? Must have been an M-30. And if you check, it was 
only on the market a year or two, when Nissan was launching the Infiniti 
mark. Apparently the M-30 was something Nissan had on the shelf that had 
not been seen in the US and could muster our emissions and crash tests.

As for the G-20, I have a 1993.5 model. An excellent car to share a garage 
with a 928S. Porsche could learn from Infiniti, but I don't have a recent 
Porsche to know what they've learned since 1983. What I'd like Porsche to 
learn is that their cars are kept forever and washed, loved, and repaired. 
Not thrown away at 100k miles. Accessability (that's certianly spelled 
wrong) and servicablity are things Porsche needs to keep in mind.

My 928's electrical system is a nightmare. When I found one of my HVAC 
gremlins was due to a section of its control box was grounded thru the 
cigarette lighter and the other half was grounded elsewhere, I wasn't 
pleased. The cigarette lighter ground, wasn't. And up to that point I 
didn't care if the cigarette lighter worked or not.

So far I haven't had to track down that kind of problem in the Infiniti. 
But Porsche could learn another thing from Infiniti, each and every car 
is shipped with the complete service manual in the trunk. And there is 
a shelf on the left in the trunk for storing the manuals. Right next to 
a place for a spare quart of oil.

Infiniti could learn from Porsche. My wheels are not totally alignable. 
Forgot if it was caster or camber which isn't adjustable on the front. 
Probably both. There is little adjustment if one wheel is in front of 
the other. And little or no adjustment for vertical tilt. OTOH earlier 
this year my favorite NTW shop managed a ROTTEN alignment. Car drove OK 
but made a mess of my rear tires in 2500 miles.
