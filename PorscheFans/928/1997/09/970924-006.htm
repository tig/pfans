Stephane,
>1. We discussed changing the hose to the windshield nozzle a while back
<snip>
>My question is how do you get the electrical wires through
>that little hole if you have a nozzke at one end of the wires and a big
>connector at the other end?

Take a small jewelers screwdriver and depress the tab on the metal connector
inside the plastic connector, while firmly pulling the wire w/metal connector
out of the plastic connector from the wire side. Do the same for the other wire.
Then run the loose wires through the holes on the hood service cover and
reinsert into plastic connector

>2. To remove the windshield washer reservoir, do you just remove that 1
>bolt on the bracket
>or is there some other bolt that is not visible to the naked eye?
Yes , just one bolt. However some years have a hose going into the top of the
reservoir which you need to remove in order pull the reservoir all the way out.


>3. The y piece leading to the charcoal canister is split (part # 928 201
>219 02).  Will this
>affect performance of my car (vacuum leak?)
Not necessarily affect performance, can cause gas smell inside car, or worse,
FIRE.



>4. There is a small black knobby sensor inside my air intake box, what
>is it for?
???

>5. On the air box cover, passenger side, there is a large connector
>going downward
>to a large rubber tube (to where??) but there is also a small connection
>for a smaller
>tube (parallel to the ground). Where does it goes?  I don't even have a
>hose in that area...
Sounds like someone had "desmogged" your 928 , this should be going to a vacuum
controlled check valve that sends air from your air pump to your "cat" or
bypasses to your airbox .
