James & others in the Northeast,

Let me say that Sunday was a blast.  Mark and I were absolutely amazed
at the standings after our first runs - few had beaten either of us (and
I was pretty pleased with being only 1.5 s behind Mark).  Of course,
then on the 2nd run, Mark completely "killed", no obliterated, everyone
but the heavily modified cars.  Unfortunately we were both on the track
at the same time so that we couldn't critique one another.  Thanks again
for the invite Mark - of course, we had to do well - Mark and I both
noticed the date on our entry forms.

This Sunday, the CVR chapter has its final auto-X.  Most certainly will
be a 911/914 course but it'd be nice to see a few '28's there.  We'll be
missing Mark and David Lloyd so come on out.  It's in Branford CT
starting around 9:30 am.  Of course, I'm really looking forward to next
Saturday for the final CVR driver's ed at Lime Rock (we'll see how many
cars will refuse to wave-by a 928 after being caught).

Finally a thanks to Ed Ruiz for organizing "Frenzy"  and a hello to all
the faces I matched with names:  Stephane, Leonard, David, Gregg, Mark
and Susan, Kim
immediately come to mind.

Best,
Kurt
'87 S4 5sp

(BTW, I figured Mark ought to console the 993 owners by telling them
that maybe they'd have beaten him if they had AUTOMATIC transmissions
too.)
