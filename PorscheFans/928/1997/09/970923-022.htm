Hey folks:

I have a '83 928S (stock) and a '86 928S (with Authority chip, Borla
exhaust, Devek sway bar, Eibach springs, K&N filter etc.) both black/black
5-speeds. Despite numerous alignments, both cars tend to eat up front tires
like crazy and wear on the inside. My local shop owner has an mid 80's
automatic 928 but he drives it like the little old lady from St.
Petersburg, not the little old lady from Pasadena. Although I have the
factory manual set and do some repairs myself when I have time and the
ability, I have had to rely on the local mechanic as far as
suspension/alignment.


The mechanics informed me that they have added some toe in to the alignment
but it doesn't seem to help much. Also, when the Devek sway bar and Eibach
springs were added to the '86 928S, a rack spacer had to be added to avoid
tire rubbing when turned from lock to lock......is this necessary? The
spring package lowered the car about an inch or so and has also apparently
affected the rake angle (rack angle?). Since I am fed up with my local
mechanics, I am planning to go to Jacksonville to Brumos Porsche. Any tips
you guys can give me before I go are greatly appreciated.
Thanks............Kevin

ps: has anyone had problems with the speedo and odometer?........both of
mine have been repaired twice.
