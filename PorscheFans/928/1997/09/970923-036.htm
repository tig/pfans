FWIW,  I tend to look at insurance (especially liability coverage) as a way
to protect one's other assets from an overly sympathetic jury.  "Of course
that man was at fault for running the light,  but he was hurt and certainly
deserves something!"  My sympathy isn't quite the same,  but I don't get to
be my own jury.

Enough said.


In the meanwhile,  20th Century wrote a full package for me today, $500
deductible on both the comp and the collision, 100/300 and 100 on injury and
property damage.  Cost is a bit less than $600 twice a year.  This is a
secondary car, so I saved a bit.  BTW, this is for an OC residence in the
L.A. market.  I was anticipating a bit more, so I'm happy with the deal.


Like many others,  I've managed to make it all these years without a claim.
Yet I still am subjected to some statistical analysis that concludes that
I'm either accident prone because of the type or brand of car I (and all
those other statistics) drive,  or that I'm way overdue for a collision or
something.  Whichever is the most expensive will be the choice made for me...


Done whining!  Everybody have a great day!  My secretary had her first ride
in  a 928 today.  Told here she needs to hang with a better crowd.


Cheers!
