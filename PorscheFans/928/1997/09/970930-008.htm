> I had the same problem on my 83 928s.  To solve it I had to
> remove the seat.  This is not a simple operation when you can't
> slide the seat.  The 83 928 has a manual mechanism to default the motor.
> This mechanism is a black rod about 1/4 inch in diameter that when
> moved sideways disengages a gear from the motor.  In my case this
> mechanism was also stuck.

> The seat is held in place by four allen screws (metric ).  You may be able

> the front allen screws.  Remove these.  Next, remove black plastic covers in
> the back and right of the seat.  The covers are held in place by Phillips
> screws that,
> when the seat in is stuck all the way back, are hard to remove.  A short
> phillips
> screw driver helps.  Also, lift the rear of the seat as much as you can with
> the up-down power button.  The right-rear allen screw will be easy to remove
> once the seat is all the way up.  The left-rear allen screw is hard to
> reach (patience).
> 
> After the four screws are out disconnect electrical power and lift the
> seat out.  Next, remove the motor of the front-rear mechanism by
> removing a black bracket held by three black screws (10 or 11 mm screws).
> You may test your motor now by connecting it to the wire that was left
> in the car (the one that sends power to the seat motors).
> 
> It will be easy now to reinstall the seat if you can slide the seat back
> and forth.
> In my case I am careful not to move the seat all the way back so it doesn't
> get stuck
> again.  The manual default works well now and I use it most of the time.
> If you find a way such that the seat does not get stuck again let me know.
