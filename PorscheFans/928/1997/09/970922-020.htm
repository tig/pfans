Hey David,

I've had a couple of these bad boys out and did a speedo upgrade on my
own.  Here's what I've found.

That little gear you're talking about is a plastic unit that "dissolves"
over time.  This causes the weird effect of the speedo working but the
odo not rolling the miles.  This is the primary cause of most mileage
logging inaccuracies for our cars.  Any good VDO certified shop (see
Excellence) has the little gear to fix this problem.  I would like to
ask the list if they know of a source for this little gear as the shops
I've called are reluctant to sell it to me; can't figure out why.  (FYI,
in Texas if a car is 10 years old or over, it doesn't matter what the
mileage is as the title reads "EXEMPT" in big bold letters indicating
the state assumes you're vehicle is played out).  

I was lucky enough to have a couple of spare clusters with good gears
laying around here.  Removal/Replacement is not that hard.  The unit
comes apart into two halves, the speedo part with the electronics and
the little electric motor that drives and the ODO part that has the
gears and number wheels.  Just be careful not to break anything while
you're disassembling.  BTW, the speedo needle just pulls off the unit.
(And don't be tempted to roll back your mileage!! It's a criminal
offence).

Good Luck,
