We're having our timing belt changed. Should we also change the tooth 
profile?

According to the official Porsche shop manual, the tooth profile was 
changed as of 1983 models. The manual for 83 shows the outline of the 
old and new profiles on the same page, one above the other, as if for 
comparison. The new profile has deeper teeth and rounded tips on each 
tooth but the same number of teeth per inch. The manual, and a post 
here, says you can change earlier models to the new profile, but you 
have to change all the sprockets also.

The manual photo refers to five sprockets: Crank, left cam, right cam,
 water pump, oil pump. 

The manual calls the new type a High Torque belt. Is it that by 1983, 
the 928's were gaining a bad rep for self-damage, so they changed 
profiles to make belts less likely to slip? Why would the '83 manual 
go out of its way to compare profiles and mention that you can change 
older models? Why would they think anyone would want to change? Did 
Porsche consider this an upgrade or fix, a sort of recall at the 
customer's expense? Or did they change because the 83's and later had 
more valves thus needed more power to work them all? Or am I missing 
something here?

This car has gone 70k with the old profile, and to best of knowledge 
never a slipped tooth. It was and will be conservatively driven.
