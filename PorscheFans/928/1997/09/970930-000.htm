Regards to all who just had a ball at the East Coast Frenzy, I was able
to enjoy recent event at DEVEK and can relate, kind of like finding
people who speak your alien language.
Am having some minor elec blips, stereo wants more power than it is
getting and shuts down, and blowing fuses for clock/interior lites, no
joy troubleshooting and isolating, any ideas?
With regards to the recent 'beat the mustang' stuff, I drive the car, as
I suspect many of us do, because I love the torque available when I need
to go for that opening in freeway traffic and know that I am able to do
so safely, and also, again, as I suspect we do, am unable to walk away
from this car when I park in the 7 story structure at SFO without
looking back at it,  several times, knowing it is the only beautiful one
among many boxes.
I'm off to Australia today, will report on 928 sightings.
