 Hallo all sharkfans!!!

I'm so happy for my 928S4 and would like to tell why. I'm just returned =
from one week long vacation in Venecia, Italy. My wife and I drove from =
copenhagen thru Germany and Austria to North Italy in just 11 houers =
(app. 910miles). The weather and road conditions were superb (sunshine =
and nearly no cars, eccept near big cities, the "Autostrasse" has only =
two traces in eath direction). Half the way, at a speed at 145mph, i =
reconized at 928GTS driving app 135mph in from off me. When I got less =
than 200feet behind, it accelerated op to 160mph. I keept behind and we =
were driving at tha=B4t speed for nearly 90minutes. Then the GTS turned =
off to a petrolstation and I went after to refuel. I was very surprised =
when saw that it was at lady between 50 and 60 !!! that had droven the =
GTS. Germany are told to be Porschecontry, but I only saw 7 (3 928) in =
1400miles. The faster you drive the 928, the better the "grip" felt. At =
speed behind 160 the engine rews 5700+, but are still quiet and not =
running hot. When you pass another car (driving 75mph) at that speed, it =
look like seeing in the mirrows that it jump 2ft sideways. In North =
Italy people did not mentioned the shark. Why???. Cause it's here the =
Ferraries are made. There were a lot of F355 and F550 Maranello drivind =
around. The "Autostrada" are in very good shape (you must pay for =
driving). Topspeed are 80mph, but you can easily drive 100mph (eccept at =
the mountains). Home on only 10.15h and NOT feeling tired we count the =
gasbuilds: $500.- (gasoline cost around 4.2$/gallon in Germany and =
4.8$/gallon in Italy.

On september the 17. my brother (owns a 928GTS chiptuned and measured to =
190+mph) and I are going to visit the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen. =
After that we drive to frankfurt to visit the International Autoshow =
(were the new 911 are shown). I got back with news from factoryvisit.

90 928S4 black and beatyful=20
