Hi Porschefans,

  On Sept. 7, 1997 somebody said Porsche racing sucks (maybe he was
talking about racing jets or something).  I am not trying to be a
smartass or anything, but the facts prove that Porsche racing was so
dominant from 1970-1973 that their car was outlawed in 1974.  Here is a
little history:

Porsche 917 debuted in 1969 with a 580 horsepower flat 12 engine,
weighed 1760 lbs, and topped out at 236 mph.  Won every race in 1970
except three.  In 1971 won every race that it was entered into.  It was
outlawed in certain races so it ran mostly Can-Am races. In 1973 the
engine was increased to 5.4 liters and was turbocharged(1100 horsepower
and at full boost it sprung 1560 horspower.  It was banned from all
races in 1974.  If you want to see some more excellent  Porsche racing
history check it out at www.olemiss.edu/~waltail/racing.htm
