     Greg,
     
     I have the MSW Type 55C 18's mounted with CZ91 Sport Contacts on my 91 
     GT. The only difference is that my fronts are 235-40's. The rears fit 
     perfect, but I did have minor clearance problems on the front. The 
     rear of the tire rubbed on the plastic lower body cladding that wraps 
     into the wheel well at the bottom of the fender. I trimmed the plastic 
     corner back to the metal fender lip on the inside of the fender. This 
     may be hard to visualize but it can't be seen from the side of the 
     car. This may not have been a problem with 225's.
     
     The ride is not harsh but is firmer, especially over sharp bumps or 
     concrete joints. You definitely have to watch out for potholes! I had 
     these wheels and tires on my '89 944S2 with M030 suspension and Konis 
     and that was uncomfortable. On the 928, it is not much different than 
     the stock setup maybe because of the RDK system which required 44psi 
     in the rear tires.
     
     The 18's look GREAT and give the car a true Exotic appearance which it 
     deserves. I'm not overly impressed with the Continental CZ91's. I 
     would follow Leonard's advice and go with Michelin Pilots. When I 
     bought mine, the Continentals were much lower in price but I have 
     heard great things about the Michelins and wished I would have spent 
     the exta $'s.
     
     I say go for the 18's, but be prepared for a few small concessions. My 
     wife's BMW 318ti has 17's which give it a muscular, unique look. The 
     928 can handle more.
