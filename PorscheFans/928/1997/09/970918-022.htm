Dear Brain etal:

Like you I don't mind having my phone # and address available to Frenzy
attendees. However, you and I may be the exception and not the rule. Since I
don't know, I will err on the side of privacy. 

There will be a bulletin board (BB) on site and you can augment the
information posted as you like. On the "BB" I will allow any 928 related
postings such as parts or cars for sale. The "BB" will not be huge, so keep
postings to a 3"X 5" card or an 8.5"X 11" page with a photo.

If there are any other issues that need to be covered before the event,
please feel free to contact me. I will be at Summit Point on 9/22, but will
be back on the "net" the following day.

Happy motoring and see you real soon. Ed
