Well - although my car (with its current paint job) really isnt the cause
for a lot of head-turning (except at certain angles and when its passing
people that dont like to be passed) I still have a backup routine I like
to do if someone gives me attitude - 

You just shut em up and say "Whats the difference between a Porsche and a
porcupine?"

"On a porcupine the pricks' on the outside."

Usually -after that they realize that you're not a bad person just
because you have a car that kicks ass all over theirs. Self deprecation
really works to bring people who are jealous of you closer to
understanding that you're just another guy. (with a bullet instead of a
yugo..)
