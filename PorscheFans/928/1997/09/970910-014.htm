John-
$14,995 is way too high for an 84 928, no matter what the condition.  I've
found 87's for people in that price range.  As you may or may not know I do
auto locating and brokering - specializing in Porsche - and I would be more
than happy to help you find a car.  Below is some information on my services.
Regards,
Brian

Thank you for your interest in my locating and brokering service.  Although I
specialize in Porsche and Mercedes-Benz I am able to locate almost any
automobile that you would have an interest in purchasing.  Below is an
explanation of what I do as well as the rates for my services.  

First Steps:
During our initial conversation I will discuss with you exactly what you are
looking for in an automobile.  How you plan to use the car, your preferred
interior and exterior colors, mileage, transmission type, service history,
and preferred condition of the body and mechanicals are all very important to
me as I am locating your next automobile.  The maximum price you are willing
to pay for the perfect example of what you are looking for will also be
discussed.

Locating Process:
After our initial conversation I will begin searching for your car based on
the criteria you have given me by utilizing various automobile publications
and the Internet, as well as several automobile dealers and wholesalers that
I have active business relationships with.  Usually it will take me from
three to seven days to find between five and fifteen cars that fall within
your specifications.  Before I am in touch with you again I will call the
owners of each of these automobiles and obtain all of the important
information on each of them.  Next comes your decision - which of the cars
that I have found interests you the most.

Final Steps:
After you decide which cars you have the most interest in you then must also
decide how involved you would like me to be in the purchasing process.
 Although I always try to locate automobiles that are within driving distance
of the client's home, sometimes the exclusivity of certain brands and models
limits the choices, making  travel necessary.  In this case I can arrange to
have pictures or a video of the car sent to you, as well as have a
pre-purchase inspection performed on the automobile by an honest and
reputable third-party mechanic.  If time or finances limits you from
personally flying or driving to take possession of the car then door to door
delivery can also be arranged.

Rates:
Before the first steps of the locating process are begun I require that a
fifty dollar ($50) non-refundable deposit be sent to cover my time and
telephone charges in the event that you decide not to purchase an automobile
through me.  It's unfortunate that I have to require this, but more than once
I have spent quite a bit of time, trouble, and money trying to locate a car
for a less than serious buyer - leaving me with nothing but an elevated phone
bill!  However, when deals go through smoothly the $50 deposit is applied to
the purchaser's final locating cost.  The final charge will depend on my
level of involvement in the purchase and delivery of your car, but the
average range is between $350 and $650.

Advantages of Buxton Motorsports:
There are many benefits to dealing with a small, individually owned locating
service such as mine.  One is that you will always deal with the owner, and I
will always be working to find you the best automobile for your money.  Also,
as compared with other locating companies the fees that I charge are very
reasonable due in part to my low overhead costs.  This benefits the purchaser
by not having the price of the automobile raised by $1 - $2,000, enabling all
of your money to work towards your purchase.  As the past and present owner
of various sports cars I understand the difference that $1,000 can make in
the mileage and cosmetic / mechanical conditions of many cars. Another
advantage is that I am honest and offer nationwide locating and a great deal
of very personal service to the purchaser.  And finally, as mentioned before,
every deal is important to me, so weeks of waiting will not be a part of the
locating process.  The average time it takes for me to locate most sports and
luxury cars is three to five days.  Again, thank you for your interest and
please feel free to contact me at the above phone numbers to discuss any of
this information further.
