It would have been nice if they'd all posted to the mailing list instead of
directly to you, so that we all could have shared their wisdom!

The 928 is a very special vehicle. Designed from scratch. Those of us who
recognise its quality are (perhaps) special people.

I hope you find a 928 to your liking. As it will be your first 928
purchase, I would suggest you enlist the assistance of our resident vehicle
broker. :^)

Cheers,
