Greetings all. Man, I've miss being here, but between my back operation and
my modem getting zapped by lightening, I've been away since the middle of
July. 
Not to start on a bad note, but after not starting my car for about a month,
when I started it, it sounded and idled rough for 5 to 10 seconds. (like a
knocking noise) 
Oil pressure was pegged as usual on startup. The car is an 87' 5spd. with
almost 70k miles. Always Mobil 1 every 3000 to 3500 miles. It's done a
similar thing twice before. (2 and 4 years ago) Otherwise car runs strong and
has been bulletproof.  Have any of you had this happen to you? Should I be
overly concerned? What could it be? (rod?-heaven forbid!)






                                                                             
I've been trying to catch up and assimilate all the posts I've missed, so
bear with me. 
Where is the rubber flap located that allows access to clean the debris out
of the ductwork?
Also, maybe one better question would be, "Who's car doesn't have the "magic
blower" anomaly?" Or is it even a problem? 
Did the K&N people ever get back with an answer about the filtering
capabilities of their product compared to paper filters?
Check out Autoweek (Sept.8) article on the upcoming 911. Nice car! 
Here's an excerpt from the article. "Overall, when the 1999 model arives, the
handling may seem more familiar to those who have owned 968s or even 928s
than earlier 911s --- predictable, unflappable and extremely secure...."
 Boy, don't we already know it! 
Input on above questions would be much appreciated.
