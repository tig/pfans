I just bought a '82 euro (with some glitches, but it was cheap), and I have
a few (heh) qusetions for you guys.

I'm wondering if any of these problems ring a bell before I start trying to
diagnose them from scratch with zero 928 knowledge.

- the gauges in the left half of the pod are dead.  Only the TAIL LAMP and
	STOP LAMP lights light (of those on the left side) when you turn on
	the ignition.  No speedo or odo, no temp gauge, no fuel gauge and no
	other warning lights.  The Central Warning Light, and everything to
	its right works, except the oil pressure gauge, which is stuck off
	the scale past "5".  I'm hoping this is a well known failure mode
	with a simple solution.  OK, so I'm slightly optimistic. :-)  If it's
	not easy to fix, what are my chances of finding a recycled pod
	that'll work?

- the power steering boost is inconsistent.  As you turn the steering wheel,
	it feels like the boost is coming and going suddenly (kind of like
	you're turning it through big lumps).  The PO said he replaced the
	rack, and the mechanic told him the steering column had to be
	replaced.  On the road, this isn't too bothersome until the boost
	suddenly reappears as I'm making a slow turn and I suddenly find I've
	over-shot my intended steering movement and turned the wheel too far.

- when started cold, the engine acts as though the EFI doesn't know the
	engine is cold.  It tends to stall at first, before finally settling
	into a (seemingly correct) slightly high cold idle.  Using the loud
	pedal is pointless, however, until it's warmed up as it stumbles,
	coughs and basically acts like the EFI doesn't know it's cold - like
	a carb with a choke that isn't working.

Do any of these ring any bells with you long-timers?

Can any of you euro-spec owners give me an idea how many things on our cars
are different from the US-spec cars?  If I get the factory repair manuals,
will they be US-spec specific, or will they also apply to my car?  

Is it worth my while to get the L-Jetronic manual?  Is the Chilton's book
any good?  I can't believe Chilton's lumped the 928 and 924 into the same
book.

If the synchros on 1st, 2nd and 3rd gears are shot am I better off getting
it repaired/rebuilt or just dropping in a rebuilt transaxle (928 Int'l has
them for $1800)?  Is there anything that can be done to increase the
longevity of the synchros?  I'm not an abusive shifter, but they're
apparently a weak point.

It has the black/white (sort of) checkered interior fabric, which is old and
splitting on the seat cushions.  Is there a vendor who does replacement
unholstery panels in the original materials?  That fabric pattern is really
bizarre, and I think I want to keep it.

I'll be driving it to the Shark Fest (I live nearby, near Baltimore), but you
guys have to priomise not to laugh at it.  Some PO repainted it black over
the original black paint at some point, and it's peeling off now (yuck).
I'll repaint it one day and make it pretty again - I promise!

Oh yeah, and the ignition switch doesn't spring back from the start
position.  Will just replacing the electrical part of the ignition switch
fix this (and possibly the pod problem), or is that spring part of the lock
cylinder?

And yes, I got it cheap.  :-)

PS - I always knew I'd love this car, and I do.  It's a keeper for sure.
