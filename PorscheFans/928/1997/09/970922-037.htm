Something caught my eye in aug 97 Excellence mag. on p41 there is an advert
that offers throttle body mods and i was wondering if anybody is currently
using or has tested such a product. I called the company and he said the mod
makes 8-10 % more hp in a stock engine.  I didnt have time to ask for
details, but i did email devek today to see if they offer a similar mod or
have tested such.  A guy i work with that has raced 944 and done plenty of
perf work on 928 and 911 says it is a really good mod and the price at $350
is fair.  He did however state that it is a fairly complex machining process
because a decent venturi must remain or vaccuum operated acc. could suffer. 
I really dont want to be the first person on the list to try this Please let
me know if any of you have experience with this
Thanks
