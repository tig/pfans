Brian,
I had the same problem with my S4 when I bought it. I tried all the tricks,
drying it out with hair dryer, 2 sets of new lamps, etc. . Nothing seemed to
work for over a week or so, or until the next time I washed my car or got caught
in a rainstorm ;-(.
The end result was to find a nice used (new ones are outrageous) replacement
lamp at a good deal and the problem disappeared for good. If you get a used one,
look for signs of water spots etc. inside before purchase.
I wish I had a better answer, maybe someone else has had better long term
results.
