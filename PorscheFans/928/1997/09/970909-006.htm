Hi 928 Fans:

This is my first post to the 928 list, so I'll keep it brief:
Been looking for an mid-eighties 928 on & off for a while. Got a call
earlier today from a non-P Dealer in mass who said he just took one in
on trade with the following short list of features.  I'd like any
comments anyone may have about the year, what I should look for, etc..
As I do all my own P car work (both 911's and the 944 T), I am familiar
with P' car mechanics, but as this might be the first 928, unsure of
what I specifically might look for or what I should expect to pay
(regardless of what they are asking).

Anyway, here's the stuff on this one: 84 928 S, blk on blk, 105K miles,
5 sp, leather, cruise, AM/FM/Cass, moon roof, new clutch (by Porsche
Dealership), major Service (by Porsche Dealership). Always garaged,
never re-sprayed and the car is in "mint" (their words, not mine - (my
opinion - only coins are minted, cars aren't.))  They are asking $14,
995.  Have surfed the web and found some good 928 sites, but 84 info is
scarce except for the http://www.928s4vr.com site (great 928 site...)

Thanks in advance for any thoughts, advice, comments, etc. :-)

John Dunkle
87 911 Carrera
70 911 w/3.2 and RS look (track car)
86 944 Turbo
and maybe a 928? in the future
