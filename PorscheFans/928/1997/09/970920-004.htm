Greg,
How ironic, I was just thinking about the K&N thing yesterday and wondering if I
will ever get a response, so far nothing. This silence tells me all that I need
to know.

The "flap" is not for cleaning leaves and debris from the cowl area, it is for
letting water drain from this area to keep water out of your heater- a/c fan
intake (which will leak right on top of your fuse/relay panel ) and to keep
standing water from causing rust in the cowl area. You need to keep leaves and
debris out of this area so the "flap" doesn't get clogged which keeps it from
doing its job.
The "flap" is located on the firewall about 4-5" below the coolant reservoir.
Here is an easy way to find it, start at the bottom mount for your passenger
side hood shock, exactly 9" straight down from there you will see an oval black
rubber "thing" about 2" x 4" . That is it.

Happy hunting, ;-)
