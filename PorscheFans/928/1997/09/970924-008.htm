| The stuff you have added to your car sounds like it might well be 
| Molybdenum Disulfide. This is an additive that has been around for 
| decades. I have used it in many different types of engines. The main 
| claim to fame of this compound is that its slippery as heck. I've also 
| added it to a transmission or two (manual of course) and it has generally 
| had good to very good results there as well. Its not the same thing as 
| PTFE/ Teflon

Hi Colin,
You are correct.  MoS2 is molybdenum disulfide.  I use an oil, grease, and 
gear lube which are 100% paraffin base oils and polyalphaolefin (PAO) 
synthetic base fluids manufactured with moly.  Most gearing is designed to 
perform under hydrodynamic lubrication conditions.  That is, a full fluid film 
must separate the metal surfaces of the gears during operation.  However, 
during periods of cold start up or sever shock loads, this film can be 
destroyed or not present.  Unless a boundary lubricant is present in the gear 
oil when this full fluid film is destroyed, wear can take place.  To prevent 
this wear, molybdenum disulfide is blended into the gear lube.  The molybdenum 
disulfide provides the boundary lubrication needed by plating itself to the 
metal surfaces of the gears.  This moly film will withstand pressure up to 
500,000 psi, thus reducing wear and extending equipment life.  Moly also 
provides a smooth finished surface on all moving parts of the gears.  This is 
turn lessens the power demands of the gears, resulting in more power being 
transmitted to gears output.  

I use lubricants with moly in my '83 928 and '90 300E and professionally at 
the power station where I'm the mechanical maintenance engineer.
