<<Hey guys,



Just saw your post.  I live in Williamsburg and am going to the "Frenzy"
also.  I'd like to caravan along if you'd like another "shark".  Let me
know....(I was planning on driving up Sat. morning, but that can change).

We have another 928 in williamsburg now.  But the only questions is, why we
have never seen in prowling around this tiny town.  John Ryall and I are
planning on leaving for D.C. Sat A.M. also.  So let's plan on when and where
to meet.  We should also try to coordinate with the Richmond people, and
anyone else driving up from VA beach, or parts beyond.

Tom-  why don't email me directly or call me at 757.259.0007.

Hey guys,

Just saw your post.  I live in Williamsburg and
am going to the "Frenzy" also.  I'd like to caravan along if you'd like
another "shark".  Let me know....(I was planning on driving up Sat. morning,
but that can change).
