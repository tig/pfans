Hi Sharkfans!

My '83 Euro S (K Jetronic) won't start.

Last time I was having trouble, it turned out to be corroded connector on
the control pressure regulator. Since then it's started OK, but recently
it's taken quite a few cranks to get going. This has slowly deteriated to
the stage where it won't start at all.

I have fuel pressure and I suspect that one of the valves in the fuel
system isn't doing what it's supposed to due to wiring problems.

Tomorrow, I'm going to do resistance tests on all the sensors to try and
pinpoint the fault.

Today, I spent some time looking around the engine compartment, trying to
identify the fuel system components. One that has thrown me completely is
the unit that is strapped to the central crossmember (the pole that goes
across the top of the engine, bolted to each suspension tower. This unit
has a tube (vacuum line?) coming out each end and two wires attached to the
bottom. One of these wires goes to ground, the other into the wiring loom.
What does this unit do?

My interest in this item is due to the fact that someone has spliced
another wire onto the wire the goes into the loom. This wire runs down in
front of the timing belt cover, then disappears off under the engine block.
The wire has been roughly connected, just by twisting it around a bared
portion of the original wire (with the obligatory plastic insulation tape).

Any ideas?

The other thing that has me puzzled is a connector mounted somewhere
near/on the throttle housing. I can see it when I look into throttle system
from the right hand side of the car. The connector has 3 terminals on it,
but there's nothing connected to it. Is this a test connector, or do I have
to start fishing around to find the cable that's supposed to be plugged in
to it?

Thanks for any help anyone can offer.

PS. I'm 2 hours drive from the nearest Porsche 928 mechanic, so I really
need to solve this!

Cheers,
