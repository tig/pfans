Well, yeah I know, it's dangerous to road race, and I have really been good
lately, but ever since I rebuilt my 85 Euro car with the Speed yellow color
and all the mods, I get so many invitations.

So last night I took on a duo composed of a yellow M3 and a yellow lotus,
it must have been quite a sight seeing three yellow exotics racing through
route 9 in Boston at over 100 mph. Anyway, I had a better launch than all
three, but they both passed me at about 40 mph. At around 90 I started
edging back up on them, then at around 125, there was a pretty formidable
curve, and they both applied the brakes, but I powered right through and I
was off, they were chasing me the rest of the way! I have the weltmeister
springs and konis on full hard (OUCH!), technology rims with michelin MXX3
pilot rubber, GTS brakes, a *sick* exhaust, and a few other minor mods.

Anyway, I don't need a lecture about safety, I know it's dangerous and I
really do beat down the urge most of the time. All that yellow had me
excited though.
