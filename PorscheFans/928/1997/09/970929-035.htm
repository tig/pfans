Traction on snow and ice is non-existent.  I live in Wisconsin and would
drive
my 928S4 all year if it was at all possible.  I end up storing mine from
end of
November until March or April.  I"ve also owned earlier model 928's and
even 
though the torque was lower it didn't make enough difference.

Traction on wet or cold pavement is also not terrific.  It is possible
to drive
the 928 like a "regular" car, however, it's still fairly easy to get
loose and 
you have to be careful.
