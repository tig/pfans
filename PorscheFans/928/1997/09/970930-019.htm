Mark,

I enjoyed reading your autrocross post, particularly after
having just joined the PCA and completing my second
event.

These cars are incredibly diverse.  Sheer beauty aside,
they drive at extremely high speeds, they are incredibly
quiet/comfortable/civilized, and they handle with
extraordinary finesse.  Take a look at Mark Anderson's
lead with some stiff competition at the track.  You have
had fantastic success autocrossing on a fast course.
They also do well on tight "914" autocross courses.

Last weekend, my wife and I attended our local PCA 
event and to our dismay, found the course had no
straightaways... a 914 course.  We are beginners, so
we viewed the day as a learning experience.  Gave it
a good solid try and found on this tight course, we 
could do the whole thing in 1st gear (redline @ 48 mph).
Top time of day was around 37 sec, and I got a 40.8.
I was running street D40 M2s on S4 wheels on my non-mod
'86 928 S.  My run was better than most of the 914s, all of
the 911 SC s  a couple of  turbos, and all of the Boxsters.
And the really exciting thing for me is:  I am not a great
driver YET.  Oh, but the potential!   R1s and a little more
experience....     

James

PS  The announcer commented on how quiet the 928 is.
Stealth is good.  

PPS  My wife is getting competitive.  In the coming
months, I will keep the list posted on her "kills",
even if it is me!
