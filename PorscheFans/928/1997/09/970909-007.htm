Ed,
My previous 928 ('86 S US Spec) came with the sealed beam setup
(pretty wimpy  at 100+ if you ask me).  I quickly switched to the Hella set
up, the fit perfectly.

I made a couple of minor modifications though. I bought 60L-100H watt
bulbs to replace the ones that came with the Hellas, I think the Hellas
came with 50/60.  I replaced the front parking lights with 100 watt
halogen backup lamps, and yes they got really hot, but did not discolor
the lens nor did they melt the mounting.
