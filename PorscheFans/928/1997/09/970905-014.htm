The reasons are uninformed, and the data is wrong, but . . . . to a 
degree he's right.    Put a 928 on jack stands and try to work the
doors.    In my experience, the frame has real trouble with this
much stress, and doors will not fit properly until the rubber is back
on the pavement.   

While this generally means that you will always fall a little short
when trying to tune the chassis, THEY CAME OUT OF THE BOX
that way.     

And its nothing these hands have ever been able to feel on the track.
