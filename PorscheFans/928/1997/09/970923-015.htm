I've gotten behind on my E-mail and have been trying to catch up!

Here's my .02 on the home alignment thing -

I attended a local PCA tech session several years ago where they demonstrat=
ed an optical alignment system that one of the people had been using.  I ha=
d been looking for a way to do it myself and was impressed with the accurac=
y of the set-up.  Anyway, to make a long story short, I sent for one of the=
 kits and have been using it successfully ever since.  I've aligned my 914 =
many times, my VW Jetta a few times, and my 928 just last week.

I don't know if this guy's still in business, I bought this kit in Feb of '=
93, but here's the name and address if anyone's interested:

Hit Man Alignment
185 Pleasant Way
Penfield, NY  14526

Phone # (716) 381-0728

The kit cost me $120.00 plus $20.00 for adapters back in '93.  I've sure sa=
ved a lot of money on alignments since then!
