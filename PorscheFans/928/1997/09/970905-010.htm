	No, I understood your point.  Really!  And I don't want you to get upset b/c
to me this is just a lively conversation!  What everyone has to remember that
Porsche cars are built in Europe, by Europeans, who have a different attitude
towards cars and driving than Americans.  If Porsche wanted to build an
engine for Indy, NASCAR, or any other race you could bet like the sun rising
in the east every morning that they would dominate.  Look at Mercedes in Indy
car.  But that isn't racing to the Europeans (nor to me).  Sure Top Fuel
dragsters are fast, but they rebuild their engines EVERY TIME they run.
 Porsche can run their new GT-1 in races all year without major work (barring
a crash).
	928's aren't, and weren't ever meant to be stoplight racers.  They are
grand-tourers, like a Mercedes 600SL, Aston Martin, or Ferrari 412/456GT.
 They were made heavy but with lots of torque and horsepower for a reason -
to be fast and comfortable, not just because Porsche had an excess of
cowhides, wiring, and electrical motors.  Even my 930 doesn't have lots of
low end torque (like a Mustang or Vette).  That's not how Porsche builds
cars.  And I'm not just blowing off b/c I don't like American cars- my last
two Mustangs and Vettes were a 1991 GT with an 8lb Paxton supercharger, a
1993 Cobra, an 86 Corvette Coupe and a 1968 Corvette roadster with a 427/435
hp, and I can honestly say that if you put all 4 of those cars together they
wouldn't begin to equal the quality or driving fun of either of my Porsches.
 Just like with a Rolex.  Will a $20,000 all gold President have a stop watch
built in so that you can time yourself at the track like a $20 Wal-Mart watch
will?  No, but it wasn't designed for that reason.  Is a Rolex worth the
price?  Absolutely.  You aren't just buying a Porsche or Rolex, you're buying
history, insight, sweat, technology, quality, reliability, etc.  Just because
a car has an internal combustion engine doesn't mean you should line up on
Sat. night with a pimply-faced kid on "the strip."  I don't race the
goofballs here in town who cruise, not b/c I would get beat (I wouldn't), but
b/c my Porsche is above that.  It has a mystique about it that I don't want
to compromise by racing a Mustang on Green River Road in Evansville, IN- what
an accomplishment!  All I'm trying to get across is that you may be trying to
make something out of a 928 that it was never supposed to be.  I'd feel a lot
better about the whole deal if you took a Vette and improved it by adding 928
suspension than taking a 928 a ruining it with a Chevy motor.  Anyway- sorry
for the bandwidth.  Just wanted to start some more trouble.      :-)
Can I get an amen?!
