>>*  89 928GT - REAR BUMPER COVER - Perfect Condition with all Hardware - Update
>>your Early 928 to the S4/GT Look - $570

>First, your bumper cover price is on the high side. IMHO.

My price is $570 which includes license plate holder, license plate lights, body
seal, lower panel supports, and every nut and bolt needed for install etc.
If you look around and double check your info you will find that 928
International sells them for $650 for just the bumper cover and most junk yards
sell them for around $1000

>Second, 'updating an early 928' is fiendishly complex and expensive.

It might be for you, but I can do it in about 3-4 hours. Of course, I do this
kind of stuff  a lot and know what I am talking about from experience , not what
others tell me.!!

Check again, the stock lighting inner panels are part of the bumper cover.

WHOOOAAAAA. What IDIOT told you that??? I have done this 3 times so far, the 90
degree lip you speak of is on the plastic bumper cover and is trimmed with an
exacto knife, then the lower part of the bumper cover comes over top of the
existing metal rear fender lip and is attached with 3M adhesive just like the
rest of the S4 body sills. No metal work is needed, that is if you know what you
are doing.
The ONLY PAINTING required is to match the bumper cover to your existing car
color.


>Exclusive of parts, the rear bumper 'update' can easily cost $1,000 in labor.
I will do it for anyone for $200, excluding paint.

>As for parts, in addition to the bumper cover, you will need the late
>bumper bar,
Not True

>rubber bumperettes
Not True.

 >tail light  and
Package price with bumper cover and hardware $750 or $125 ea.

>license light assemblies
Included with bumper cover.

>and beading for the bumper-to-body seam.
Included see above.


>Assuming  you can sell the old parts (and I've been trying for 3 years to
>sell an early rear bumper cover), the conversion is about $1,600.

Doing it your way, I don't doubt it.

>The front conversion is even more expensive.

Front bumper Changeover is same as rear, Piece OF Cake!!!

Bill,
Next time be a man and e-mail me directly if you have questions or comments
concerning my parts, I think it was kind of CHICKEN SH*T to send this to the
PorscheFans site and not even CC me the E-Mail. Plus I am sure no one else wants
to see this CRAP.
