First of all, thanks to all of you who wrote back with fender prices, my
'85 "S" will be going into the body shop next week.

1]  Synthetic oil - I have run Castrol Syntec 5/50 ever since I bought the
car two years ago.  At 122,000 kms [say, 75,000 miles], the oil consumption
works out to about one American quart per two thousand miles.  I change it
at 12,000 km intervals [approx 7500 miles], and I pre-fill my filter before
installation.  Although I don't drive the car in our Canadian winter, our
spring and fall temperature extremes are such that the 5/50 spectrum covers
all bases.  I also run this oil in my Civic Si and my AWD Aerostar and I'm
convinced that this oil has added to both our winter cold-start capability
and the heavy-duty towing capability of our Aerostar.  After a long hot run
in the '28, oil pressure will sit at about 3.5 bar at idle, which is within
Porsche tolerance.  I'm sold on the product.
2]  Tires:  I switched to Bridgestone S-02's in original 225/50-16 sizing
last spring.  After two autocrosses and 10,000 kilometres, they're showing
very little wear.  They're very expensive, but I believe the extra cost is
justified by the obvious longevity and superior handling characteristics of
the tire.
3]  Vanity plates - my '28 runs the plate TOTHE9S.  I originally had it on
my [long-gone and lamented] 914/6, and in five or six years, I'll transfer
it to a premium used 3 litre '98 or '99 Boxster "S" that will be coming off
some lease somewhere.  Jokes and transferrability are good things...

Best wishes to all,
Dave Jorgensen
