But like they say, how fast do you want to go?  A 6-liter 928 S4 would


I'm not out to set any records or catch the world on fire, just want enough
to stomp the occsional delusional punk and thier hot rod. I'm also  lazy
and broke so that's gotta be factored into the equation. That means pretty
much common parts that can be thrown together fast to get considerablyy
better than average results. While I haven't driven a 928 the appealing
part of them was porsche's head design and a suspicion that they might drive good and have a stiff frame, which they may.

  Still it looks like I'd better start with something a little simpler.
