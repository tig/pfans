     Greg, I'll try to answer some of your questions:
     
     >Doesn't your GT already have a stiffer suspension than my 87' S4? 
     The workshop manual doesn't show different spring rates for the GT.
     
     >Mine has the "sport" shocks option, so maybe fairly close? 
     Maybe.
     
     >Is your GT suspension otherwise stock?
     I have lowered the front adjustable spring perch heights from the 
     stock location and adjusted the front camber spec to -1.5 degrees. 
     Still use factory springs and factory Boge Gas shocks. That's all.
     
     >Do you think these wheels are comparible in construction and quality 
     >to the Porsche wheels?  (or at least, the aftermarket versions of 
     >Porsche wheels) In your opinion, can they be "tracked" without 
     >breaking?
     I believe the wheel construction and quality is good, but not up to 
     the standards of the Porsche factory wheels. Since they are TUV rated 
     I believe they can be driven hard without breaking. My GT came with 
     the 7.5 F and 9.0 R cast factory wheels and I use those for track and 
     auto-x.
     
     >Are they truely hub-fitting?  Any problems with wheel balance/ 
     >vibrations?   
     When I first received the wheels, they did not fit on the front of the 
     944S2 because they were too tight. Tire Rack paid to have them 
     returned, machined, and reshipped to my front door. They fit good on 
     the 928. They use different lug nuts which have a V-taper so I do not 
     believe that they are truely hub-centric. No problems with balance.
     
     >Are the spokes full diameter round?
     The spokes are more rectangular than round with the sides being curved 
     surfaces. Three sides are visible and the backside is hollowed out so 
     they are actually U-shaped in cross-section.
     
     >Do you think that 225-40's will rub? 
     Since they are smaller diameter and narrower, they are less likely to.
     
     >Is it the body lower cladding that you had to trim the body color 
     >cladding?....and how much did you have to trim for the 235-40's? 
     >(just the bottom corner, or the whole height of the cladding?)    
     Yes is was the plastic body color cladding. I don't know if this piece 
     is a GT thing or if it is on S4's also. It wraps under the car behind 
     the front tire overhanging the angled metal lip of the fender. Imagine 
     a 90 degree corner of plastic. I used a hacksaw and cut a 30 degree 
     angle across the plastic corner about and inch in length so it was 
     flush to the existing metal lip.
     
     >What is your tire sidewall to fender clearance in the rear with the 
     >265-35's?(assuming that is your rear size, as you didn't say 
     >otherwise) Do you think I could I go any wider on the rear? 
     I do have the 265-35's and I can put my open hand between the tire and 
     the fenderwell. I believe you could use a wider rear tire.
     
     >Do you happen to know the offsets of these wheels? 
     I am not sure but I think they are 40mm.
     
     >Have these wheels kept their appearance well? 
     >(one thing I like is they look easy to clean)
     These wheels are the easiest ever to clean with their smooth surfaces 
     and no tight corners. The finish still looks as they were new.
     
     >Do these wheels look ok even with the car not lowered any? 
     The 18's look great at the stock ride height. 
     
     >Does it look funny with the wheels being so much wider and the tires 
     >not being 1.5"  and 2.0" wider to match?
     225mm=8.85inch tire on 8.5 inch wheel and 265mm=10.4inch on 10 wheel 
     give a vertical side wall appearence and the 18inch tires have a rim 
     protector groove in the sidewall that wraps around and protects the 
     rim as there is not much sidewall height for protection. Don't know 
     if 17's have this.
     
     >My car is Diamantblua Metallic, and is probably similar in color to 
     >the wheels themselves. (what color is yours?)
     My car is Guards Red. The silver finish is a similar color to the 
     factory wheels but have more gloss.
     
     If you plan on lowering the car with stiffer springs you may want to 
     stay with the 17inch wheels as this combination may be uncomfortably 
     stiff. I like my current setup and don't plan to change springs. I 
     hope this helps in your decision.
