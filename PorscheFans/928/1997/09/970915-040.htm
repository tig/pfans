Hello Fellow Sharks.
The count stands at 50 registered. this past Sunday the Potomac Region had a
Swap meet where I was able to talk to a few vendors that had 928 "stuff". In
addition to some part being available for sale, there may also be a merchant
who cuts 928 keys. Although the swap meet did not have alot of 928 stuff, I
did manage to find a few items like 928 pins and post cards.

BTW, if you are not sure about the directions to the event, you can always
give me a call, or if you know your way around the internet, try using the
Lycos or Yahoo or Excite destination maps. Enter your departure address and
then enter the address for ASG as the destination.

One more travel advisory "thing". I am not sure why, but is perfectly legal
in VA. to drive in any lane at the minimum speed limit. As dangerous and
annoyoing as it may be, passing on the right is permitted and sometimes is
the only way to get around. Quite offen I find that traveling in the extreme
right lane is both faster and less crowded than the extreme left lane. Go
figure. Happy motoring. Ed
