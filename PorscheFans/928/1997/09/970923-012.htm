I would think that it would be comparable to tire compounds as they relate 
to track conditions.

Certain jellies have a very high "sticksion" factor.  Particularly the high 
end or Z rated jellies.  Therefore I can see no problem in maintaining 
adhesion to the bottom of the wing. This does bring up a point as to 
relative coefficients of friction between the PB and J.  If a high C of F 
jelly is used, would the resulting pressure deferential be diminished? 
 Therefore reducing the downforce gain.  Or could this be considered a 
method of fine tuning of the rear downforce.

As in all new technologies, there will need to be much development work 
performed to truly understand and optimize the process and benefits.

Once again, I will welcome further technical input and debate in order to 
further the performance of the 928.

Good Day,
