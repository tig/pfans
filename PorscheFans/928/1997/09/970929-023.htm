Hi John & Leonard,
I had to jump in on this one.
 For the average driver a limited slip on snow and especially ice is an accident
waiting to happen. In the hands of an experienced slick surface driver it can be
an asset, to a point.
An "open" differential will not get the traction , but on the other hand when
one tire is spinning the other acts like an anchor to keep the car from sliding
sideways., whereas the limited slip will get traction to a point and then (if
prudence is not used )both will spin sending the car to the ditch or swapping
ends.

Most of us hard-core off-road guys use "air-lockers" or the equivalent because
we can run open diffs on ice etc on the road and then off-road we can lock the
diffs together for maximum traction and mud slinging. It is the best of both
worlds. I wonder if we could talk ARB into making an Air Locker for a 928. :o)

Next Subject:
The highlight of the VA Frenzy was getting to meet so many of you guys that I
have been corrosponding with on the 928 Site. For once you West Coast guys
missed out instead of us East Coast guys always missing the fun ;-)
