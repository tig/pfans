Kurt,

The "kill of the week" was my idea and it had nothing to do with high speed.
My concept was simply capture zero to 65 times that put to shame the posers.

It's an added bonus my car that was never designed to drag race (yes, all the
way up to that legal speed limit). It would be even more pleasurable to pull 
up in a clapped out Jag w/ a stroker conversion beside someone with a brand 
new Viper and show them up by smoking them up to the legal speed limit. The
added bonus of utilizing the 928 is that it's _known_ for its handling and 
top end in a luxury package, not its quickness. And it's such a beautiful car!

So imagine the suprise and humiliation of the humbled Z-28/Corvette/Mustang
/M3/RX-7 drivers...they're outdone in every possible arena. Capture that
expression on tape and you've got _my_ concept of "The Kill of the Week". 

Everytime I fantasize about this, I envision a particular road here in Austin
which lends itself in a safe manner. It's a 6 lane, median divided, wide 
shouldered road which has no entrances or exits to suburbs, and no driveways
or convenient store parking lots for at least a quarter mile past each of
the many, half mile spaced traffic lights.

In no way do I condone deadly high speed chases. If other list-users want to
share stories of such, I would appreciate it if they picked their own title
for that story...not "the kill of the week". How 'bout "chasing death"?
