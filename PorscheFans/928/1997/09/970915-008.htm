>*  89 928GT - REAR BUMPER COVER - Perfect Condition with all Hardware - Update
>your Early 928 to the S4/GT Look - $570

----------------------

I think this needs to be put in pespective:

First, your bumper cover price is on the high side. IMHO.

Second, 'updating an early 928' is fiendishly complex and expensive.

The tail light assemblies will not fit the stock inner panels. You will
have to cut out those areas and re-weld to provide 3/4" more depth for the
late lights.

The quarter panels must be chopped off and flanged to match the late bumper
cover, which comes forward to the wheelwell. This cannot be done without
repainting the rear quarters.

Exclusive of parts, the rear bumper 'update' can easily cost $1,000 in labor.

As for parts, in addition to the bumper cover, you will need the late
bumper bar, rubber bumperettes, tail light  and license light assemblies
and beading for the bumper-to-body seam.

Assuming  you can sell the old parts (and I've been trying for 3 years to
sell an early rear bumper cover), the conversion is about $1,600. The front
conversion is even more expensive.

YMMV
