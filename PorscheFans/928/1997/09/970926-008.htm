I recently joined the mailing list and found it to be quite useful.

I bought a 93 GTS in April of 95 from a Porsche dealer with 12k miles on it.

It's previous owner was a Porsche area rep so I assume it was taken care of.
I found the car to burn 1QT/480 miles after 6k miles of dealer monitoring of 
the oil
consumption. Fortunately I bought a extended warranty and was able to have 
PCNA
pay for a complete rebuild (new block,pistons,rings,bearings,valve 
seats,valve seals etc).

I used conventional oil for the break in and after 5k miles switched to 
5w-50 Mobil 1. It looks like the oil burning is not much better ~1Qt/500 
miles. I had the dealer change the oil after the first 2k miles and it 
appeared that the the burn rate was ~1QT/1000 miles (looking at the dip 
stick) then after the first oil change I was back to 1Qt/500 miles.

I have talked to 4 other GTS owners, all who say they burn oil ranging from 
1Qt/600 miles to
1Qt/3000 miles.

The manual says  1 liter/1000km (1 qt/680 miles) as normal, and excessive as 
starting at 1.5
liter/1000km.

What are you other GTS owners seeing as rate of consumption, what kind of 
oil are you using,
and what are your driving conditions (hot climate, hills, hi-RPM driving).

Also, I timed the car from 20 to 100 MPH to see if the motor is healthy and 
it is. My times were
about equal to the low times of the published data.

20-40 1.8 sec
30-50 2.3 sec
40-60 2.5 sec
50-70 2.5 sec
60-80 2.9 sec
70-90 3.1 sec
80-100 4 sec

Tests were done with two people in the car (in traffic) and nearly bald P700 
Z tires that snapped
loose when i punched it rolling at 20 mph clutch out. It runs like a champ.

Happy but concerned 928 Owner
93 928 GTS
90 Cherokee (1 QT/ 3k miles)
96 MaterCraft 350 LT1 (no oil burn)
