Hi all,

The Frenzy was AWESOME!  I want to thank everyone involved for all their ha=
rd work in putting on such a great event.

Thanks to Ed Ruiz for all the planning, coordinating, scheduling, advertisi=
ng, presenting, and sharing of a wealth of 928 knowledge (and God knows wha=
t else he did) that I'm sure took countless hours of his time.

Thanks to Kim Crumb for attending and unselfishly sharing his knowledge, an=
swering countless questions all day, and just being an all around "good guy=
".  (I never got to see his race videos, was too involved listening to Larr=
y Reynold's presentation).

Thanks to Larry Reynold for his great demos on Stephane's nice red car ( to=
o bad you couldn't get him to finish detailing the whole car, 'eh Stephane?=
) and for providing free samples and door prizes.

Thanks to Mark and Susan of DEVEK for being there, sharing their 928 knowle=
dge and expertise, answering countless questions (sure were a lot of questi=
ons that day - lots of answers too) and also for providing some really nice=
 door prizes.

Thanks to 928 International for their support and the door prizes they prov=
ided.

Thanks to ASG for allowing us all to use their great facility to have the F=
renzy.

Thanks to all the people I never had a chance to meet who worked so hard to=
 make this event a success.  =


I know I've probably left some important people out, and I apologize profus=
ely for that, but thank you so much.

Also, thanks to Brian and John for making the drive up and back a great tim=
e too!

Seeing so many 928's crusing over to the photo location, chirping tires, an=
d thundering along was awesome!  Oh yeah, thanks Brian and John for picking=
 out such a good photo spot!

Well, as you can all tell, I had a great time and have lots of memories I w=
on't soon forget.  I can't wait 'till "Frenzy Vie" next year.  Let's keep t=
he momentum going!  "Bodies in motion tend to stay in motion", right Leonar=
d?  Hey, are you really a Physicist?  Sorry, I didn't get to talk to you mu=
ch... too much to do, too little time...

Oh well, I'm starting to ramble now. Better quit while I'm behind (or befor=
e I become a behind).

Thanks again everybody!  In my mind it was a huge success!
