There was a posting several days ago - questions about
Oil-Additives.  The answers that were posted had me concerned
about adding such compounds to my 84 928S.  One answer stated
that one of the by-products produced by Teflon when it breaks
down, is acidic.  Now, lets see - acid and aluminum - hmmmmm.

Now this is a prime example of the benefit of participating in
this forum - I can honestly say that I probably would have added
a "Slick-50" type product in the near future and would have paid
the $erious consequences for my ignorance.  

Some time before I read this posting, I purchased a "Super-Lube"
type product and was awaiting its arrival through the mail.  The
product is "LM MOS2 ANTI-FRICTION ENGINE TREATMENT" and a can of
which treats 4 quarts of engine oil.  The catalog stated that it
was Porsche factory approved.  Well, the stuff arrived, but I still
thought of that post (acid, acid/aluminum, disolving-aluminum, etc).

I decided to call Performance products up and find out if there were
any fine-print or exclusions to their claim.  After voicing my
concern to the Customer Rep, he said they had a Porsche tech that
worked at the factory there, and he would ask him.  After about
5 min, he came back and said that it has been approved for aluminum
and cast block engines.

OK then....

I added it, my hand shaking ever so slightly.  Drove to work 
the next day (about 8 mi), and noticed that the engine SOUNDED
different - and seemed to be more responsive to the accelerator.
It got up to temp by the time I parked it.  When I left for the 
day, I watched the Tach (remembering how my Honda acted with 
the Slick-50) and after starting the cold engine, I gained about
400 RPM on the initial Idle. I let the car warm until the idle
kicked down, and drove home the Highway route.  Much improved
throttle response, and it seemed less vibration.  On the final
strech of road, the last stop-sign before pulling in, I nailed it
and the tires lost contact with the road for the first time
I've owned the car.  Very happy and relieved about that!

Now, Please tell me, did the guy at Performance Products lie
to me?  Is my block going to begin to bleed 20/50 anytime
in the future?

By the way, I was the guy that asked the question about the mushy
transmission performance last night.  It's no longer a concern...

Good or bad news - let me have it!

Thanks again to the brain-trust.
