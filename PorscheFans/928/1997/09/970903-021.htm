"The other thing that has me puzzled is a connector mounted somewhere
near/on the throttle housing. I can see it when I look into throttle 
system
from the right hand side of the car. The connector has 3 terminals on it,
but there's nothing connected to it. Is this a test connector, or do I 
have
to start fishing around to find the cable that's supposed to be plugged 
in
to it?"

This sounds suspiciously like it should be the throttle position sensor! 

As for your other item, no idea. One clue is that there are two vacuum 
lines. This suggests that its an electrical signal controlling the vacuum 
and not the other way round. I would follow the vacuum line first and see 
where the source and destination are.
