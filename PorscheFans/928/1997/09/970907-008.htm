Ok,

First off, thanks for all the help all of you have provided for my 
questions in the past.  The car is coming along slowly but surely.  I 
have put over 3000 miles of my own now and am getting very used to 
driving it :-)

Here's the latest little annoyance.  My drivers window now works only 
intermittantly.  I wouldn't think any of you would be able to help me 
as intermittant problems are a bear to troubleshoot, but I discovered 
a consistancy that may be just the clue needed.  

Each time I turn on the car now I check to see if the window works.  
Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  Here's the cool part.  As 
long as the car is on it either ALWAYS works or ALWAYS doesn't.  This 
leads me to believe it's not a short in the wiring but maybe some 
other problem.  Does anyone know enough about the relays and such to 
figure this one out?

Thanks in advance.

V-
