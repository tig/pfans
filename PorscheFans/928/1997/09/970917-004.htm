No way.

1.  Replace front tires immediately - with cord showing you are in danger of
a blowout at ANY time!!!  Do this now, preferably taking them off the car
first so as not endanger yourself further by driving more!!!

2.  Alignment is wack.  You need to find a shop that knows how to properly
align a 928 and this doesn't necessarily mean the dealer, who's mechanics
are probably more 911-centric anyways and their 928 training is lost?

Check your tires more often!!!
