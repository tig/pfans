I've been enjoying the posts on "kills of the week" and it reminded me of
my first encounter with a 928 when I became the kill of the week.  In a
way, you may be contributing to increased future interest in the 928 when
you make your "kills"...

It was about 10 years ago as I was pulling out of a toll booth here in
Richmond that I noticed in my rear view mirror a light green S4 as it was
pulling up to the gate.  I had an '85 Mustang GT that I had recently
stomped a 911 with so I thought I was pretty fast.  I floored it just to
let the 928 driver hear the power of my Ford 5.0 liter, 4 barrel engine.  I
figured that'd be as close to me as he'd get.  I kept it floored thru first
and as I shifted into second gear, I checked my rear view mirror.  The 928
was way back, just getting out of the toll booth but I could see he was
leaving FAST.  This toll both was on an 8-lane expressway with little
traffic at the time so we had lots of room to run.  Well, the next time I
looked in my mirror, he was right behind me.  I still had it floored,
getting ready to shift into 3rd.   I knew I was toast and as he went by me
at 90+ mph, I looked over at him.  I think he was tuning his radio or
something - he just blew by me like I wasn't even there and he was just
driving routinely.

Right then and there, with my mouth still agape, I started formulating a
plan to one day own one of those things.

P.S.  To all of you planning to attend the "Frenzy", please post all about
it next week for those of us who can't make it.  I was looking forward to
attending and meeting a bunch of you guys, but will not be able to.
