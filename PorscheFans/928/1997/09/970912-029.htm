As you've noted in most of my prior messages, my 928 is currently at the
body shop.  It has been there since last March.  At lunch today, I
stopped by to check on progress (knowing that it had moved from the 'to
do' pile into the 'working' pile).

I immediately saw that the hood and hatch were painted!   YIPPEE!
And, they looked great!   OH - FOR JOY!   Lemme see here........the
front bumper cover looks, um, fantastic!    Now, moving back to the rear
bumper cover (a perfect used unit purchased by me to replace a badly
mangled original piece).......hmmmmm.....looks very
good........hmmmmmmm??????........hole for the (rare) rear fog light on
the driver side..........there's the hole for the rear fog light on the
passenger side......WHAH-THE-****!!!!?????   THEY CUT TWO HOLES IN THE
PERFECT COVER FOR THE FOG LIGHT!
$!^%!*!%!#!^%!&***(*^$$##$%)!&&*!@$%&!%!$$^&!

I'm picking the car up next week - and I'm locating another bumper cover
this afternoon.   The car looks great, but unfortunately it'll be awhile
before the body is whole again.   :{(

Thanks for the shoulders, folks......will letcha know what develops.
