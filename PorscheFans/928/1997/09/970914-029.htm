Over here in NZ things run a little differently.

I believe you guys get issued a new plate every year?

This is how licensing happens over here:

The "number plates" are issued for the car when it is registered, screwed
onto the car and stay with the car until the day it dies. They are of the
format XXNNNN.

"Personalised plates" are 6 digits maximum. You don't have to assign them
to a car to own them. You can invest in a plate and not even have it
manufactured.

I own:

AARRGH
001000 << figure that one out!
OOIOIO

and one other I can't remember.

When you pay your annual licence fee, you get a thin plastic card with your
reg number, current year, and barcode on it. This is slipped into a plastic
pocket on the inside of the windscreen.

Cheers,
