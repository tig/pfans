I think Mobil 1 offers 0W40 in Europe and they have introduced 0W30 here
in the US.  Maybe they know something you don't?  BTW, do you work for
Redline, or just buy their overpriced oil?

ANY synthetic will.

I doubt it.  I've been using 5W50 Castrol Syntec for over 98,000 miles in
my '92 Honda Civic Si and the engine runs better than the day it was new
almost 6 years ago.  It uses no oil whatsoever during a normal 5-7,000
mile change interval.

I don't see any deposits in my cylinder head when I change the oil.
Syntec does tend to darken the surface color of the aluminum, but it's as
clean as can be otherwise.

Cheers,
