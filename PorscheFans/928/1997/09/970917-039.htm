Dear fellow Land Shark tamers.
Here are a few personal experiences that may help answer questions posed
today. James Morrison is absolutely correct about the 928 alignment.
Actually, to be done properly, it takes three adjustments of each adjustable
setting. In addition, even the best qualified technician can not align the
car within factory specs if it is TOO LOW. Even if you have not lowered your
car, over time ALL 928 original springs tend to sag and allow the car to get
too low. Thus, the car must first be brought back within the acceptable
height range, and then it can be aligned. If you like the LOW look on your
928, just be ready to fork out the bucks for tires every 10K miles or less.

Recently my car began to run a bit hot (at or slightly above the top white
line). The coolant  had been replaced (with 100% phosphate free) as well as
the thermostat and water pump. The problem was a weak fan clutch. Since the
repair it rarely approaches the upper white line even on the 105 degree day
we had over a month ago. Once I'm moving it barely makes it above the lower
white line. Check out the fan clutch. They do get weak over time. My car is
an 86 with over 121K miles. Twelve years on the original fan clutch is
probably about what you should expect.

OK. The Frenzy has 52 registered and more on the way. I plan to be at "ASG"
at about 7:30 am. Only my staff of volunteers will be allowed in before
8:00. Check-in will start at 8:00. There will be the customary "PCA
Insurance Waiver" to sign and receipt of meal tickets for those that
pre-registered on time. As of this date there will be two check-in lines;
A-N and O-Z. If the number of registrants is substantially more than 60,
there will be a third line.

Coffee, tea, juice, soft drinks, water, bagels, croissants, doughnuts and
muffins will be on sale. Your pre-paid lunch will be a slice of a "6' party
sub" and a bag of chips. There will be an additional charge for each extra
sub-slice or bag of chips. (For $5 I hope you didn't expect shrimp on the
"bar-B".)

I suggest you wear comfortable shoes and layered clothes. Bring a note pad,
pens, a camera and a tape recorder if you like. Up to 9:00 you are free to
move about the shop. BTW, there will be lots to see and spend money (cash or
checks) on. Larry Reynolds from "Car Care Specialties" will have a ton of
cleaning products (he can take credit cards). "DEVEK Performance" and "928
International" will have lots of items specific to 928s, and Dave Roberts
will have plenty of parts to see and buy. There may even be a fellow from PA
that cuts 928 keys and has other neat stuff as well.

To facilitate networking, I'll post a list of all registrants with their
name, city and state and event registration number (no phone numbers or
street addresses). Find the person(s) living near you (using the name and
registration number) and exchange information as you like.

At 9:00 sharp I will give an overview of the day's activities, introduce the
Sponsors, Guest speaker, and Give him the floor. Due to the nature of the
facility and the number of participants, I ask that you give him your
undivided attention. If you must have sometine to say of benefit to the
group wait until you are called upon. If it's a conversation with someone
else, please do so elsewhere where you will not be heard by the rest of us.
Others around you came a long distance to hear what Kim Crumb has to say.

At registration and for the rest of the early morning please forgive me if I
seem unwilling to converse with you, but I will be rather preoccupied
attending to the responsibilities and duties of getting the event started.
Once things settle down, I hope to meet and talk with everyone registered.


Happy motoring, especially those of you that will be on the road to the
Frenzy in VA. Ed
