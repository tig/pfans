My first kill:

Right after purchasing my 84S I had to drive to a small city 70 miles west 
of my hometown on a rural turnpike which is always deserted. At this point 
the car was still relatively new to me and I had not really opened it up. As 
I was cruising along at about 85 mph, I saw a red car approaching from 
behind quickly. It was a 300 ZX w/ a guy and a girl in it. As they passed 
me, the girl looked over laughing.

Of course, I could not let this happen. I floored my red S and felt that 
second passing gear. They had pulled ahead by several hundred yard by the 
time I got up to speed and it took a few moments to "reel" them in, but 
gradually I did. (Does anyone else have the problem of your windshield 
wipers crawling up the window over 130 mph). I think they were shocked when 
I passed.  The book number for top speed is wrong as I was still 
accelerating at that point, but got "cold feet" before ever reaching top 
speed.

The best part is that I was no where close to redline, temperature remained 
down and at 120 the car felt like someone sprayed "stickum" on the tires and 
it was rock solid. After a few miles, I looked back at an empty highway.

I'm older now, wiser and really a pretty safe driver and haven't done this 
since, but I know at any time, I have the horses if I need them.
