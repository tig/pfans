I love my 79 928 but it's starting to get cold here in Jersey.  I have a 
opportunity to store my car for the winter and i would like to ask if
there are certain things that i should do.  this is the first car that
i've owned that i ever considered storing.  i was only thinking about it 
because of all of the salt they use around here and sometime it snows
alot and not to mention the deadly black ice.  i'd hate to get stuck on
a unplowed road.  i know it's a little early to think about it but the
knowledge would help me plan better incase there are things i need to
purchase(you know that other b word...budget).  thanks in advance.
