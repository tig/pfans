<<If you own (not finance) the car, and don't drive too wild, consider

dropping the collision insurance. Saves me around $ 500 each 6 months...>>

Not so sure that I agree with this one.  I know I'll catch a lot of flames
for my answer, but here goes.  I don't insure my cars because I think I am a
bad driver, I insure them because I know other people are bad drivers.  You
can be driving along doing everything right and still get T-boned or
rear-ended.  If this gentleman is worrying about the cost of keeping a 928 up
just wait until he has to properly repair one after an accident!  To answer
his question honestly and from my experience, a 928 is NOT an affordable car,
esp if it is going to be your only car.  They are reliable and very well
built, but even routine maintenance can be very expensive.  You may never
have any problems with one, but can you afford a $3,000 repair if one comes
up?  Buy something where you will have a little bit of money left over for
surprises.

P.S. An easier way to save money on insurance is to have it listed as a
limited usage/pleasure vehicle.
