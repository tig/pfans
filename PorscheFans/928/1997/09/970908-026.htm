I'm not particularly proud of this, but soon after buying my '83 S, 
the timing belt broke, with no damage to the tender bits.  The belt 
broke, either as I turned the car off, or when I tried to start it 
 again (as in..it wouldnt start & turned over much faster than usual) 
The teeth had been stripped off sections of the belt..pretty nasty. 
I'll second (third? fourth?) the suggestion to replace your timing 
belt immediately after purchasing a 928. $400 is worth the peace of 
mind..mine broke 200+ miles from home. After an unplanned 2-day 
vacation, the new belt was on & I was on my way.   Of course, being 
inexperienced in the ways of 928, I didn't have the water pump done, 
too, which would have been a good idea...they seem to have about the 
same lifespan as the belt...and the 911-oriented mechanic I went to 
conveniently neglected to mention this.

>  (!?!)  Am I just lucky or what!?
If you are, that makes two of us...
