>  Doesn't your GT already have a stiffer suspension than my 87' S4?
>  Mine has the "sport" shocks option, so maybe fairly close?
>  Is your GT suspension otherwise stock?
>  Do you think these wheels are comparible in construction and quality to
the

>  In your opinion, can they be "tracked" without breaking?
>  Are they truely hub-fitting?  Any problems with wheel balance/ vibrations?
  
> 
>  Are the spokes full diameter round?
>  Do you think that 225-40's will rub? 
>  Is it the body lower cladding that you had to trim the body color
>  cladding?....and how much did you have to trim for the 235-40's? (just the
>  bottom corner, or the whole height of the cladding?)    
>  What is your tire sidewall to fender clearance in the rear with the
265-35's?
> 
>   (assuming that is your rear size, as you didn't say otherwise) 
>  Do you think I could I go any wider on the rear?
>  Do you happen to know the offsets of these wheels?
>  Have these wheels kept their appearance well?
>  (one thing I like is they look easy to clean)
>  Do these wheels look ok even with the car not lowered any?
>  Does it look funny with the wheels being so much wider and the tires not
>  being 1.5"  and 2.0" wider to match?
>  My car is Diamantblua Metallic, and is probably similar in color to the
>  wheels themselves. (what color is yours?)          I think they'd look
great
>  on my car, but I don't want to make the car ride like a buckboard.
