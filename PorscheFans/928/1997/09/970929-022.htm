Doesn't have to be very hot....happened after driving in-town
for about 10 minutes.  Disconnected battery ground for 60 seconds,
and it started immediately.

Can't tell if it's spark or fuel....motor spins fast (so batt is fine),
but
never even fires once....which makes me think spark, since surely 
there would be some fuel in the system.
