Uh, D) None of the above.  Haven't done a lot of suspension stuff yet
but starting to work through the equations.  You can probably search the
Yale www site and find out that I'm B.S. Lehigh University in
Engineering Physics and Ph.D. U. Colorado Boulder in Physics.  While
I've been around cars for quite a few years, I only recently started
doing more serious driving things.  (I do have the training however to
try to work out some of it on my own.)

Shoot!  Yeah, I wrote it in Word and then pasted into Netscape.  Should
be 180 [d(back)-d(front)] /(25x2x12xpi)  where d is in inches.  Here we
just approximating the sine of the angle as the angle in radians and
then converting to degrees.  To get toe measured in inches (for a 25"
tire diameter), just do 25x[d(back)-d(front)] /(25x2x12).

Best,
