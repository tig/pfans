  George, I am "bouncing" your message to the 928 Porschefans list where
people
with more knowledge of your situation can be found.  I strongly suggest
that you
subscribe to the list to further discuss you situation
(http://www.porschefans.com).

But, in my opinion:

I have heard of people restarting engine that have been sitting for a
long while and I have
not heard of someone replacing the valve spring.  It is true that some
of the valve
spring might have been under compression for all this time but there is
also the possiblilty
that they were not.  A big component of your problem is what was the
condition of the
car when it was stored and how was the car stored.

If the car was in good working condition when you stored it and it has
not been
sitting in an open field since, I would do the following;

1. Remove all gas from the tank
2. Change the gas filter
3. Put some fresh gas  in the tank
4. change the oil and oil filter
        - Fill the new oil filter prior to installing it on the car, it
will reduce the time required
            for the oil to reach the valvetrain
5. inspect the air filter and the air pump filter, replace if required
6. Remove the battery from the car and charge it
7. look at the spark plug and make sure they are in good condition
8. Inspect the brakes, the wheel might be seized of the humidity was
very high and
    rust formed.  The brakes system will need at a very minimum that the
fluid be
    changed.  Pads and disk might also be required
9. Inspect the belts on the car, The timing belt will need to be changed
soon due to the
    mileage on the car (the water pump should be changed a this time)
10. Check the coolant level.
11. Try to start the car
12. If the car started and you established that the brakes were in good
condition, take the
    car for a GENTLE ride, just enough to get the engine warmed up.

If the car start, I would run it gently for a short period of time and
then do another oil
change.  By short period of time, I mean maybe 10 to 30 miles worth.  I
would then
change the belts on the car and do a complete tune up including all
fluid change.

This of course is at your own risk and the safest way to do this would
be to get the car
flatbed to a mechanic for them to start the car, if not take the engine
apart and do an
thourough cleaning.  I am not sure if there would be some merit at
putting a few
drops of oil in the pistons prior to the first start up to ensure
lubrication.  Someone on the
list might be able to help on this subject.

Where are you located?  People from the list might be able to suggest a
good mechanic in
you area that might be able to help you out.

Hope this helps, if you have more questions, please let me know.
