 Hallo sharkfans

Just arrived after visiting Porsche in Zuffenhausen and IAA autoshow in =
Franfurt. After 10 hours driving my brother and me came to Porsche =
factory in Zuffenhausen. Meeting point was Porsche Museum where a lot of =
engines and road/race cars was showened. We was about 16 persons at the =
visit this day (open all days/hole year). There was two american couple =
which had ordred a new boxster and now picked it up at the factory. An =
young english spoken guy was our guide. He started telling us about =
Porsche history; 6000 employes - 4000 in production/admin and 2000 =
developing/racing/testing in Weissach. While he told the history, a lot =
of the new 911 (996) and Boxsters was leaving/arriving the factory. He =
told: All Porsche are tested at road conditions around Zuffenhausen =
(City/Autobahn driving for 1-2 hours). What a beatyful sound off the new =
watercooled flat 6-engine. First stop was engine assambling/testing. All =
parts to one engine came on a small robotvehicle to a person which =
assam. the engine. We were told that that Porsche are producing app. 150 =
cars a day, 35 911(both 993&996), 1-2 911Turbo's and rest Boxsters(986). =
A hole years Boxster production are less than only the amarican marked =
demands. Production can't be bigger in Zuffenhausen so they had started =
producing the Boxster in Finland. It's easy to start production in an =
another place, because Porsche are NOT producin ANY parts in their cars. =
That was NEWS. All parts in our loved Porsches are outsourced to other =
compagnies. Even all motor and body parts. They can't affort to cast =
motorparts or press body parts. Hole Bodyes comes and are only painted. =
Transmission comes fully assambled. Seats comes from Recaro fatory =
(Porsche choose/paints skins and sendt them to Recaro). Porsche made =
less than 20% in their cars (paint/add skin to doors/and assambling to a =
hole car). Back to motors. After being assamb. the engine is started and =
tested. After cooling down for 2 hours the engine is ready to be =
installed. then we went to the production line where the cars are =
assamb. All assambling of the hole car are hand made. Because of that =
you can choose among 700 body colors and more than 50 skin colors (you =
can even bring your own cow skin to the fatory - some had done that). =
After 2 hors visit we were back at the museum. Next to that their was a =
small "boutique" selling Porsche designed cloth and other stuff like =
that. Next to the factory, they sells used factory owened cars. They had =
about 20 used 928GTS from 95 runned from 10K miles - price from $ =
50,000.- (they looks totally new and hads 1 years fully garanti) All =
colours was present.=20

If you have any questions - write to me  =20
