Greg you wrote the following:

Also, all this talk about 1/4 mile times for the 928 is ok; and true, 
it's faster than most anything on the street; that is not it's forte. It 
is the compilation of the things it does well, and the competence in 
which it does them, that makes it a true supercar; and it's not hindered 
by things like 150mph speed-limiters, copycat engineering, and the likes, 
that keep cars like Supra Turbos, 300 ZX's, etc..... behind it, and 
even more so when the road opens up for stretches longer than 1/4 mile. 
(not to mention the fact that these cars are 10 years newer). We lead---- 
they follow, and the 928 doesn't have to prove a thing.



Eloquently stated... that says it for Del Lisk too!
