I purchased my 90 928 S4 in April of this year with 47 k on it.  it had
sat for almost the last two years, and it was leaking oil at the oil
pan, the front crank seal and the trans was leaking at the front trans
seal.  When I purchased the car I negotiated a 3 year 36k warranty which
covered seals and gaskets.  As soon as I bought the car I took it to a
shop to have all of the leaks fixed, and replace all of the belts and
hoses.  The timing belt has several spots on it where the teeth were
missing but they were very small sections or just a single tooth missing
here and there, the worst spot on the belt, out of about 12 -14 teeth
everyother one was missing.  The engine was in time and ran fin when we
took it apart.  I had the timing belt replaced and also replace the
leaking fron crank seal, and also the boot on the end of the tensioner,
(Hard as a brick.)  As it worked out, the warranty company paid the
brunt of the bill ($1400) & all I had to pay for was the timing belt,
the boot, andthe timing belt rollers, I wish I had know about the
waterpump longevity, I would have replaced it too!  Repairing the front
trans seal soon became a nightmare several weeks later, but that is
another story!
