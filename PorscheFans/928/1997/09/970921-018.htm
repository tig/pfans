Improvements can be made.

Sounds like that is the case. I had shift problems between 1 & 2 in my 3
speed. The transition from 1 to 2 took ages and the revs "hung in there",
then slowly dropped back as the plates engaged.

I dropped it into an auto transmission centre for a (limited budget)
tweaking. They replaced a few valves, adjusted some others and while not
perfect, it is performing far better than it did.
