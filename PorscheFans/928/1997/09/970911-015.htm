Rob,

You wrote,
"None of the interior lights work.  All worked prior to dis/re-assembly."

I had the same problem.  My car had been just painted before I bought It (a=
lmost a year ago now), and the interior lights didn't work when you opened =
either door, but did work when you'd open the hatch.  Anyway, the problem w=


ith mine turned out to be the little plunger switches in the door hinge are=
a.  I forget now if it was masking tape residue, or paint, on the plastic p=
lungers, but they were stuck "in".  I was able to clean one switch and get =
it to work, the other I just replaced, they're real cheap.  Anyway, you mig=
ht want to check this if you haven't already.

You also wrote,
"The "tail light" warning light comes on when the headlights are on..." etc=
..

I have this same problem also!  Haven't had a chance to get into that one y=
et though, too many other pressing things to fix first (doing ball joints r=
ight now).  Anyway, if you figure this one out, PLEASE let me know what you=
 did!  Anyone else BTDT?
