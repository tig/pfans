<<Brian Buxton is our resident auto detailer expert and maybe he can give us
some

of his "trade secrets" concerning this issue.>>

I am a resident auto detailer but I'm not an expert at much of anything
except having lots of opinions (all correct of course).     :-)
I was thinking of Richard's problem before I ever read your (David) referral
to me.  Thanks for the trust!

Richard,
I (honestly) have heard good things about using peanut butter to remove wax
from various unsightly places.  Just wipe on a little bit, let it sit for a
second and then wipe it off.  You really do need to try to get the wax off of
the wing before you use "Back to Black" or "Black Again" or any other type of
product like that.  And do also get all the peanut butter off, unless you
want to look like the Pied Piper of squirrels and various wild birds as you
drive around town.  Super Clean may work, but be very careful as I have seen
such products turn rubber hoses and trim in the engine compartment a chalky
white color.  Not to mention the fact that it isn't very paint friendly.  Try
the peanut butter, then throw on some pork chops, wait ... wrong recipe.
 Seriously though, try that and if that doesn't work put some Bug & Tar
remover on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it won't react badly with the
black (it shouldn't).  If these two don't work then I would have a few choice
words for whoever you had detail your car, some of which would be "are you
paying for my new spoiler with a check or cash?"  Let me know what happens.
