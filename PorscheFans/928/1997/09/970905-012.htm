Weeeeee!!

Brian, ain't nobody gettin' upset here! It's all fun.

> 928's aren't, and weren't ever meant to be stoplight racers.  

You are absolutely correct. I break rules.

And because they are such supercars, why _not_ have one that pops pimples
too?

Agreed. But I'm only changing the power-plant. All of its other qualities are
still intact.

>  Just like with a Rolex.  

[snip]

> Is a Rolex worth the price?  Absolutely.  

OK. Ya got me there 'cause it's beyond me why anyone would buy a Rolex. 
Well...maybe if I made over a Mil per year. ;-)

But it'll be so much fun CrUsHiNg their ego's in full witness of their
passengers!

Oh...you wouldn't eh? What kinda 0 to 60 are you turning? (I know, you can't
possibly answer that because it would be an admission that you know a spec
that's directly related to acceleration [ie. drag racing]  ;-)

> but b/c my Porsche is above that.  

Yes, they are. And I love to prove it.

> It has a mystique about it that I don't want to compromise by racing a
> Mustang on Green River Road in Evansville, IN- what an accomplishment!  

Well, that's a good point too, but kicking one's NSX ass on 2222 between 360
and Mopac in Austin, TX _is_ quite an accomplishment which can only be
enhanced with acceleration that rockets the car from one curve to the next.
(Look it up on http://www.mapquest.com/)

But it's already so close! Gotta go there.  

> Just wanted to start some more trouble.      :-)

You troublemaker you.

> Can I get an amen?!

Amen. Oops, mine was nugatory.
