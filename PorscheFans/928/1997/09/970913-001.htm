someone
overseas to get those little items we need for our Euro 928s. Can't seem to
find
anyone in US that will do it.  Maybe a Canadian Dealer can. (help us out Bob)

When I visited the factory's customer service center in February, they told
me they ship lots of parts overseas. Their computers are set-up to handle the
VAT correctly (you won't have to pay the 15% German VAT), and they speak
English,too!

Here are the numbers of the "Kundenzentrum", which includes the factory
repair shop, the "Exclusive" (body/interior customization) and "Tequipment"
(suspension/engine enhancement) departments:

                        Tel +49-711-911-7151
                        Fax +49-711-911-6095

If you have any problems getting parts through/from them, let me know - I
grew up with someone who is now their parts manager, and I could personally
kick his a... when I get there next time. But I'm convinced that won't be
necessary!

Good luck!
