Paul!

I love your train of thought!  Are you going with a fogger style nozzle
that very effciently mixes the nitrous and gas into a finely atomized
mix, or are you using seperate nozzles, one for nitrous and one for gas,
and letting the turbulence in the intake runners do the mixing?  Has the
person installing your system done them before, and/or taken the time to
do the math and design a SAFE system?  If you can afford it, use
throttle switches and timing relays, coupled with rpm sensors (min rpms
approx. 3000 and max..... for example).  I have heard horror stories of
people not shutting the system off in time (of engine melt down and over
reving) and ruining good engines because they were to caught up in the
"chase" and were not paying attention to the car.  

A timed system would use a main arming switch, a throttle switch to
activate the nitrous (at full throttle), and the electronics do the rest
of the timing, mixing, etc.  That way you can concentrate on driving
your pants off, and not risk hitting "the go way faster" button too
early and detonating your engine.

There are some good books on this subject.  I highly recommend you look
into some of them, if you haven't already, of course.

I would love to see your car when its done.  I'm in CT, not too far
away.

Disclaimer:  I have not installed a system.  I did spend a couple months
reading and designing a system to overcome a serious turbo lag problem
that was caused by installing a modified turbo on a Volvo.  The system
was designed for a short, three second boost, at 2500 rpm, triggered by
throttle switch, and deactivated by pressure switch which shut the
system off when a predetermined boost level was reached.  I sold the
Volvo to buy the 928, so I never install the system.
