That is, of course not what I told you. My exact quote was: "I have seen
too many rear bumper covers for sale from private parties at $400-450 to do
that. I don't have the time to update my contacts or run through the ads in
Excellence, Pano and PML for this little exercise."

>blah blah blah<

Since you've picked and chosen which of my points to blow off and which to
respond to, I guess I can do the same.

I think you've made your point here. My e-mail tells me you've probably
cost yourself several other customers beside myself. Have a nice day.
