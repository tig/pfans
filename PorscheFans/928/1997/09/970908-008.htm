It's true, the '84 does not have the ability to operate the windows
after the key is removed. Pity. Actually I never understood why the
operation of the windows should depend on the key at all, but that
must be a philosophical thing.

As to the problem, the left and right windows both get their power
from the same source, and are otherwise independent. Just a switch
and a motor for each side, nothing else. Could be that the motor
has some sort of overheat or overcurrent protection built in, which
would cause symptoms like yours.
