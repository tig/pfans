Response to the two issues in your post:

1.    It seems to me that you are overly stressed about journalism
opinion based on facts.  The idea in my first post was to point out that
the author of the offending article was stating opinion - and that we
all agree his opinion qualified as bovine defecation.  If I were to
state an unequivocal fact, like...."it's 70 degrees F in here".......you
might have the opinion it's cool, but I might have the opinion it's
warm.  Facts are absolute, but resulting opinions are subjective.  Your
point is well taken, but the real issue is that we generally disagree
with that author's opinion.  If you think about it, it would be a pretty
bleak media if only fact and data were reported.

2.    The issue of the hood being a stress component in unibody
construction.   Okay........I admit....in my journalistic overdrive to
express my idea, it was a mistake to include hood (or trunk lid) as
components necessary for stiffness.  However, this did get the curiosity
juices flowing and I'm contacting some folks in the car (manufacturing)
biz just to get a little more info about stiffness and unibody
construction.

..........now........hand over that post-it!    The bull's eye target
seems to fit my head!
