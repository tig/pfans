> I recently joined the mailing list and found it to be quite useful.
>
> I bought a 93 GTS in April of 95 from a Porsche dealer with 12k miles on it.
>
> It's previous owner was a Porsche area rep so I assume it was taken care of.
> I found the car to burn 1QT/480 miles after 6k miles of dealer monitoring of
> the oil
> consumption. Fortunately I bought a extended warranty and was able to have
> PCNA
> pay for a complete rebuild (new block,pistons,rings,bearings,valve
> seats,valve seals etc).
>
> I used conventional oil for the break in and after 5k miles switched to
> 5w-50 Mobil 1. It looks like the oil burning is not much better ~1Qt/500
> miles. I had the dealer change the oil after the first 2k miles and it
> appeared that the the burn rate was ~1QT/1000 miles (looking at the dip
> stick) then after the first oil change I was back to 1Qt/500 miles.
>
> I have talked to 4 other GTS owners, all who say they burn oil ranging from
> 1Qt/600 miles to
> 1Qt/3000 miles.
>
> The manual says  1 liter/1000km (1 qt/680 miles) as normal, and excessive as
> starting at 1.5
> liter/1000km.
>
> What are you other GTS owners seeing as rate of consumption, what kind of
> oil are you using,
> and what are your driving conditions (hot climate, hills, hi-RPM driving).
>
> Also, I timed the car from 20 to 100 MPH to see if the motor is healthy and
> it is. My times were
> about equal to the low times of the published data.

HelloBelieve it or not. I don't know how much is a quarter, but normal is 0.2-0.4
liter /1000 Km. The 1l/1000 is right but it should comes after 200-300 Tmiles. Make
a compression test and you can see if your engine is still ok. Even after
100000miles you can drive as fast as at 10000 miles and even with high oil
consumtion or an old engine.
