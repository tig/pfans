I have no experience with sperometer but I have a "handbook of Gear"
manual.  If VDO does not want to sell you the gear, you can try these
people a call at: (516) 328-3300 of fax (516) 326-8827.

They do have metric gears.  I would send them the dimension of the 
gear, its thickness and the number of teeth.

Good luck and I hope it hepls,
