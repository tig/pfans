If memory serves me well, the detector comes with the cable.  The
operating principle is very simple.  There is a wire going through
the plastic tip.  The pad runs thin and start wearing out the sensor
until the wire in it gets cut.  At this point, you have an
open circuit and an alarm is displayed.

The sensor are fairly cheap (less then $20).  If you do not wish to
replace them, you can take the sensor out and put a wire in the
connector to close the circuit and the warning light will go away.

Acording to the book, everything should be done by an authorized
dealer!!
I am sure someone on the list has done this maintenance before and
will provide you with some instruction.
