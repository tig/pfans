Today you wrote:

<Are you referring to the insides of the holes? Are these as effective at 
radiating heat as the flat surface?>

Surface area,  is after all,  surface area from a thermodynamic standpoint. 
  However, the insides of the holes do contribute equally with the surface 
of the rotor due to the pumping action of the interior vanes as well the 
passing of the pad over them.  These two items allow for airflow over these 
surfaces, therein the exchange of heat.  If you look at interior of Rotors 
as manufactured by AP for Large sports cars which cannot use Carbon rotors 
(due to rules) you will see that in addition to having holes and vanes on 
the interior, they also have "stalactites"  intruding into the airspace 
between the vanes from each interior rotor half.  This is done to increase 
surface area for heat exchange.  The actual increase in surface area with 
this design is approximately 45%.  This rotors have shown a significant 
decrease in cooling cycle times and much improved pad wear in long distance 
events.
Hope this answered your questions.
P.S.  I guess it is a good thing that we do not have aluminum windscreens, 
from the previous posts,  all  928's would by now have completely lost all 
structure and the resale value would set new records for deprecation. 
  Christ, the IRS would have to establish entirely new rules to deal with 
the phenomena. Maybe Allan Greenspan would become involved and blame it all 
on the Bundusbank (sic) as a grave plot to ruin the US economy and send 
inflation wild. Interest rates will climb, the end of world as we know it 
is would be upon us.  ET AL.

Enjoy your ride,
