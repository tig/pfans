Before I get started on alignments, if it's a pleasure only car (and you
don't mind not driving in pouring rain), you'll have more fun driving/$
with BFG R1's on your 16's than on 17's with street tires.

Factory toe and -1.1 degree camber up front and -45' in back looks like
I'm gonna get maybe 10,000 miles out of these tires!  (That's good for
R1's - I've got the KC springs and Konis.)

No fine tuning things - when adjusting rear camber for example it
affects rear toe.  Therefore set the camber and then the toe.  Then
you're done.

We don't need no stinkin' 'lingment racks!  What you do need is a
digital level, 2 lasers, possibly some Aluminum plate, a bunch of
electrical cable ties, and a reasonably flat (but not level) work
surface (see corner balancing write-up for "flat" -
http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kgibble/bmw/corner_balancing.html )  You can
probably get all this for the price of one alignment plus then you've
got to do the work.  Of course, the 2nd time, you just have to do the
work and the rest is free.

For all measurements you need a good flat working surface on the wheel.=20
The dish wheels are good if you remove the center caps and they haven't
been dinged around there.  Otherwise, cable tie a piece of 1/4" thick
Aluminum to the wheel to get a work surface roughly parallel to the
plane of rotation of the wheel.

(I think you do caster first but I haven't done it so I'll save that for
last - it's the least critical.)

Camber:
Data collection:
1. Park the car on the working surface and mark the position of each
wheel with chalk.
2. Measure the angle of each wheel from vertical using the digital
level.  The level I used didn't read precisely around 90=B0 so I dialed i=
n
an offset (it could do that).  I dial in an offset of about 5=B0 so that =
I
don't have to keep track of positive and negative angles which can be
confusing.
3. Move the car forward by =BD wheel rotation.  Measure the angles of all
4 wheels again being sure to reverse the direction of the level this
time.  If you have a good surface on the wheels (dish wheels), then you
don't have to move the car forward and can just measure the angle with
the level both ways the first time.  This step removes any errors due to
an offset in the level and a tilt in the Al plate or it's mounting.
4. Turn the car around and park at the same place on the working
surface.  By doing this, we cancel the effect of the slope of the
surface (and we also measure it which will be a consistency check).
5. Repeat 2 and 3.
Data analysis:
1. Take the average of the angles measured in steps 2 & 3 (watch for
negative angles) for each wheel.
2. Take the average of the angles measured in step 5 for each wheel.
3. Calculate half of the difference of the measurements of the previous
2 steps.  This is the angle of your working surface (left to right).=20
The extent to which the numbers for all 4 wheels are the same is a good
estimate of the accuracy of the measurements.
4. Instead of taking half the difference, calculate the average of the
above for each wheel.  This is the camber of that wheel.
Toe:
1. Mount a laser to each of the front wheels with the wheels pointed
straight ahead.  The laser can be one of the laser diode pointers or a
He-Ne.  Please use a class II visible laser and don't shine it in your
eye (or those of the people across the street) - no Class IV 20W argon
ion's please.  For example, you can cable tie the laser to the aluminum
plate.  Those with the dish wheels can possibly get by by having an
assistant hold the laser against the wheel surface.
2. Pace off about 25 feet in front of the wheels and measure the
distance between the 2 laser beams.  It's good not to do this at high
noon as the laser beam will be hard to see in sunlight but it can easily
be done with the help of a little shade.
3. Roll the car back half a wheel rotation and pace off 25 feet back
from the front axle.  Measure the distance between the 2 laser beams.=20
Again the people with pristine dish wheels can just turn the laser
around if they're having an assistant hold it - I prefer checking that
rolling the car has no effect on this.
4. Total toe angle in degrees is then 180 [d(back)-d(front)]
/(25=B42=B412=B4p)  where d is in inches.
5. For rear toe, you have to be sure both wheels are basically pointing
forward so the car doesn't dog.  A long straight edge can be helpful
here I'm told.
Caster:
Here you measure the camber for the front wheels turned at full lock
left and then full right.  You must account for the fore/aft slope of
your surface again by reversing the car.  Measure the steering angles of
the front wheels at lock and plug through the numbers.  I haven't done
this yet so no strong claims on this one.

For the toe, you can easily read good to =BC" front to back leading to a
1.5 minute error which ain't bad (assuming your tie rods and such are up
to this).  For the camber, the consistency of the slope of the surface
is typically =B15 minutes.  We sampled 4 928's that were recently
"professionally" aligned.  Mine turned out to match the print out
(commissioned by PO) whereas the others were all significantly off - one
by more than 1=B0 in camber difference left to right and all the others
were off by considerably more than our =B15' precision.  Remember to have
the suspension settled for all of this, especially for the final front
toe measurements (as far as I can tell, rear toe doesn't change with
height, front camber increases significantly when lowering and the rear
camber increases a bit).Hope that helps.

Seems I got Mark DaVia convinced of going - we're there - 14 hours of
driving and then an auto-x on Sunday back here.
