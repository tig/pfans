I lucked out.  The ball joints failed soon after I drove into my
driveway.  Imagine the situation when you're out on the freeway.  I
would not drive the car until the joints are replaced!  I did the joints
only.  You can salvage the old eccentrics if they're in good shape.
Mark the outline of the old joints before removing.  Install new ones
and get an alignment asap.  One hour job.  It is also a good time to
inspect your tie rods.
