I wrote a couple of days ago about my first autocross.  I really enjoyed
it and plan on continueing.
Being a first timer I have some questions.  I hope some of you more
expierance racers can help me.
What setup does Kim Crumb use?(rim width, tires, tire pressure, swaybar,
springs, shocks, alignment, etc)  I know its not the same for
autocrossing and timetrials or even for different tracks but a average
set would be more than close enough for me
I assume that wider tires are better and becouse of the 50/50 weight
distribution I should run the same size front and rear I was going to
use 245/45/16 on 8"x16" rims.
For autocrossing I need to be able to downshift my automatic trans from
second back down to first gear for the really tight corners. I read
about the modification of adding the momentary push button switch
connected to the throttle kickdown button but will that downshift from
second to first?

PS  I still need some rims 8"x16" (I think, based on recomendations from
info I hope to get)
