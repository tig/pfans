Can anything go out of adjustment with an automatic transmission?
	
My recent purchase of an 84 928S (US spec) with an automatic trans 
seems to have some unusual behavior with the way it behaves under
certain load-ranges and certain RPM's.  Driving the car under "normal"
conditions and temperment, the transmission seems mushy, or soft below
about 2200 rpm.  I don't believe it's slipping, but the acceleration
seems somewhat attenuated.  Above about 2200 rpm, the character of the
drive-trains' responsiveness changes to much more aggresive - less
"slippy".  If I jump on it from stopped to slow speed, the Tach jumps
up to about 2500, seems to hang there for a moment and then begins its
normal clime.

The problem is that without another 928 to test as a comparison, it is
difficult to know if this is normal or if improvements can be made.
Can a torque-converter wear out?  
What could be done to make the transmission more efficient in transfer
of engine touque to the pavement?
Is the ol' girl needin a little therapy at the tranny-spa?
