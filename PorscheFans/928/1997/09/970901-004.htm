I am in Massachusetts, and have a friend who is in the auto business and
works exclusively with 928s (known firms such as 928 International buy
transmissions from him for $1,500 each and mark them up to $2,300, and even
Devek bought some parts from him a few weeks ago). He has 20-30 parts cars,
an excellent body guy that works with him, an associated frame shop, and a
928 mechanic who blows away all the rest. He frequently gets in totalled
S4s for 3-6k and makes them beautiful and straight, and sells them for
11-15k. Occasionally, for a friend, they give a 928 "the treatment". When
my car was sideswiped, and took the insurance cash, and another 2-3k of my
own, and told them I wanted the "the full treatment".

The car was side swiped, so they had to replace the front fender, replace
the door, and fix the rear quarter panel with lead filler. They then sand
blasted the entire car to remove the paint, and painted it yellow, cleared,
wet sanded, and cleared it, then wet sanded, buffed it, and so on. They
also took off the "S" rear spoiler and moved the Strosek spoiler down a
little.

Then they stripped the whole interior, carpets, seats, quarter panels,
dash, pod, headliner, and replaced it with a two-tone black/mustard-yellow
one out of a mint 91' car.

Then they put an entire suspension of a 91' car and installed new Konis and
Weltmeister springs and the mechanic fitted red GTS brakes and rotors .

Then there were some repairs to the engine and the installation of the
Devek headers, and I think that's all they did (besides the cool engine
painting I already talked about).

I spent about $14k on the car total on this makeover, if I was to go to
some other shop and pay current market prices for the labor and parts, I
would have been looking at $20-23k.
