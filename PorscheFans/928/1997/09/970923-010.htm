Couple of notes:

Caution must be advised when thinking about synthetic 5W40 and 5W50s.
Here significant amounts of the thickeners used to make petroleum
multigrades must be used so that the high-shear viscosity will provide
the equivalent to a petroleum SAE 40.

The superiority of synthetics lies in the fact that a 10W40 synthetic
can provide the high-shear protection superior to a petroleum 20W50 in
the bearings and cams, while providing a much lower viscosity on the
cylinder walls and in the ring pack. This lower viscosity produces more
power and also better efficiency and fuel economy. However, wide range
synthetics such as 5W50s use the same thickener systems as petroleum
20W50s and suffer from the same viscosity losses in the bearings and
cams. 

You're better off running the weight the factory recommends (20W50, or
you can go down to 10W40 if you're using Red Line, since it's able to
provide better than 20W50 protection in the bearings and cams).  Red
Line's 10W40 will give you a pour point of better than -40F (-40C)
anyway!  What's the downside of what you're doing?  You're going to need
an engine rebuild much sooner....

Another note:  I've heard from several sources that Castrol Syntec will
leave deposits in various places in your engine.  Petroleum oils will do
the same, but the better synthetics will leave virtually no deposits (0%
with Red Line).
