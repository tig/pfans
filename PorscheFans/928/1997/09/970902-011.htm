I am new to the list, but not the archives.  I have studied all postings and
felt I had to do it. ( the fact that i was at Road America a couple of weeks
ago didnt help)  I purchased my Burgundy 86 928 S  5spd a week ago.  The
condition it was in and the price were right (13k  77k miles  mint body , new
tires new AC, new clutch)
it was a 2 owner car.  I was a very proud owner and just getting over the
guilt of my purchase i couldnt afford, i was rear ended at about 30mph by a
chrysler lebaron covert. The porsche won.  The hood was folded in half  on
the chrysler and pissing everything.  928 had grill marks in rear plastic,
damaged bumperette, exh sys. pushed forward and bent real good.  Estmator at
local fine restorer is about 6k( i trust this guy. he was in process of
restoration on lambo miura. lots of nice porsches there too).
Anybody on this list from Chicago, Tulsa, or Albuqurque. Can any of you
recommend body shops in these areas?
