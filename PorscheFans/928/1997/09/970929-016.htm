A little too much free-association, Leonard!  Tried to save some
electrons (okay, I WAS LAZY) typing....

Interesting thing is that although there's lots of Ducatis here in
Portland, there's no Portland Ducati dealer...you have to go 45 minutes
south to Salem (fraction of the size of Portland).

Actually, there IS officially a Ducati dealer here...but I called them
up in Feb. just after the Seattle Bike Show, asked them if they were
getting any 748s in, and the guy said, "What's a 748?".....at which
point I said thanks and hung up.

Enough non-shark content, though....nobody have any ideas on my
frequent-non-starting problem?
