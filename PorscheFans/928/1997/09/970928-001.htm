Well, it happened, and it was a wonder.

How much time passes for any of you between 928 sightings? Now contemplate
a steady stream of 928 cars (eventually numbering about 50) pulling into a
driveway and being arranged around all of a long, crescent-shaped parking
lot, then later arranged in rows for a group shot.

How often do you meet someone who knows what a 928 is, let alone owns one?
Now contemplate spending a sunny day hanging around with dozens of highly
motivated owners, ogling cars (from above and below, with a '78, '86, '89,
and '93 up on racks), talking shop (long seminars and Q&A sessions under
and around the cars with Kim, Ed, and others with info to share), and
scheming for the future of the model (yes, I know my tenses; more below).

How often do you hear 928s characterized as overweight tourers or "what the
doctor buys his wife"? Now contemplate spending the day up close and
personal with race hero Kim Crumb, several PCA instructors, and numerous
PCA "driving students" and autocrossers, all of whom do it in 928s, not to
mention Kim's collection of in-car race videos (see the full-race 930
disappear to the rear of a 1985 928 S with stock brakes!)

How many times have you been told that the 928 is a discontinued model, not
a true Porsche, an aluminum time-bomb, and other discouraging nonsense? Now
contemplate dozens of enthusiastic owners who found it irresistibly
attractive to jump into their 928s and drive five, nine, even thirteen
hours to attend this meeting (or express their longing to do from
Kalamazoo, Tucson, and Sydney), share their knowledge and enthusiasm, and
scheme actively about organizing to preserve and advance the 928 and
consolidate the power of tens of thousands of 928 owners, most of whom have
been living without the invigorating community that this list has indicated
and that events like the Frenzy and the comparable West Coast event earlier
this year have nucleated.

As Phil Tong and crew have discovered, there are MANY 928 owners who care
most vigorously and passionately about their cars and intend to keep them
going indefinitely. We need to pull together to form the kind of
organization that does the best job of concentrating available information
and owner interest (not to mention numbers), not only for our own benefit
for but for the information (and possible surprise) of the automotive
aftermarket, the competition authorities, PCA, and others who are
interested in the world of high performance cars and their owners and
maintainers.

There will be more forthcoming on this subject, but all thoughts,
suggestions, volunteer offers, and expressions of interest are welcome here
right now. As Kim Crumb so thoughtfully reminded us, the future of the 928
is in our hands.

Meanwhile, huge recognition is due Ed Ruiz for organizing this event, his
crew of PCA Potomac Region volunteers for making it happen, ASG and its
owners for providing a huge, clean, well-equipped space in which to play
with and talk about our cars, and vendors including Devek for appearing
with goodies and support.

There will be more facts, figures, and images forthcoming on this subject
as well, so stay tuned.
