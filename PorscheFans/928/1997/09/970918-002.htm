Replaced the pads and rotors all around, was very simple. Just followed
the instructions in the manuals. Just about anyone could do this, save
some $$ and get to know your car better. Stayed with the stock rotors
and pads, will consider an upgrade next time.

Still need to get the cruise control working and to find a cross-drilled
and vented aluminum windshield with the antenna built in.

There has been a lot of tire talk, what are people using and what are
the prices.

86 928S 5spd.

PS I'm looking for advice as to what enhancements can be easily made to
an '86 928S.
I've heard about various chips, but don't know if that is the best place
to start.
