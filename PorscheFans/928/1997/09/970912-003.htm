Hi porshefans,
I really enjoy this digest.  I have a "91 GT and I have 64K miles and I have
only put in 2000 miles since I bought the car in 1/97.  I know that the car
has been maintained by the dealer and has had the 60K scheduled maintenance.
 The car has been rattling/grinding when the clutch is fully depressed,
otherwise the shifting is normal.  Could this be the throw out bearing being
worn or is the clutch about to go out?  How do I know it is time for a new
clutch?  If I should replace should I stay with OEM or is there a better
clutch out there?

Has anyone had experience with replacing their clutch in the S4 or the GT and
is this something that I can do or just let the dealer take care of?
