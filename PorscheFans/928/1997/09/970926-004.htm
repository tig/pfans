Vic, You have plenty of company.  Several years ago I pulled up to a =
traffic signal in Boca Raton in my beautiful triple black Ferrari 328.  =
I had a georgeous creature with me who was terribly impressed with the =
car as she had never been in a Ferrari before. A guy in a 911 pulled up =
on my right in the curb lane and while we were waiting for the light to =
change we engaged in a revving contest.  On green, we both floored it =
and were running neck and neck when we were both suddenly blown into the =
weeds by a gang of high school kids in a Buick that sounded like it had =
an Allison engine in it, although it was hard to tell because the eleven =
million watts of amplification they had pumping out acid rock was doing =
permanent brain damage to everyone within several hundred yards.=20

After I stopped laughing I got rid of the Ferrari and went back to 928s =
like the good lord meant me to.

Another subject: Insurance.  Maybe some of you guys should check out =
GEICO if they operate in your state.  I have full coverage on my 87S4 =
including collision, comprehensive, glass damage, acts of war, uninsured =
motorist, and tsunami damage.  I pay 840.00 per year with no mileage =
limitations.

Driving the old turkey to Connecticut today.  Gotta get some sailing in =
before the weather in New England turns ugly. Still too hot down here =
for human habitation. Talk to you guys in a few weeks.

Gene O'Rourke
