Are you sure that your switch is not dirty and with some persuasion, it
would work all the
time?  If this is not the case, you will have to take  a very close look
at the electrical circuit.
Our car is design with a built in function that enables the windows and
sunroof to be
closed after the key is removed and the door has not been open (this
only for a limited
time (?)).

The relay involved in this process might be the guilty component, but it
is just a wild guess.
