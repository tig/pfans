  Over the weekend, I found a similar connector, although in a different
  location.  Mine was mounted on the driver's side fender just in front 
  of the power steering pump.  The wire to the connector was wrapped in 
  the same plastic tie wrap that held the wires coming from the two 
  large resistors mounted on the fender.  Sounds like it could be the 
  same type of wire that Andy saw on his '83 Euro.  Would some other 16v 
  owners (either K or L-Jetronic) check to see if they have a similar 
  connectionless connector?
  
  TIA.
