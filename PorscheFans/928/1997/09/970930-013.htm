Try this out in a red '88 911 and then with an '85 faded yellow VW
Vanagon!  The difference is simply amazing.  Since I got my 911, it
feels like I'm risking my life in my van because everyone is so
determined to swerve around it and cut it off. Simply doesn't happen
in the other car.  I do have my share of tricked out Integra GS-R's
trying to race me in the 911 though.  I laugh them off (especially
since a few could probably beat me :), and they get REALLY angry.
What is with these guys? Insecurity?
