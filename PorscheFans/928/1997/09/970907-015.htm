Sounds like the oil driained out of your head (cylinder that is ) and
caused your lifter
to get noisy.  This will also happen when doing an oil change and not
putting oil in the
filter.  My mechanic advises to bump the car a few time after an oi
change before letting
the engine start.  It allows the oil pump to get the oil circulating
before the engine is started.
However, in my case, the engine starts right away and does not allow
bumping.  Who said
that an engine that started on the first turn of the crank was aalways a
good thing?? ;-)
