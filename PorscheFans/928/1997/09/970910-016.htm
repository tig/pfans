I am taking a guess here but I think that Porsche went to such
details explaining the difference because the old belt  is 
incompatible with the new sprocket and vice versa.  With the big
warning, no mechanic should make this mistake and thus preventing
bad publicity.



As for why they change the thooth profile, I cannot even take a
guess (only 1 guess per answer allowed as a self imposed rule ;-)
