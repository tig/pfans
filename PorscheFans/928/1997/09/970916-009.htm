But 928 International is a full-fledged, full-time business, and I expect
high quality, full recourse, etc. in dealing with a business. You are doing
this as a hobby, right?

I have done the conversion... correctly, the way the Factory does--bolting,
not taping the rear cover, clearing the taillight area, not jamming it
together. You do it your way, Ill do it Porsche's.

...which do not clear the inner panels on early cars.

There's a reason the (idiots at the) Factory didn't use tape to attach this
part. I'll go with their decision, thanks.

You're cutting a lot of corners here. Why?

Fine, but you didn't clarify that.

I guess you left out some information.

Aparently you have difficulty accepting the way the Factory does things.
Personally, I prefer to do it their way. You are reacting to my post as if
it were a personal attack, which is pretty silly. You makde a public
statement; I responded to it publicly. If you can't accept another opinion,
you may want to avoid endless re-posting of your inventory in future.

Contrary to your implication, I have done the conversion, and it is
apparent that your standards are quite different from mine. Both the front
turn signal assemblies and the taillight assemblies require clearancing.
There is no rear mount for the S4 front spoiler, and one must be
fabricated--unless you choose to just let it hang. You have to change the
final muffler or modify inlet/outlet to match the different tailpipe
position. Since the Factory chooses to bolt up the covers, that is my
choice as well.

My post was for the benefit of anyone contemplating the changeover. I'm
sorry if you feel it is not conducive to peddling your parts. I have no
idea why you find it such an emotional issue. But its my opinion, and
everyone has a right to it :-)
