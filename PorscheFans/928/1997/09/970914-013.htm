Alan:

Oil pressure is one of those wonderful things that seems to change on a
whim.  But there are a few things to think about, so here goes..

If all that the dealer or technician did is change the oil,  your "problem"
is most likely the oil itself.  Reading the owner's manual for the first
time on Friday,  I noted that there is a pretty large range of acceptable
oil viscosities suitable for use in my car.  Going by the chart, I see that
I can use 10W-40, 20W-50, 5W-40, 5W-50...

Depending on who (and how) you listen to when oil viscosity ratings are
discussed,  you'll probably conclude that the first number is the "winter"
viscosity.  This is a standard number based on flowability at low temps,
specifically at 0degf.  The second number relates to viscosity and film
strength at higher temps, 212degf if my  halfhiemers-impaired memory serves
me.  (visit www.mobil.com for a clinic on oil ratings...)

So how does this affect you?  Say for instance that your car had 5W-50 or
20W-50 in it before.  With the heavy oil (50 rating), after the engine is
warm the idle oil pressure would be high.  Your technician installed 10W-30
this time.  The thinner oil flows a little easier now, thanks to the lower
viscosity.  That also means the pump isn't working so hard and the pressure
is lower.

Think about how the engine is lubricated, and simplify it down to a pump
that's forcing oil through a hole with a known diameter.  The pump is a
positive displacement type, so at any given speed it's trying to pump the
same volume of oil without regard to discharge pressure.  The "hole" is
actually a lot of smaller "holes" like bearings and nozzles.  The thicker
oil doesn't flow so easily through the hole, so more pressure is required.

So what's the ideal oil pressure?  The lowest necessary to maintain oil flow
to all the required lubrication points.  The lowest required to maintain
sufficient flow to keep critical parts cool.  High enough to keep the gauge
up where the driver doesn't panic, and also to avoid having the driver
dismiss low readings as 'normal' when he or she shouldn't.


So, what should you do...

The first thing is of course a look to see what oil was installed.  Compare
to your last service order, and see what changed.  I can speculate that your
technician may have put in a lighter oil in anticipation of winter
conditions.  You may have decided to change to a "fuel-efficient" oil like
5W-30 or even one of the new Mobil-1 "0W-xx" formulations.  A change from a
more conventional 'dino' oil to a synthetic may cause the symptom you describe.


The important point to remember in any troubleshooting exercise is to go
back first to things that you know have changed.  This one is a pretty
simple case where we know what changed because we caused it-- the oil and
the filter.

Oh, and the filter...

A partially plugged filter might cause the symptom you describe.  In my
limited experience,  new filters aren't partially plugged.

Good Luck!,  and let us know what you discover, please.


Regards,

dr bob
