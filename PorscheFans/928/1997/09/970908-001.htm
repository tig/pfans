Purpose of event: To discuss various aspects of the 928. Kim Crumb will be
our main guest speaker. Marc and Susan from "Devek Performance" as well and
Lucky Ekman (the EK in Devek) will be there. There will be door prizes
compliments of "928 International" and "Devek
Performance". A highly modified 928GTS may be available for our viewing and
listening pleasure. 928 related parts, shirts, and literature will be on
sale at PCA discounted
prices. Lastly, there will be a short discussion on the viability of forming
a "928
club" that would augment our PCA membership.

directions to "ASG" will be sent to respondents. I will need the completed

9/20/97.

Hope to see you there and happy motoring. Ed Ruiz (86'928S)

P.S. If you are planning to attend and have not yet sent in the registration
form, I need to have it and a check prior to Sept. 20, 1997 so that I will
have a good head count for food and event planning. The event currently has
35 registered participants. You'll be sorry if you miss this event.
