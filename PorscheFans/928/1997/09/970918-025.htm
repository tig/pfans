Here's a relevant passage from the book _Turbochargers_ by Hugh MacInnes
(HPBooks, 1984; ISBN 0-89586-135-6).  Even if you're not interested in any
kind of supercharging (why not?  Factory schmactory, I say), it's a pretty
useful book on engines.

Exhaust Wrapping
	Doug [Roe] suggests wrapping the exhaust pipe with insulating material to
keep from losing any heat in the exhaust system.  This also lowers the
temperature of the engine compartment.
	Exhaust wrapping is standard practice for racing, where fractions of a
second mean the difference between winning or losing.  On street
applications, the installation may cause more trouble than it cures.
	George Spears suggests: "In regard to the subject of wrapping the
exhaust-to-turbine pipe, we experimented on the V6 Capri and the V6 Mustang
and found very little or no gain.
	"What we found was a tremendous deterioration of the wrapped pipe.  It
rapidly oxidizes.  In some cases, we found the bends distort and the
crossover pipe warps.  Once removed, the exhaust system cannot be reinstalled.
	"For most automotive applications, wrapping is unnecessary, costly,
seriously affects exhaust-pipe life, and generally is not attractive."
	In both cases, George was referring to a V6 engine.  On any V-type or
opposed engine the crossover pipe takes the most punishment.
	The engine itself is water-cooled and will not get much over 220F.
Therefore, the distance between the exhaust ports on the two banks will not
vary much.  But the crossover pipe connecting the ports may reach a
temperature as high as 1500F.
	At this temperature, it will grow about 1/3 inch more than the block if
the pipe is made from 300-series stainless steel.  With this much growth
something has to give.  Because the engine block is usually far stronger
than the crossover pipe, the pipe will give.
	When Rajay first produced their Volkswagen Turbocharger Kit, the pipe from
the exhaust ports to the turbine inlet was wrapped with an efficient heat
blanket.  A few months later, one of these pipes was returned as being
defective.  Several pieces had flaked out of the corners nearest the
exhaust ports.
	This was thought to be a bad piece of tubing until several more headedrs
were returned with the same problem.  The kit was redesigned and the header
was chrome-platd rather than insulated.  There was no appreciable
performance difference between the two types and the chrome-plated headers
had a much better appearance and life.
	Don Hubbard says, "Some people say the turbo is operated by the exhaust
*heat* of the engine.  they are tempted to insulate the exhaust tubes
between the engine and the turbo to get more heat to the turbo.  This
usually causes overheating of the exhaust tubing and premature failure.
	"Exhaust gases actually have a velocity and pressure along with the heat
that drives the turbo.  Usually, the insulation used around the exhaust
system is to keep radiant heat off other engine parts.
	"In some Indy cars, insulation has been used to keep the high-speed air
stream from cooling the tubes excessively because the state of tune of the
engine requires every little bit from the turbo for response and power and
the balance is critical."
