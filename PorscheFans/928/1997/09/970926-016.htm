>Marc - A couple of questions:

>>>A) 4) R1's on 8x16 Epsilons (25 rear/28 front for 15-20 min. TT, 32 
>>>rear/28 front for AX). 
>
>That's quite a bit less than BFG's standard recommendation. Any problems

(BTW, I meant to say "28 rear/32 front for AX")
No, not really, they seem to be wearing OK, with the outsides getting the 
wear, it seems.
>
>>>F) Removed/bypassed rear brake pressure regulators--made very noticeable 
>>>difference,

>Just a comment: apparently you can get a 55 bar regulator. No problem with
>rears locking up?

I completely removed the regulators.  In fact, I need even more rear 
bias(!).
>
>>>G) Adjustable spring perches all four corners--lowered car 
>>>3"/corner-weighted.
>
>Wow! 3 inches - do you ever drive it on the street? How?

Yep. Whack anything, and everything--even my front tires rub when I turn 
on eneven surfaces.  In fact , when I back out of my driveway, it 
actually grinds a bit everytime.  It's really kinda funny, I've just 
gotten use to hitting the two (severly scraped, and bent) "tow" hook 
attachments.  But they are easily replaced, and have had several years of 
bashing already (I call them my "bash plates.").  The only thing I used 
to have real problems with was when I had the long-tube headers on and 
they would always drag on speed bumps.
>
>>>J) Installed ten(!) spring spacers (3/each front, 2/each rear) in the 
>>>Weltmeister springs--this effectively increased the spring rate to over 
>>>1000lb/in F, 500lb/in R--(HUGE difference in handling!  LOVE IT!) 
>>>Recommended, if you have a reasonable flat (not bumpy) track surface.

Actually I wish I could find the rubber ones.  I've just been using the 
"spring boosters" as found in the nationwide chains.  They are the 
"expandable" type; there is a threaded wedge that drives two other 
"bushing halves" that expand to meet the turns of the spring.  What's 
nice about these, is you can also corner-weight the car w/o the 
adjustable spring perches. Those are for the front.  For the rear, I used 
another type that has the two bolts, because the rear springs are longer. 
 Minutes to install/adjust/remove.
