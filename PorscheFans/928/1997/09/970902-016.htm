Last Friday I posted a message describing a problem I had with my 88
automatic; for no apparent reason, the engine simply wouldn't turn over.
My battery had enough juice to run the windows, seats, etc. but not the
engine.  I received a lot of good advice from Dave Cooley, Leonard Laub,
and Joe Farhat but Leonard gets the brass ring; he advised me to look at
the obvious things first and, after removing the carpet and spare tire,
and checking my battery cels, I found them dry as a bone. After filling
them up and getting a jump start (I never knew you could do it under the
hood as opposed to the battery) the engine's been starting with ease.
Thanks for all the help. Mike
