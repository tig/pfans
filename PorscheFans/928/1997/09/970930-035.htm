Hi Brian:

Yes, the Momo Anatomic in the Automotion catalogue is of the same kind that
I used.  The procedure is actually fairly simple:  Once you get the
t-handle off, you'll see a rod that is actuated by a small roller which
sits in the top of the auto-lever.  In order to shift gears without the
t-handle, you must push down on the roller, and that in turn pushes the rod
which actuates the lockout.  Thus, the job must first start with a pushing
down on the roller, and a permanent pre-loading of the rod tension.  In
order to pre-load the roller, you have two choices;  you can either stick a
wad of something into the lever and on top of the roller [I think even duct
tape would probably work], or you can drill the roller and the lever and
then safety-wire it.  The Momo knob then simply goes on over top of this
safety-wired arrangement, and is tightened down with a small bolt.  I
drilled and safety-wired my setup, as I'm never going to go back to the old
system.
Stephane mentioned the carbon-fibre shift-knob;  I looked at it briefly,
and it looks like the same knob, but the black leather knob really suits
the black leather interior - if you didn't know better, you'd think that
was the way the car originally came.  If your interior isn't black, I'm
sure Momo makes them in a bunch of different colors, so there's probably a
leather that will match.  These knobs are not exclusive to Automotion, and
if you look around, I think you can get them pretty reasonably.  I hope
that helps out;  let me know if I've missed relating a step.

Regards,
Dave Jorgensen
