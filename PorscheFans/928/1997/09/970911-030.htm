A couple of people are looking for cushions.   Does anybody have a
couple of black leather rear seatbacks?   The cushions and bottoms are
fine, but years of sun dried out the leather beyond repair for the
backs.   I know there are kits, but kinda expensive.

I'm foaming and fuming at not being able to participate in the frenzy.
If my ride were ready, I'd be part of the caravan!   Oh
well..........maybe the next one?

Note for Adamant King:   back atcha on the compliment.   I deserved to
be called on my opinions.   Will pass on to the list any info I can
squeeze out of Detroit regarding unibody construction.
