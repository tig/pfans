Hello,

I'm looking at purchasing a 1980 928 with aprox. 45k miles. As this would 
be my first Porsche I would like to hear about what to look for in this 
car.

1. problems, recalls etc.

2. I've only looked at it briefly but I'm told it has an electrical 
problem where the alternator gauge jumps about erratically. Someone tried 
to look at it and the passenger window does work now. 

How is the electrical on this car? I'm good with electrons but some 
cars/models are just lemons when it comes to wiring, hopefully this is 
not the case with this car. 

3. Automatic transmission? Plus/Minus? Problems?

4. Any ideas on a fair price. 45k, black in and out. Couple of small 
dings to the galvanized. Good tires. Air works, black paint has a bit of 
white spotting in a small area on one side. A little fogging in the rear 
side windows. The curved ones. (Does this happen to all of them?)

5. Expected mileage from this car with a well running engine and AT. (For 
comparison sake)


Any comments and insights welcome. If possible please CC me directly at: 
djtowle@meer.net 

Thanks in advance.
