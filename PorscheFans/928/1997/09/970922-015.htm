Re: the comments made by Mark DaVia, David Roberts, and James Morrison =
on my message to Kurt Gibbel on doing whell alignments at home.  James, =
the last thing I would do would be to discourage anyone from working on =
their cars themselves.  Did it myself for a long time on just about =
every kind of sportscar you can think of.  However, all three of you =
seem to be under the impression that wheel alignment on a 928 is a =
mystical thing.  I'm on my seventh one and have driven them jointly over =
three hundred thousand miles since 78. =20

During that time I've probably had six or seven alignment jobs done on =
the six earlier ones and just had a two wheel alignment done on my 87 =
this past Friday, as I had hit a major pothole and threw the alignment =
off just enough to finish off my front tires.  This was the third =
alignment I had done on this particular car because I've put over 80K on =
it in the past eight years.  (87 S4 5sp).  The alignment cost $39.00.  A =
four wheel alignment would have been $59.00.=20

Maybe, because I was involved in the so-called exotic car business for a =
few years here in South Florida, I learned through trial and error, who =
the good mechanics and tire and alignment places were.  The most I ever =
paid for a four wheel alignment was $89.00 at a Parnelli Jones franchise =
in Santa Cruz, Calif. and they destroyed my steering rack in the =
process.  With that single exception I've never had any problems with =
people messing up alignment jobs.

Oh, and one other thing.  I've seen guys take several hours to do 928 =
alignments and I've also watched others do them in a half hour or less.  =
The fact that 928s are hardly ubiquitous in most places obviously adds =
to the confusion, as many people just have'nt worked on them before and =
have to flounder around for a while in the process.

But please don't mistake my intent.  After reading Kurt Gibbel's =
somewhat protracted instructions, on how to perform this wondrous and =
mystical task at home, I was merely attempting  to add a note of levity =
to the proceedings.

The mere fact that I have had as many 928s and driven them that many =
miles surely tells what I think of them.  However, they're still cars =
and I think that sometimes people tend to imbue them with a mystery they =
don't deserve. Hope I did'nt offend anyone.
