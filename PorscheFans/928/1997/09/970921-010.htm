Richard,
I don't have the answer to the age old window trim question that has plagued all
auto enthusiasts since the addition of windows in automobiles.
However I do have a few suggestions and comments. From my experience nothing
seems to last very long on this trim, not repainting with the most expense
"trim" paint or the miracle products (Black Again, Something Else or whatever
they are called) , I have tried them all without long lasting results. The only
permanent solution I have found is to replace the trim with the latest version
from Porsche (which is a black plastic and will never fade,rust or chip, but
you cannot tell the difference) , it cost me approximately $40-50 for both
quarter window trim sets complete. It is however a pain in the ____ to install ,
but well worth it once completed.

Concerning the rear wing I would try using a very soft brush (horsehair) with
your normal car wash solution to try and get the wax residue off of the wing. If
that doesn't work try a 50/50 solution of water and Castrol's Super Clean, just
make sure you rinse thoroughly and try to keep it off of the paint or at least
keep water running over the paint while cleaning the wing.

Once the wing is clean, you can use the same product that you use on your tires.
I have been using Armor All's FLASHBLACK with great success. This will keep the
wing looking like new and give it a nice sheen.

Brian Buxton is our resident auto detailer expert and maybe he can give us some
of his "trade secrets" concerning this issue.
