 If it does what it
claims the thermostat will just compensate and maintain the same
temperature. In the hot hot hot situation above it would allow the
thermostat to maintain control for longer and when the temperature gets
out of the loop it would delay the time before the electric fan came on
and would also speed up its cycling time. Not a bad thing I guess. My
opinion, and any and all are welcome to disagree of course, is why
bother. Even if it does what it claims the only time you might see a
difference is in an over temperature condition and a lower temperature
fan switch might be a better choice. Of course, if its dirt cheap and
causes no detrimental effects there's not much to loose I guess. I'm off
my soap box now.

  Well from what I've seen of the german cooling setups, the coolant
circulating around the block during warmup is still free to just circulate
within the block even during an overheat condition, which would almost
have to contribute to it. Water wetter doesn't claim to be a cure all,
just extra insurance and breathing room. I've seen instances in which
the approx 20 degree drop was enough to make performance acceptible
in an otherwise problem vehicle. It's also a lot cheaper than a new/rodded
out radiator and can cover for a worn water pump. While I'm unfamiliar with 
the cooling sys on 928's specifically, I'd say that if loaded to the point
thatgetting temp out of the block was a problem you could hard wire the 
rad fan and water wetter would still lower running temp considerably.
