I don't know if my previous message got throught to either you or the digest.
 So here goes again.

European Auto Wholesale (Sid is the owner, I bought a 49K mile '85 S from him
a couple of years ago) has an S4 for sale.  I think it is an '87, and I think
it is a lot higher than your price range, but you might want to at least go
look at it.

A&P specialties (Alan is the owner, very 928 knowledgable) in east portland
is a reliable, fast, honest, and reasonably priced shop.  What more could you
ask for?  It is a bit of a drive if you live on the west side, but then again
I have a list of west side shops you should avoid, and the reasons why, if
you are interested.  Alan should remember the car (above, Gran Prixe White)
and me (Brian Robinson), for what it's worth.  He always treated me very
well, and I would like to return the favor to him.

Any other Portland specific advice, let me know.
