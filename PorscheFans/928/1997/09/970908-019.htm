Poop does not get any straighter than that. I wanted to respond to the
percentage 'o aluminum question but could not say it any better than the
above! 

Isn't that why all of us are drawn to these cars anyway, because their
design and construction is so outrageous? No compromise, clean sheet of
paper, cost no object. Not even the air cooled guys can say that.

So if you think the aluminum hood on any 928 keeps it from cornering
properly than I think you should buy a '73 Corvette and join another
group.
