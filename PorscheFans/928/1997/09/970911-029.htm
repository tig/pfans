Several years ago I organized a local PCA event for a show and tell at one
of the best (if not the best) body and paint shops in the Metro DC area.
They have the most state-of-the-art frame straightening machines as well
paint spray booths to die for. I digress. During the discussion and demo of
the frame straightening machine someone asked "Which car required the most
force to straighten?" Mike (one of the owner's) said "It's a tie between the
pre-GM Saab 9000 and the Porsche 928." I've also had mechanics that work all
all kinds of iron tell me that "the 928 is built like a sports car tank".

I suppose aluminum cars built by manufacturers that don't do their homework
will probably be less rigid than the steel cars they also build. Making some
asertion on the rigidity of the 928 based on the rigidity of an aluminum
car, from a manufacturer that has not had a good track record for making
decent steel cars, is rediculous. Remember, Ralph Nader showed that the rear
engine Corvair was "Unsafe At Any Speed". From that, arguments were made
that any rear engine car was unsafe. I guess Porsche and Volkswagen don't
know they build "unsafe" cars. What poppy-cock!!

Consider this. If you knew that you would be involved in a head on collision
with another car (not truck) of about the same weight as the one you're
driving, which car (not truck) would you prefer to be in? Based on the
evidence and stats that I've seen, I'll take the 928.

You're mileage and opinion may varry. However, it does make for an
interesting discussion.

Happy motoring. Ed
