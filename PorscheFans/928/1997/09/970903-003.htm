Although I have never had any work done by him, I have heard that Jeff Huber 
in Tulsa does good work. I know he is mentioned by others in the club.

By the way, do you live in Tulsa? If so, and if you haven't looked into the 
PCA yet, the Cimarron Region is very active. We meet each Saturday morning 
for breakfast at Betty Ann's Restaurant on 45th & Memorial at 8:30. It is a 
great way to meet other club members to see if you are interested in joining 
and you get a chance to see some fabulous cars. Currently there are only 
three members driving 928s and I'm always looking for fellow shark lovers.
