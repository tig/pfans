My point was, choose the NARROWEST multigrade range for your climate &
driving.  The broader the spread in weights, the more unstable additives
are used....and you start losing the ability to extend drain intervals,
cause it breaks down sooner, more like a petro.

>>BTW, do you work for Redline, or just buy their overpriced oil?

I sell Red Line as a sideline business.  Overpriced?  Depends on what
you're looking for.  Red Line is a superior product to Mobil 1 (25% less
friction in the engine oils, for instance), but yes, it costs more
(sugg. retail is $7.95 a quart, but lots of retailers mark it up more
than that).  If you're just driving an ordinary street car, and trying
to extend your engine life, you might have a hard time noticing the
difference in wear between Mobil 1 and Red Line engine oils.  If you're
interested in horsepower, you'll get 1-3% more with Red
Line....important probably only if you're racing.

Why do I use it in my street vehicles?  For a difference of maybe $30 a
year, I can put the best performing oil in my 928, rather than the 2nd
best.  

>>Redline's 10W40 will give you a pour point of better than -40F (-40C)
>>anyway!

>ANY synthetic will.

Yes!  So why choose the 5W50 instead of a 20W50 like the factory
recommends?

A Civic is hardly an stressed engine!

This is what I heard on another list....and Castrol's response was
apparently that it was designed to leave those deposits--never
understood how that could be a good thing!
