  As a matter of fact, I just finished installing new steel lower ball
  joints last night.  It really wasn't very difficult and could probably
  be completed in just over an hour.  I spent extra time cleaning up the 
  suspension while everything was apart.
  
  These are the steps I took on my '83.  Note that the front suspension
  design is different on cars with 4-piston calipers (late '86->), but 
  the same steps _should_ apply.
  
  REMOVAL:
  
  1) Acquire a forged pickle fork (i.e. wedged 2 prong fork - mine was 21/32")
     or a ball joint removal tool.
  2) Jack up one side and remove the wheel.
  3) Remove the two bolts that hold the brake caliper to the steering knuckle.
     Remove caliper and carefully support to remove tension from the brake 
     lines.  There is no need to remove the brake pads from the caliper.
  3a) (Optional) Remove the two screws that hold on the brake rotor and remove
      the rotor.  I did this so that I could inspect the rotors.
  4) Remove the brake cooling deflector shield by removing the nut and
     washer from the lower shock mount.  Do not remove the bolt from the
     lower shock mount.  Note:  the brake cooling deflector shield is the
     (basically) rectangular piece of metal that is mounted on top of the
     lower control arm; this is _not_ the round sheet metal piece that is
     behind the brake rotor.
  5) Loosen the nut at the top of the ball joint until the top of the nut
     is flush with the top of the ball joint threads.  Space was extremely
     limited on my '83, so I was forced to use a box end wrench instead of
     a socket, but the torque spec was only 43lb/ft so this wasn't difficult.
  6) Insert pickle fork between spindle and ball joint and then strike the
     pickle fork with a large hammer.  This should separate the ball joint
     from the spindle.  Don't remove the nut at the top of the ball joint yet.
  7) Note the position of the the eccentrics in the ball joint support and
     mark the position of the ball joint support relative to the lower
     control arm.  (Note: if upgrading from aluminum to steel ball joints,
     the size of the ball joint support is so different between the old and
     the new that there is really no way to try to reassemble the new parts
     in the same position as the old.)
  8) Remove the two nuts that attach the ball joint support to the lower
     control arm.
  9) Remove the nut at the top of the ball joint and remove the ball joint
     from the car.
     
  INSTALLATION:
  
  1) Installation is the reverse of removal with one exception.  When
     attaching the nut to the top of the ball joint, the ball joint _may_
     turn as torque is applied.  To prevent this from happening, apply
     downward pressure on the upper control arm to force the lower ball
     joint to seat in the spindle.  To apply pressure, I used a two foot
     long section of pipe that I wrapped in rags and inserted under the
     lower spring perch while pressing down on the upper control arm.  This 
     stopped the ball joint from spinning and allowed the nut to be 
     tightened properly.     
  2) Reinstall all components to proper torque specs.  I applied Loc-Tite as 
     well.
  3) Get the car aligned.
