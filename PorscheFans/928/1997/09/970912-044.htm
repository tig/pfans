Crossdrilling is a really nifty racing trick where used rotors get tossed after
each race or two.  As for everyday use with occasional (ahem) hard usage I think
you're on your own and should seriously contemplate not only what happens if a
rotor should fail but also Bob DeVore's advice against using drilled rotors on
the 928.

That said (and I'm only offering suggestions so don't sue me) stock front rotors
are gas-slotted already.  I've only heard of aftermarket rear rotors that have
been drilled. Don't know if they've been chamfered also.  Someone has already
posted how to get caliper painting kits from FoliaTec and I think NOPI has 'em
too.  They just came out with SS brake lines that can be covered with brightly
(or not) colored tubing so that should cover the hey-those-are-cool department.
Unknown whether they are DOT approved or not so again caveat emptor.

Rotors are cheap, life isn't.  Weigh the risks and make your call.  Jim, I know
you're reading this - imagine we went '6/10ths' that night going downhill and on
a heavy braking section before one of those U-turns over a cliff a front rotor
busted up!  Of course you're pretty religious about inspecting your car and would
pull a rotor pair immediately at the first signs of stress cracking...

Hmmm.  No, I'm not loosing my nerve but advising caution and serious thought now
because as we all know this car in particular can have you going so fast all the
components better be up to the task.  Drilled rotors rank up there with replica
wheels IMO...  Ok for puttering around but when the going gets really serious ...
(BTW Good Luck Devek Performance at the Pony Express this weekend - I think both
Susan and Marc are in the Super Sport Division 160 - 170mph ; 180mph tech speed -
that's serious!)

Back to lurking,
