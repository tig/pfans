Should I tell you about being the first car, in a four car accident, with 
driver number four doing 26 thousand dollars worth of damage to the other
three 
cars.  And having only 10 thousand worth of insurance.  I lost my 500 dollar 
deductible as did the other three people involved in this mess.  Everyone but

driver of car four had a new or expensive car with collision on it.

According to Murphy's law that must be why he hit you...

How many years have you been driving, and how often has this happened to you?
Get the calculator out!

Wow, I really started some discussion here! I do not mean to provoke anybody
- I just tend to not follow the crowd before I have thoroughly questioned the
crowd's direction. Marketing people just love the niches that the crowd
misses... ;-)

Well, since there was no negative reaction to my other 9 cost saving
suggestions, I guess I averaged pretty well... :-)
