(surmissed from e-mail address)
                                     C: both
(your corner-balancing page is nearly beyond my feeble brain)
(Oh, by the way, thanks for the good info. provided on your web pages)=20

Could I get some clarification on this alignment post?  ......See below..=

Could you explain this (4) part?  I guess the "p" in the second part of t=
he
formula is throwing me off.  (do you mean"d")=20
(is it basicly 600"?)   =20
