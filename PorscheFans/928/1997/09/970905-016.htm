When you say your engine freewheeled without a problem, you mean after
it was at45 degree BTDC??  Or could you freewheel at any crank
location??

Just curious

Stephane,

I had the crankshaft locked at the specified mark (TDC I think) and I rotat=
ed the camshafts through the entire 360 degrees a couple of times (without =
the timing belt on of course) trying to get the index marks to line up perf=
ectly.  It's a little touchy because as you get close the valve spring pres=
sure tends to make the cam move a little more than you want, so you just go=
 around again.  Then I noticed that my Crankshaft mark was just a hair off =
the indicator, so I took the flywheel lock off and rotated the crankshaft a=
ll the way around a couple of times until I was satisfied it lined up perfe=
ctly (you have to make sure the distributor rotor points to #1 cylinder spa=
rk plug wire of course).  As it turned out, I didn't have to be quite that =
precise. It somewhat depends on where the teeth on the belt fall on the gea=
rs.

Anyway, I pretty much rotated everything without any problem (although I di=
d not rotate the camshafts at any other crank position).  I think Kim Crumb=
, in his Panorama article, says that this is a NON-interference engine.  Th=
at's why I wasn't afraid to do this.  (or maybe I'm just dumb!)

Hope this helps.
