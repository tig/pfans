Congratulation to Ed for the frenzy.  The location and planification
were impecable.  It would be hard to top that performance in the
Vie (in french that means life.  Lets see, 928 for life!!)  Oh well,
still a little tired from the 13 hours drive.  Not because of the car
but due to the other non 928 driver on the road.  The other problem
is that the car is only  happy at 95+ miles/hour and the states police
do not agree with this...  Just think of it, I should have made the
trip in 6 or 7 hours if I safely respected the limit of my vehicle.  
Following government regulation doubled that.

The trip back was not as eventful as the drive down there.  I did not
brake another power steering belt (Ed, thank AGS again for the use
of the lift to replace the belt) but I now have a speedometer that
does not work when the car is cold.  I guess its my turn to take the pod
off and clean the contact.

Well, I already said too much but Thanks again to Ed and hope to be
there next year.
