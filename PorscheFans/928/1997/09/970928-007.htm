Hi!  I am considering buying a 928, so I've been looking in all the local
papers (Portland Oregon area).  I don't have too much to spend, so I'm
looking in the under $10,000 range.  I am concerned about the dependability
as a daily driver (about 90 miles a day, 4 days a week) and the traction on
Snow and Ice.  I am also wondering about the typical maintenance costs.  I am
mechanically inclined and can do major repairs and change transmissions,
rearends, etc., but I don't have the equipment to work on fuel injection or
in-car computers.  Anyway, I'm wondering if any of you long term owners of
late 70s/early 80s 928s can give me advice on what to look for (and look out
for) when checking over a used 928 before buying it.  I've also heard that
there were problems with the clutch on the early 928s and that an automatic
is better.  One last question:  The early 928s have less power than the later
ones ('85 and up?) and I'm wondering if it is still pretty quick ( I had an
automatic 1984 Mustang GT convertible-4428 lbs. and 205 horsepower, and I
wasn't very impressed) and how the handling is on tight corners ( I have
about 10 miles of twisty mountain road and 30 straighter miles on my daily
commute).  Thanks In Advance.
