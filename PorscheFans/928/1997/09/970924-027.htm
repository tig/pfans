Sounds like someone had "desmogged" your 928 , this should be going to a 
vacuum
controlled check valve that sends air from your air pump to your "cat" or
bypasses to your airbox .


The sensor in the air intake box is for air temperature.

The large rubber tube goes to the air pump check valve as Dave say's. If 
you look carefully at the smaller connection you should find that it does 
not actually have a hole through it. It seems to serve no purpose at all. 
Mine is the same.
