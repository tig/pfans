Hi Rich:

>>Today I EMAILed a British friend and asked him to check with his local
London Porsche dealer about Euro-model 928 service manual availability
(specifically left hand drive for we Yanks).  I also have fast driving
friends in Germany that could procure them, however, those manuals will be
in German.  

You might find that these manuals are not available to the public in Europe.
As far as I know there are no laws requiring manufacturers to make this
information available, so they keep them for their own dealers.

After high school I worked in the office of a combined body shop (all brands)
and Renault dealer. If there were any issues with other cars than Renaults,
they had to call the dealers, from which they bought the brand-specific
parts.

>> I called Steve Taub Inc. (310) 393-9922 and ordered the workshop manuals
on
special for $236.60 (regularly $286.75).  They said they're going fast.

Sounds like you got a good deal!

>> Drive 'em like they're intended, "ganz schnell"

.... but they're also fun when driven "langsam".
