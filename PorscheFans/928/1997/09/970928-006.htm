Hi All!

I normally dont have anything to contribute, but when I saw the mention of
GIECO, I had to get in my .02.  
How can I say this delicately? How about, GEICO SUCKS!.  I had State Farm on
my 85 928 5 speed in the late 80's, early 90's.  Then I married my wife, who
had GEICO on her Honda, and she got a quote on all of our vehicles, and GEICO
blew the Farm away.  Thought, this is great.  lets change.  6 months go by,
and our renewals come along, and voila! Suddenly the Porsche becomes a
performace car with an additional 
$500. surcharge, over and above the premium, which now puts us above State
Farm....by $250. on the 928 alone, plus an increase on the other cars which
now puts us way over my old premiums.  

And if they find out if you have a radar detector, they will cancel you
instantly.  Happened to 2 friends.  And they DO buy radar equipment for the
police departments.  It has nothing t do with their being caring and
concerning.  More radar=more tickets issued=higher premiums for you and me.
 Nice, huh.  

And on the issue of 3 year old gas in the tank, take the tank off and have it
cleaned at a radiator shop.  Dont EVEN risk ruining the pump, injectors and
rest of the system by trying to run the crap through.  Been there!

I enjoy this page.  I am on my 3rd 928, a 79 5  speed.  I miss my 85
terribly, but it was replaced at the time by my new daughter.  Tough
decision!  I hope to have an S4 one of these days!
