The owners manual for my model or maybe the service manuals referred to the
slats as being a device to stop airflow over the motor in extremely cold
conditions. They were thermostatically controlled and I assume the idea was
to reduce airflow over the motor and allow it to reach its optimal operating
temperature. This was consistent with what my mechanic had said and so I
didn't argue with him.

Did the purpose of the slats change in the later releases or do these
wonderously unique features actually have multiple benefits? :-)

I can understand a parrot mistaking a wall mirror for a whole other room but
you'd think he'd at least try to avoid the head-on collision with the other
bird...
