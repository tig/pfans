From what you've described, my conclusion is that the previous person 
that worked on your 928 did not align the belt correctly.  I would 
realign per the markings and re-adjust the ignition timing.  Also, on 
the 32-valves engine, belt tension is CRITICAL because of the low 
valve-head clearance.  If done improperly, it'll cost you possibly the 
whole engine.  Porsche has a tool specifically made for this but it is 
very expensive.  I've yet to hear anyone using a non-Porsche belt 
tensioning tool with success.  If so, I would like to hear from them.  
Good luck!

>I recently obtained an '86 928, S model (66K) and immediately had to 
replace

the

those on

notches on

from

>(clockwise, of course!) to align the two marks.
