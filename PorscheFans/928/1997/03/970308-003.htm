No, but I have seen the FIKSE site. You didn't get there because you're
misspelling their name.

Yes, they are that good.

These are significantly stronger and significantly lighter than Porsche
wheels or any of the replicas. If you drive very hard, or just want to be
very safe, the strength is useful. The light weight is always useful,
particularly if you've gone to wider tires, which weigh more; unsprung
weight matters a lot to stability on less-than-perfectly-smooth pavement.

DOT and TUV approvals come from testing stringent enough to knock out many
replicas, but those standards are not as high as what Porsche applies,
which is why you should not use any old replica. The Fikse, HRE, and racing
BBS wheels are made to higher specifications (though no non-partisan
standard) than Porsche wheels.

Devek's spiffy wheels are made for them by HRE to Devek's offset specs, and
are at this same exalted level of strength and light weight.
