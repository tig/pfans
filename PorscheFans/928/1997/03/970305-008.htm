	My car has 17' Antera's (#121) with BFG's 245's front, and 275's rear, I have 
no problems with my tires holding air. My rims are not chrome, and they do not 
have the hidden valve stem (disguised as a lug-nut hole in the bolt pattern) 
like the new 121's. I would have the tire checked for leaks, the valve stems 
replaced, I hope they are not rubber, and I would have the wheel checked for 
cracks or corrosion. A wheel exploding at speed would probably be worse than 
losing some air. If the rim(s) is(are) OK then have the tire checked by a BFG 
rep. 
	I once saw a semi on I-5 that had a front rim explode, I was on the other 
side of the freeway when I saw it happen, the sound was like someone dropping 
a huge dumpster or cargo container out of the sky and onto the ground. The 
truck scraped up about 300 feet of roadway, and the bodywork and bumper and 
other deri were flying in all directions. If that stretch of freeway didn't 
have a 200 foot wide median, I probably would not be here today!

Hope you find the problem!
