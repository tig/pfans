 Brian thanks for the reply. This is the second 928 i have owned and have
never done any maintenance. Would like to start doing some of the more
ridimentary things. I am out at Little Rock AFB for a 5 month flight school
and thought i would at lest change my oil. From what i have read here i
think my ATM is working fine. Yesterday i accelerated to 140mph and it did
not shift up to 4th. Had to back off and was not over 6000 rpm. Compared to
the East coast there is very little highway patrol out here in Arkansas.
How many miles on your car? 93300 on mine.
