Hi all!

Some time ago I wrote asking for suggestions to fix an a/c problem.  Got
several, which I followed up on.

Here's what's happened and my new question.

The problem is that I've fried my climate control unit.  I mean *fried*!.
The circuit board traces were melted and the relay on the rear of the board
was fused.  I put a new unit in and got that burning smell again (I cut the
a/c real quick so the damage was limited).  

I traced all the wires from the climate control to the compressor.  No
shorts.  Except....  I have nearly zero resistance at the plug in front of
the right camshaft cover where the compressor magnetic clutch wire surfaces. 

I put a fuse in line with the magnetic clutch wire and I *also* put a fuse
on the climate control unit (ain't no way I want to buy another one of those
expensive units!).  Now, before I try my luck with fuses I want to determine
if there's a short in the compressor clutch.

Here's the question:  should the magnetic clutch wire read nearly 0 ohms
resistance?  Of course, the engine is off and the ignition is too when I
checked this.

Now, here's a request.  Would someone be so kind as to measure the
resistance on his/her car's compressor clutch wire?  The wire runs on the
front of the right side timing belt cover and branches to the electric air
switch that hangs on the cross member brace in the front of the engine
compartment.  You can check by putting one test lead from an ohm meter on
the cross member mounting bolt and the other in the end of the plug leading
to the compressor.  

I'd be delighted to know if you find a near-zero resistance, an infinite
resistance, or something inbetween.

This info would help me decided if I need to buy a new compressor.

Thanks in advance for any and all help!!
