Howdy All!

Thought that I would post that I know of a good car for sale for racing or
restore.  It needs some body work and interior work, but would be a
great platform to start racing with.  It is a 5-speed and apparently has an
orginal S4 engine(Apparently that was an option that year?).  What the
car really needs is some TLC.  If anyone is interested, I am sure :), that
the current owner would part with very easily.  He is definitely in over
his head.  

I drove the car yesterday, which has new D40M2's!  It has a lot of
potential.  Only 54,000 miles, but there are a lot of little things to do,
which we all know can add up to a lot!  But, the engine, and drive train
seem to be in very good condition.  But, the clutch needs to be replaced. 
Any guess on what type of clutch this car has?  But, I assume that


potential transmission problems could be masked by that.  

If anyone is interested, let me know by e-mailing me directly

matthewbutler@fsd.com

The car is in the Washington DC area.

Chow,

Matt Butler
