>>
Gee, I always wanted to be a guru of something, but I'm not sure being
a self-appointed one is so good. Incidentally, my service manual was
cheap - it's on fiche - that's why I have such a hard time trying to
read the bracklefritzing schematics.

>>
It looks to me as though the fan speed is controlled only by the multi-
position switch, and by the defrost relay (on the monster relay panel).
And the defrost relay should only be actuated when the slider is in
the defrost position. Nevertheless, on my car and at least one other
on this list, the fan occasionally goes to high speed for a few
seconds, then back to normal. I haven't been able to correlate this
with any other event, and sometimes it doesn't happen for several
months, then five times in ten minutes. Spooky, but too intermittent
to chase down so far.

>>experiences on this problem? I would really like to get this fixed and I see
>>another Digester with a similar problem. One answer to fix both people?
>>
I think the switch itself is one suspect here - they seem to be 
inclined to fail in a somewhat intermittent way.
