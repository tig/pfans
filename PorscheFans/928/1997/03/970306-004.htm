Actually his may not be such a pain, since it's RHD. On the LHD
cars, the problem is that the clutch master cylinder is buried
in the fender, so you have to take quite a few pieces out to
get access to it. Nothing complicated, just tedious. It may be
a lot more exposed on the RHD car. On the other hand, maybe
you have to pull the engine to get to it!
