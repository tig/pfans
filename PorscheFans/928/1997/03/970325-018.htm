Now I am lost...

Let me describe it in terms I understand :)

I removed the distribtor cap, behind it, there is a black circle
held in place by a small plastic arm (about 1.5").  The arm is
held in place by 1 screw.

The gear you are mentionning, is it the gear driving the cam and
driven by the timming belt??

Or do you mean the valve cover itself??

Thanks for the help,
