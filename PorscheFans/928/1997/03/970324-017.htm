Next digest.....

I have a 90' 928S-4. In normal operating ambient outside temp of 80degrees,
 my car runs at the 3/4 mark on the temp gauge (white mark). The motorized
flaps in front of the radiator work fine. New water pump, timing belt,
radiator works properly, thermostatic fans work properly, come on just a hair
above 3/4 mark, then cools down to just slightly below 3/4 mark. I'm ASSUMING
thisis correct operatingtemp? Any members with 89-91 that want to comment?.
It stays at 3/4 whether it's 70 degrees or 95 degrees outside. Comments
welcome.

Also, ANYBODY that has there 1990 model with Air Pressure Sensor System
wheels still on their car, (and electrically connected) knows that the fronts
are at  36psi, and the backs at a ridiculous whopping 44psi MINIMUM PRESSURE
according to factory, so light doesn't come on. NOW, all other years use 36
psi front and 36 psi back, only 1990 with 44 rear. This is asinine, the
Dunlops maximum inflation pressure is 44psi!!. I have a fix.....

Pull the pairs of 36psi sensors out of a host set of front wheels, (purchase
new sealing rings at your dealer) and remove your rear 44's. Put in the 36's.
WOW, what a ride and what handling . Your 929 no longer disconnects the
vertabrae in your spine on the concrete freeway and over bumps. You heard it
from the cookie man!
