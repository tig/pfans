If you need to keep the price down, try the Continental CZ 91. Porsche put
them on 928s, they do everything well except wear, and they're remarkably
inexpensive.

If price doesn't matter so much, try the Bridgestone S-02, the Michelin
Pilot SX MXX3 (in Porsche's N0 spec), or (with reservations about quality
control) the Pirelli PZero. All of these are fitted by Porsche to their
fastest cars and are in the top class of performance tires.

I've been conducting a campaign against BFG Comp T/As, which don't seem to
suit the 928's suspension and have real QC problems. None of the Goodyear
tires works well on 928s either. If you're mad for Dunlop, hold out for the
SP 8000s, but I think you'll do better with one of the tires listed above.

Meanwhile, if you're going to lay out for good tires, you might want to
consider spending a relatively small additional amount and getting GTS
wheels and tires. They work considerably better than the stock sizes with
insignificant increase in stiffness.

Be leery of generic replica wheels; you've got a heavy, powerful car, and
Porsche's wheels exceed DOT and TUV standards. You may want to call Wheel
Enhancement (310/836-8908) and talk to Robert Wood, who can set you up with
a nice package of correctly fitting and sound wheels and tires for a nice
price.
