Hah!  That 993 musta' been surprised, what with his head-start and all... 
That was what bracket racing a slower car felt like, a launch delay then an
all-out persue and pass run...  The frustrating part was racing against a
faster 1/4 mile car and not being able to keep my foot in it past that mark
to reel them back in at top speed.

I would think the weight of the 928 and the very limited tire sizes prevent
ultimate stopping power.  You can't do too much about either without
compromising on aesthetics and/or comfort.  Many accolades have been
praised on the S4 and later brakes so maybe an upgrade is in store for your
car?  I don't want to sound like a commercial but if I wasn't in the market
for an S4, I would seriously consider Devek Performance's big brake
package, especially since I want to get involved in road racing (and have
found myself in similar street situations which I am trying to avoid).

Hey Troy, did you do the big brake upgrade and if so, what are your
impressions / measured results if available?  Anyone else have any hot tips
on fluids & pads ie. ATE SuperBlue, etc.?  I think this discussion just
went around once so a search of the archives might be helpful too...

Though I still secretly want another 911, make mine an S4 for now!!! 
Porsche that is...
Phil
