Back in February, I posted details of my servicing experience with a Sydney
Porsche dealer... costs, items replaced/repaired.  Since purchasing the
car, the car had intermittently run on four cylinders, mainly when it had
built up some heat while sitting in traffic.  The car had been back frequently
but the guys were unable to find it.  In fact, until about four weeks ago, they
were unable to induce the fault at all.  Driving home from work one day,
(I usually take the train in !) the car started to produce its worst and
fortunately, we were not far away from the Mechanics.  Rushed in and they
analysed the fault immediately; they were anxious to hook up an oscilloscope,
or CRO.  They traced the fault to the fuel injection system, then turned the
motor off to investigate further.  They restarted it, and ofcourse, the fault
did not re occur !  

Went back in again last week and this time the misfire was beginning the 
minute the motor was started.  Further investigation revealed melting of 
plastic bits around wires relating to the fuel injection; not sure which
bits, and wish I had a photograph.  The melted bits were removed, do not
know if anything was replaced, but while they were down there, the mechanics
cleaned the injectors as well.

When the service manager phoned me, he was his usual cautious self and advised
that he "thought" they had found the fault.  He had used those words many times
before, but this time indeed they had found the fault.

The plastic bits or insulation appear to have been melted by contact with the
engine on a regular basis.  In traffic, the temp would naturally have been a lot
higher than open road driving thus explaining why the problem rarely occurred in
freeway or open road travel.  

Something else I noticed for the first time today, and yes, feel like a real DIL,
.... I heard the fan engage for the first time when the car started.  I have not
checked with the dealership on whether any work was done on the fan.  Maybe
it came back on once these melted bits were removed and the injectors were looked at.
It just reinforced my perception that maybe the heat build up was as a result
of no cooling.  The car had always run fairly warm in traffic, but I just put
this down to the fact that it was built in Europe where temperatures are low,
and the car was primarily set up for those conditions.  Is it possible that
the fan had not run for all this time, or perhaps it had run intermittently ?
(Rhetorical question)

Its so good to have the car back from the dead, and the dealer.  It now
goes like a freight train with MIG29 afterburners fitted.

Full marks to the dealership; its not easy to trace a problem like this and
many people often equate the time taken to find a fault with apathy and disinterest.

In the computer and software industry, most large manufacturers and developers will
often commence a database on a new product to record faults that are experienced
worldwide.  I know Porsche has Service Updates and Bulletins but a little bit
more needs to be done in this area; a central database, preferably world wide
is the way to go.  Mechanics and dealerships could then consult the DB, and maybe
find a match with the symptons.
