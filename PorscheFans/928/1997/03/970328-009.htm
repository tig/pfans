If you were going to put 18" wheels on your car, you'd probably use 8"
width up front and 10" in the rear. If I were doing this, I'd probably go
for the Bridgestone S-02 in the sizes used on the current 911 Turbo
(225/40x18 f, 265/35x18 r), which are the same rolling radius as the GTS
tires (and pretty much the same as what's on you car now, and I do advise
that you not go far from the standard rolling radius).

However, I'll share my experience along these lines with you. I was going
to do precisely what I just described, using either the Technology wheel or
the OZ Mito modulars, but discussed this with everyone I knew who was
knowledgeable about both rolling stock and 928 cars, including Autosport
Design, Wheel Enhancement, Devek, and Kim Crumb (PCA's 928 tech honcho).
The unanimous response, couched in no uncertain terms, was "DON'T GO TO 18
INCH WHEELS ON THE 928!"

The reasons were:

	- excessively stiff ride (due to the short sidewall), spoiling the touring
character of the car

	- rim bending and related problems due to potholes and bumps (again, the
short sidewall, offering very little cushioning to the rim)

So, I wound up with technology wheels in 17" diameter (Wheel Enhancement's
approved-by-Robert replicas in GTS sizes: 7.5"  f, 9" r), which, let me
assure you, look MUCH bigger than the stock S4 wheels, fitted with my
personal favorite Michelin Pilot SX MXX3 N0 tires (in GTS sizes: 225/45x17
f, 255/40x17 r).

These look very nice (the soft look of the spokes and rim complement the
swoopy lines of the car), pretty much fill the stock wheel wells (but make
no rubbing or other internal contact), and work extremely well.

Meanwhile, if you do change wheel and tire sizes, you'll need to have all
four wheels aligned. Staying with your stock settings will result in soggy
handling through no fault of the rolling stock. No, I don't know the
numbers; this work is done for me by Autosport.

If you don't having any experience in installing one, then I would 
strongly recommend getting it done commercially. I had mine replaced 
about 4 years ago at a cost of $450 by a glass company in Norcross.  If 
you decide to tackle it yourself, you can find one for about $150-250 
used and you need to spend an additional $30-50 for the installation 
kit; seal, adhesive and primer, etc.   If you don't prep the seal and 
windshield correctly, you'll end up having a leaky windshield.  I've 
seen an 928 with a corroded electrical/relay panel and it is a mess.
Don't mean to scare you.  Just my .02 worth.
