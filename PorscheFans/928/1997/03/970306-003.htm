Possibly the boot on the injection unit ( I don't have any familiarity with
the 928 layout in order to tell you where to look, it should be fairly
obvious; but I have dealt with CIS on several other cars and one of them had
this problem) is torn, or cracked.  I would also expect that the injectors
are either dirty or worn out.  Finally, could be a vacuum leak, listen
closely for the sucking sounds, and see if any get louder as you open the
throttle a little.
