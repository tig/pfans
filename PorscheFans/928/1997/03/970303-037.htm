|Because it has at least the S4 or possibly even the GTS brakes.
|
Even with GTS brakes you will NOT compete with the 993. It is a simple matter of
weight (mass) and the distribution. The 993 is lighter and all the weight is as
far rearward as possible. This makes the 993 a *perfect* car for minimising
braking distance. BUT just don't try any deep braking while not in a straight
line with a 993, you may see where you have just been very quickly!

Also you need to take into account the brake biasing system. This restricts
the braking force to the rear of the car. The 993 and the 928 both have brake
biasing systems. This is what makes both the cars understeer while turning
slightly and braking hard. The factory does this to make the cars safer for
people driving over their ability.
If you know what you are doing you can adjust this and make the rear do more
work. This should not normally be done for a non tracked car though. I say
again, the factory set the car up to be SAFE on the road. Some of us though
want to push the limits up a little ;-)

Adamant King 928GTS (Indischrot).
