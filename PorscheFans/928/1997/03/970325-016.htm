According to the Porsche shop manual, positioning the camshaft to the 
45 degree mark will allow you to move the crankshaft.  Intresting...

I just cleaned the bi-metallic disk.  If you want to replace it, the 
cost is $5 EACH from the dealer and that add up pretty quickly.

About the oil leak from a previous thread.. What you have removed 
sounds like the distributer and the o-ring right?  You mentioned a 
single-bolt and that throws me off.  I am talking about the camshaft 
gear housing on the driver-side.  There are three bolts holding it to 
the head.  After removing the gear, you also need to remove the 
distributor drive-gear as well.  As to the type of sealant.  I used 
Permatex; the non-hardening type.
