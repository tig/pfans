Your 928 can start in 1st gear. Call Precision Auto Designs @ 1-800-222-7253.
They are located in Campbell, CA., area code 408. They will do exchange or
outright.

Haul ass in your 928 - don't start like a slug, start in 1st gear with a
mod'ed valve body! Remember, you have a Mercedes-Benz transmission! 

HA!. I just sued M-Benz over my crappy transmission in Lemon Law case. Oh,
well, maybe it was just a "fluke". My 928's trans. is no problem. Maybe M-B
trans's love Porsches, like "I BELONG in here". \

By the way, for 39 down I can get you a great deal on a big house down the
street from me in Rancho Sante Fe. Markets been kinda dead, previous residers
wanted to 
"keep up with the Jones's" I guess. Really, it's right near my house! wonder
if they caught the tail of the comet, but for sure the realestate market in
RSF is on a downslide.

Anybody know where I can get a used radio antannae (roof top) cheap? Mine
keeps getting ripped off at the mall.\
