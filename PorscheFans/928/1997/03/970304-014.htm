>>NOOOooooo! (In a Smithers tone)

>>Where can I find more info on these failures? I've searched the archives, but
>>it looks like there are no archives before Sept. 96 and none of the threads
>>since that date have enough relevent info.

Your friendly Porsche parts source sells a nice little parts catalog
for water-cooled Porsches up to about 1987, for around $10. It has
reprints of a few Porsche tech bulletins, including the one about
the aluminum vs. steel ball joints. Actually, first thing to do is
take a magnet and see if it sticks to the outermost piece of the 
lower control arm. Note that this is NOT a recall, just a product
improvement, and PCNA has apparently shown no interest in helping
pay for the upgrade.
>>> 
>>Leonard said this was the code for "Monterey"

Seems to depend on the year - in mine it means Reno.

>>
>>> 415 - wider rear track (interesting, check it out)
>>
>>Yes, I'd like to check this out in further detail. Any ideas on info sources?

You could call PCNA - 1.800.545.8039 - and see what they say.

>>> 494 - 2 speakers in back
>>
>>Leonard said this was the code for "amplifier system". I think this has
>>been disconnected. A different stereo has been installed. The unit in there
>>sounds like CRAP! Sounds like 2 watts followed by THD. 

Take a look inside the box between the passenger seat and the door.
You might have an auxiliary amp in there, which ought to be a start
at getting some better sound.
