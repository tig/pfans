If they are polished (almost look like chrome), and there is no clear coat
on them (you can find out by licking your wheels, no joke, Larry at CCS
told me about this one, if they are smooth and have a "paint" taste, then
they are clearcoated, if they taste mettalic, they are not. Clean the area
you are licking! If they aren't clear coated, use a metal polish like P21S
Multi-surface finish restorer to shine and clean them. Then use P21S wheel
cleaner to keep them clean. I have the same wheels, and they are a bitch to
clean. If they are clear-coated, I think that the P21S product says it
works on painted surfaces too, but I've never tried it. After you've
polished the wheels, apply a coat of wax like Blitz wax to protect the
surface and help keep it easier to clean.

>>>QUESTION: Are the Devek GTS replica wheels TUV approved?<<<

BridgeStone Potenza SO2, Pirelli PZero, Yokohoma Nexus,...and the other
maximum performance tires from each respective manufacturer,  they are all
good tires, and everyone has their favorites.  I plan on fitting the
BridgeStones on my new GTS wheels.
