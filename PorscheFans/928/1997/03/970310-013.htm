Hi All!

Thanks, again for your replies! I have figured that the black box behind the
monster fuse/relay panel is not connected with the air conditioning system.
It has a part number of 928 641 603.02, has the wording "Ja/Nein
Lampenkontrollgerat" and is made by VDO. When I looked inside, it has a some
coils and what look like reed switches inside the coils as well as some
electronics. I surmise that this unit is to do with trailer lights. Why
anyone would want to tow a trailer with a car like the 928 is beyond me but
on page 24 of my owner's manual it shows a special warning light for the
trailer blinkers. Anyone confirm or deny my supposition?

I have wired an immobiliser into the car as my insurance company won't
provide cover unless the ignition, starter and fuel pump are all passively
disabled. The immobiliser also locks and unlocks the doors for me with a
remote control but, if I forget, the immobiliser passively makes the car
dead 20 seconds after I get out of the car.

I have been given enough information to delve into the air conditioning
system now but I don't know enough about the cruise control to start trying
to fault find it. There has got to be some electronic module somewhere in
the car that relates to the cruise control.

My next job will be the leaking clutch master cylinder. Then the growling
rear wheel bearing. Then the air conditioning (including why it pours cold
water on my foot when leaning into a corner - blocked drain pipe I suppose).
Then one front fog light doesn't work. Then, after a little tickle up of the
interior trim and a minor driver's seat repair and a hand brake adjustment,
the car will be fine!

By the way, someone asked about the light across the front bumper and what
they do. The outer ones are obviously the blinkers, then the first square
ones with the plastic "inserts" are the fog lights with a tiny bulb in the
side for parking. The inner most square lights are simply driving lights and
come on with high beam, they also are the lights that come on when you flash
someone during the day and the main lights are laid back.
