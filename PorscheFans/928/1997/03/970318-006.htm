I don't know how it will sound, or how it will work, but I am very interested
in hearing about the end result.  What prices, complications, and final
results you get from this system.

I think you made a good choice in setting up the system, it will probably be
somewhat louder, but may have a different tone than your stock system.  You
may like, or not.  I think my car could be a bit louder, but the pipes are
run straight out the back, not to the side like on my older one.  How are
your Euro pipes run?  Left side behind the tire, or straight out the back of
the car on the left?
