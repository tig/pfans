If it is a headlight thing it could be to aim them.  Some Euro cars
had this feature I remember reading about in the manuals.

On my car, the little knob near my left knee is for the fader,
but it was wired up by someone for the volume control on the CD
player.

I just finished doing some extensive stereo work to my 928. I think that
what you're looking at might be the front/rear fader knob. I could be dead
wrong (not a first). The emblem is of a speaker, not a headlight. The panel
on the floor is easy to remove. Pull it off and take a look. If there is a
wiring harness connecting to brown, green and blue wires, then this is a
fader knob. I can't imagine that Porsche would ever put a dash control, such
as headlights, on the floor.
