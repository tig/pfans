'Howdy' -

Good luck on your 928 hunt.  Get the right car and you will be rewarded
with miles and miles of the best road experiences in the flagship of the
Porsche line, the line that was to succeed the venerable 911, the almighty
928!!!  Ok, I'll stop the chestpounding (for now)...

Are you looking at a Euro-spec or US-spec car?  Just wondering.  You would
check out a used 928 like any other used car - clear title, registration,
mechanical, appearance, etc.  The big points you want to inspect closely
are brakes (especially front rotors and pads as this is a fairly heavy and
fast car), hopefully recent timing belt change, condition of clutch and
transmission, operation of electrical accessories, steering & related
components.  Always a good idea to get a pre-purchase inspection when you
are really sure of purchasing a particular car, some will say it's
mandantory!  In comparison to potentially costly hidden repairs, a hundred
of so now is a good investment.

It's been said before and worth repeating - the 928 was a very pricey
vehicle when new, at times topping $100k fully optioned (anyone have more
info on this year by year?).  Thus, parts and the labor required to
maintain this type of car are going to be commensurate, know what I mean? 
That's why it's so important to find a well maintained car, so your own
maintenance will be pretty much limited to oil changes, etc. instead of say
a transmission rebuild $$$!!!

But we are so fortunate that this car has been overengineered for
durability that a well maintained car will go for many thousands of miles,
without major incident!  For example, my car has 144k miles and just made a
very good showing at Sear's Point Raceway, posting better quarter mile
times than Porsches' specifications!  Another recent post indicated a 193k
mile 928!  Another just topped 200k (one of Lucky Ekman's).  So this is not
a car to be afraid of with high, serviced mileage.  It might even be a
plus, as the mileage shows regular usage.

As many on the list will attest, if/when you get your 928, you will find
all the assorted musclecars almost constantly in your rear view mirror or
alongside you ready to race.  It's a V8 thing I guess.  The 928 does well
in light of it's long gearing for autobahn storming.  Get it up on the
freeway above 90, hit the gas and not much else will keep up.  This car has
legs!  

Get the best example you can afford, leaving some budget for maintenance
items & fun stuff ie. stereos, wheels, etc.  What is the asking price on
that '80?  Do you know the difference among the various years of 928's? 
You might be in for a pleasant surprise, so looking forward to your posts!


Phil
