How were you getting 26 mpg Hwy?  The best I have been able to record for
instant mileage was about 23-24, and for average mileage on long trips about
19-20.

I never got anywhere near 26 avg.  My mileage didn't seem to change when I
installed the chips.  I mean, it may have changed a little, but nowhere near
6 mpg on average.  

Your new average is now where I have always been, with or without chips.  So
what am I complaining about?
