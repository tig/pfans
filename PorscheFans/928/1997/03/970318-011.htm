Greetings, 928 owners!!  My name's Dzokayi Harris...I've been lurking on
the list for several weeks & checking out the archives...what a wealth of
information!!  I've been a bit reluctant to post since I do not as yet have
a 928, but after seeing so many other aspiring owners out there I thought I
might be able to tap the group for some information....here goes...

Currently I own a 1989 Jaguar XJ-S..black on black, V12...really a nice
car, BUT... for various reasons I have become somewhat dissatisfied with
it....the shaky reliability, rather soft handling, and especially the (lack
of) performance from the V12 engine.  I've liked Porsche 928s from a
distance for some time, but now I'm ABSOLUTELY certain that this is the car
I must have.  Information is rather hard to come by,though... 
 From reading the archives I gather that a well maintained 928 will last a
very long time (193k!)  It also appears that the most recurring problem is
with the climate control system. (I would be glad to have problems like
this!!!) I'm used to setting aside a healthy amount of dough for regular (&
unscheduled maintenance), so this is not a problem....
	I guess the main thing I'm concerned about is how fast the 928 is in the
real world...I'm not a real speed demon, but I enjoy driving a responsive
vehicle, and I'm tired of getting my ass kicked by every highschool punk in
his mustang 5.0....in the Jag I just have to settle for looking good.  
	Now the used Porsche scene here in Amarillo TX is nonexistent....as soon
as I get the Jag sold, I'm going shopping for a 928....probably dallas or
houston, although I hear that prices in miami & southern cali are very
reasonable....any truth to this?  Thing is, I haven't been able to drive
one of the beasts yet, and I haven't been able to tell from the archives,
Devek catalog (I'm still waiting on the 928 performance portfolio to show
up) or any other source on the net which model will provide suficient
performance.  Sufficient meaning power aplenty to blow away those 5.0s,
Z28s, and the like in a traffic light drag.... 	I may be wrong, but seems
like '84 won't do it without modifications.....85 or 86???  I think I'd
really like an 87-88, just 'cause I like to buy the latest I can afford,
especially if an S4 will do the job in stock form.  However, if I can't
swing the dough for one of those, maybe an 85-86 with some mods will do the
trick...I understand that practically nothing will touch a 928 on the
highway...
	In a nutshell....
1.  which years really kick ass

2.  Cheaper to hop up an 85-86 to S4 levels or just get an S4?

but wait, there's the euro versions too......

man oh man....any advice y'all could give me would be greatly appreciated,
and I'd be really happy to hear from owners with a ride range of model
years.  thanks in advance!!
