My '89 rides at a little less than half guage (not at any mark) when it's
cool out, and runs up to about exactly half when it's merely warm.  In the
hot weather (80 plus) it runs up a little hotter.  When I am in stop and go,
it will always run a little hotter.  At least one fan is running when the
ignition is on.

My '85 recommended 36/44, and my '89 recommends 36/44.  So....all other years
that I know of recommend 36/44, not 36/36.
