NOOOooooo! (In a Smithers tone)

Where can I find more info on these failures? I've searched the archives, but
it looks like there are no archives before Sept. 96 and none of the threads
since that date have enough relevent info.

Gack! I'd like to eliminate some of those if they degrade performance. I'm
in TX so I'm not worried about CA emmissions standards.


> 158 - some radio

Leonard said this was the code for "Monterey"


> 415 - wider rear track (interesting, check it out)

Yes, I'd like to check this out in further detail. Any ideas on info sources?


> 438 - comfort seat right
> 468 - graduated tint glass
> 494 - 2 speakers in back

Leonard said this was the code for "amplifier system". I think this has
been disconnected. A different stereo has been installed. The unit in there
sounds like CRAP! Sounds like 2 watts followed by THD. 

I'm not real excited about going into that console, but something must be
done. Don't worry. One of my degrees is in EE. Actually, I'll start with a
check of the speakers. There may be an impedence mismatch or phase problem.
There are a couple of cheap Jensen boxes in the back. I believe that the
factory speakers are disconnected altogether. I have some EV studio monitors
which I'll hook as a test to determine the weak link.


> 650 - sunroof

Where do I find a motor for this? The original is  g o n e.


Thanks John and Leonard.
