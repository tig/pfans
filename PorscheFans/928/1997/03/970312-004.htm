Paul Hatziiliades, your recent "let'er rip and gave chase" story got my
adrenelan flowing! I, too, have been afflicted with a higher level of this
"squiditis". I say "higher" because my trusty ol' SER packs a satisfying
lbs/hp ratio which allows me to squirt through and accelerate past most of
those blasted "Kentucky road blockers" out there. It seems that Austin, TX
(where I live and work) is full of lead foot drivers. I moved down from 
Cols, OH about 1.25 yrs ago and was shocked by the overall agressiveness.
There's no such thing as "assured clear distance"...if you make it, someone
will take it. This town is full of squids! But my 928 allows me to be the
slipperiest of them all -- HA! I have to tune my radio to a soft jazz station 
playing elevator music to keep myself in check! 

I love being stopped at red lights and being in a "pole" position. I pray that
another Mustink 5.0 pulls up beside me. That's a pretty easy prayer to have
answered as there are about a bigillion of those in Austin. OK, I guess
mopping those guys up is getting a bit old now. 

But the most satisfying "kill" of all was a Lotus Elan. This guy thought he
was in a quick car. We had several battles between his Elan and my SER.
Suprisingly, my little rice-burner could _almost_ keep up. Very close. Heck,
the SER does a 7.3 0-60.  

Then I got my 928. I kept commuting to work along the same ol' route, all the
time hoping that I'd pair up with that Elan. My dream came true. I mopped the
poor guy up 4 or 5 times in a row! I took off and lurch waaay ahead, then
slowed down to about 60 so that he'd start to catch up. Meanwhile, he still 
had his Elan floored so I remained patient and waited for him to get to
the point where he was just about to pass and then I FLOORED it and killed
him again from 60 to 90! I was about 8 carlengths ahead of him by 90, so
I let up, exercized that patience, waited for him to catch up and KILLED 
him again from about 80 to 110. After the end of the 2 mile straight-away where
this torture was taking place is a hard ramp onto another freeway which we
both take. I think he actually thought that he'd out corner me around that ramp,
so I took it pretty fast, punched it, passed about 30 cars that were part of
the giant "traffic slinky" from backup at the previous intersection traffic
light and zipped onto the next ramp of our commute. As I was watching him in
my mirror, I could tell he was pushing his Elan as hard as it would go, but
it just didn't have what it took to surpass the traffic backup and he was
forced to beg for mercy from the drivers in the backed up traffic so that
they'd let him merge in at a whopping 12 mph!

Even with the elevator music playing, I find my blood pressure rises and my
adrenalan flows whenever I get behind the wheel of my 928.

It's squiditis. It sounds like wreckless behavior, but we know what the 928
can do. We wouldn't own these if we didn't enjoy this level of performance.
It's like having the authority to ride a Ninja amongst the bicyclists during
the Tour de France. In a matter of seconds, you're out in front and there's
no danger of collision out there all by your lonesome. ;=)

Well, I got the car at 80K and since then, gone thru...
2 batteries
3 set of tires
3 brake jobs
2 water pumps
2 timing belts
40+ oil changes
2 clutch jobs

.... I don't know whether the PO changed the shocks or not, but I DO 
know that I've put at least 110K miles into it since I bought it!  Am I 
just one lucky soul or what?

This is the highest mileage 928 I have heard of... What, if you know,
are some of the things that have gone wrong with it over the years???

The last time that I've heard another 928 owner having this problem, he 
found a bunch of illegal drugs stuffed in the tank shortly after he 
purchased the car from a Florida resident...

====================
Someone on this list was only able to get 12 gallons of gas into his 
928 and 
was at a loss as to explain why.  I have another possible explanation.  
The 
plastic gas tank is partially collapsed.  It could have been collapsed 
because 
of an accident or a problem with the tank's venting (or non-venting 
since 
modern cars no longer vent to the atmosphere).

I'm in the market for a set of manuals.. How much did you paid for it?  
And do you have Schiff's telephone number, email, fax?  Thanks.

================
His AOL name is SEAL11, and his name is Barry.  Unfortunately I can't
remember the name of his company.  It is on the east coast, either New
Jersey, or Connecticut if I remember correctly.
