There is a whirring/whineing noise coming from the front torque 
tube/flywheel cover area on my 88S4 automatic. It's not extreemly 
loud and is there in park/neutral and all gears, and increases with 
engine speed. I suspect the torque the torque tube bearings and 
would apreciate any suggestions on isolating before tearing into 
it. My local dealer says that he can disconnect first the front 
drive coupler ,run engine to eliminate engine noise as problem, 
then disconnect driveshaft rear coupler and run engine to eliminate 
torque/converter/trans as problem. He estimates no more than 2.5 
hours to do this. I dont think this is possible to do on a auto 
trans car, esp. without lowering or moving back transaxle assy.
     The trans filter has been serviced and it shifts perfect. 
Anyone had similar experiance?
