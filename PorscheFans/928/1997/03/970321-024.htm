	Welcome!

	[lots of stuff about Jags, 928s, and crappy american
	cars deleted]


	You are going to be thrilled with this car! The 928, that is,
	compared to your old Jag. It's much faster, much better
	handling, much more reliable, much more modern, etc. And you
	absoluetly *will*not* have to worry about any more Mustangs,
	Camaros, or other pretendo-mobiles.

	Well, the GTS is the highlight of the series. I think
	it's out of your price range from what you were saying,
	though. If it were me, I'd get an 88 928S4 5-spd. I see
	them for sale in Dallas from time to time for anywhere
	from 12K (probably in *bad* shape) to 24K (probably in
	*great* shape).

	Just get the S4. Then you'll be ready to go right out of
	the box and it *will* be cheaper in the long run.
	There is a tech at my shop here in Dallas who is regarded
	by many to be the foremost 928 specialist in the Southwest.
	He's been working on them since they came out. If you'd like
	their phone number, drop me a line. I'm sure they'd be happy
	to chat with you about your wants and desires where this
	car is concerned. Good luck!

When you get a chance, remove the driver-side cam gear housing, the one 
directly behind the cam year along with the distributor.  Behind  it, 
you'll find an oil galley about the size of a dime as well as a small 
neoprene washer.  This washer tends to shrink over time and therefore 
loses it's sealing property.  I bet that's where the majority of your 
oil leak comes from.  Reinstall using a good quality sealant.  
Apparently Porsche does not use any type of sealant on the mating 
surface.  It took me almost two years to figure this one out.

Does anybody know of a good place to refinish the wheels on my 928?  
Its the flat-slotted type.  It has its share of curb-surf by PO.  I'm 
located in the SF/Bay area.
