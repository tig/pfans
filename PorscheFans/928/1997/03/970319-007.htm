Dallas and Houston is where I looked at two cars in January.  I found the
pricing in Florida very favorable, but the travel costs were higher.
 Southern CA is also good, but a much longer drive for me (Virginia), and the
prices in FL were better anyway, so I would have gone there first.  You may
have different experience with traveling to FL from where you are.

Start test driving, and go to the library to read all of the articles
available about performance comparison test since the car was introduced.
 You seem to love the look of the car, which is generally the one bad thing
testers have to say about any 928.  They will never begrudge the performance,
or the handling, or the ease with which you can pilot the car at 150 m.p.h.
all day long, with one hand on the wheel.

Which year do you want to beat?  Remember these cars (Camaros and Mustangs,
etc...) have seen dramatic increases in power lately.  Stopligh racing will
be always be measured by a fraction of a second with two fast cars.  


>I may be wrong, but seems like '84 won't do it without modifications.....85
or >86??? 

The '89 I have now replaced a 50K mile '85, and I wouldn't have done it if it
hadn't been run over by a semi.  The '89 has a bit more power, but with as
much HP as we are talking about, either car seemed to have all I needed.  I
chiped the '85, which would have added maybe 20-30 HP on the peak, getting it
to within a hair of the S4.  

 










I also chipped the '89 and added a K&N filter, who knows what the power is
now.  I would guess it went from 316 to somewhere around 385 to 400 on the
peak.  The Autothority claimed up to 20% on the peak on the S4, and K&N flows
45% more air to the engine.  Remember that this is not wheel power, but
engine power.  Reduce by about 15% to get wheel power.  

A couple of things that I do like on the '89 are the anti-lock brakes
(experiment in the rain so that you know how the car reacts to inputs when
the antilock is engaged), the trip computer, and the fog/driving lights (on
the '85 and '86 there are only fog lights in the front fascia). I also like
the wider stock wheels on the rear.  And in general I think the S4 and GT
have cleaner lines.

Even in stock form, how could you resist a simple mod like a filter, or chip?
I do agree to get the latest you can afford, but condition is everything.  I
would MUCH rather have a very nice '85, than  a marginal '87.  I was shopping
for the '86 and '87 when I found my current car, and would have been happy
spending several thousand less, but I looked for a long time and couldn't
find what I wanted in the older cars.

Good shopping, and remember there are many sites on the 'net that you can
shop from.
