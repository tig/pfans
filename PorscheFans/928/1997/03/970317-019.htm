Well, the spec book says that an '83 uses 19.7 l/100km on the EC
driving cycle, which I guess is something like suburban usage;
that's about 12 mpg US. So you seem to be way ahead of the game.
OTOH, at a constant 90 kph, it gets 24 mpg, which is not so
different from your results. (90 kph = 56 mph). The '84 is
supposed to do a little better at 90 kph (27 mpg), probably
because the aerodynamics is (are) a little better with the
spoilers. My car barely gets warmed up on my normal commute
run, especially in the winter, so it probably spends a lot of time 
running pretty rich. 

As the saying goes, your mileage may vary. Incidentally, I get
about 6 mpg on the track, including warmup and cooldown laps.
So who's complaining.

Whoa! If I wanted to write a book, I'd secure a contract! Seriously, that
is a great resource for the 924/944/968 people, but its way more than a
simple FAQ despite its name. If someone is willing to put that kind of work
into a FAQ for the 928 crowd, well you can count me in as a
researcher/contributer. You're right John, that is an excellent FAQ, and I
hope we could have one like that some day.

I like Berobi@aol.com (sorry, tough to guesss at the name) comments about
throwing out a topic or question to the group and collecting the responses
to form some material.

Putting the cart before the horse for a moment, we may want to produce an
HTML version and speak to Richard Ellis about linking to it from the
PorscheFans Web Site FAQ page (I wonder why the 924/944/968 FAQ isn't).
This wouldn't be instead of the mailable FAQ, rather it would be an
enhanced version with could easily include pictures.
