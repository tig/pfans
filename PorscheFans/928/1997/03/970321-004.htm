So your one of the people that bought porsches at govt auctions for only
$100.  I always wondered if there really were people that had.  But
seriously, how much was it, and how often do you see them at auctions.
 Assuming you frequent the government auctions enough to know.

That switch is either a rear hatch release of the fader for the stereo.  I
don't know about the older cars.  I think you probably have the fader there,
and didn't have a rear hatch release.  The headlight switch is on the left of
the instrument pod, top knob, turn to the right to operate.  If the Euro is
the same as the US, that is.  But there are plenty of Euro owners out there
to help.
