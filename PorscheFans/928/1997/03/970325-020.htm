I took my collapsible spare in to get a new valve and a once over at a tyre
shop. Not thinking I told the fellow the spare was in the back and to check
it out for me. Purely by chance I happened to wander over to the workshop
only to see him with my spare mounted in a vice and him tearing at it with a
lever trying to separate the rubber from the rim - I screamed "Nooooooo". I
managed to save the tyre before too much damage was done and the only thing
he said was - I've never seen a tyre go flat like THAT before.

Absolutely true story. :-)

I can understand a parrot mistaking a wall mirror for a whole other room but
you'd think he'd at least try to avoid the head-on collision with the other
bird...
