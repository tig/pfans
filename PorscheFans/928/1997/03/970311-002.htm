Does anyone know of any easy way to access the driving lights without the
high beams?  I was thinking of running new wiring and switching the positions
on the selector switch so that I could use the driving lights under normal
operation of the headlights rather than the fog lights.  I live in a rural
area and the extra light from the fog lights does not help much, but the
driving lights obviously would.  I don't mind using the high beam, but if I
didn't have to, then I wouldn't have to keep turning it off when other cars
approached.

I was also thinking of taking the wiring from the switch in the instrument
pod and running it to another switch that could allow me to differentiate the
two sets of lights, with the factory switch intact as an on off switch for
the differentiating switch. 

Any ideas, or veterans out there?

This is probably a stupid question to most of you, but I really need to 
know. My 928S has 193K on the odo and I can't tell whether the shock 
need replacing or not.  The car is not bouncy when driven and handle 
the same as the day that I got it; which is excellent.  What can I do 
to check the shock's condition further?
