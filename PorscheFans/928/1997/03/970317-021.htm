        For the past three weeks I have been looking into exhaust systems
for my 85' 928S Euro-spec. I have to replace everything from the convertor
on back.  I got a Borla cat-back system for 84-85 (US) 928s, but it wasn't
even close to being the right system. The bends in the dual-pipe tubing
were all wrong, and the dual pipes wouldn't fit as there was a space
constraint near the control arm. Anyway, so I sent that unit back. And I
opted to go the semi-custom route. I ordered a Borla Sportsman XR-1 16"
long, 3" diameter racing muffler, and lots of 3" stainless tubing (and one
of their 3" "intercooled" tips). I'm gonna get the tubing bent and
installed by a shop here.

Does anyone have any experience with a system like this ? (Borla Sportsman
XR-1, 3" diam., 16" long muffler, 3" tubing all the way from the cat), will
it perform well, also, I am worried about sound, since my model came with
two mufflers from the factory, and it is still rather loud.

Looking forward to your responses,

Paul Hatziiliades
