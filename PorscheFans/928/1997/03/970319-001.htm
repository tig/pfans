Hello all:

The 'balance pipe' or 'H-pipe' as it's commonly referred to was discovered
as a performance trick back in the '70's.  It was employed primarily on
header equipped, non-catalyst cars.  The optimum placement from the header
collector was where the paint stopped burning off - around 6 - 10 inches.

This trick was used by Ken Crumb also in the article that was
re-distributed awhile back on the list.  He noted a loss of torque due when
replacing his single cat with headers & dual exhausts.  Correctly surmised
that the cat was the common point and welded in an H-pipe thus restoring
performance.

Now then we're back to the original question - is the stock
dual-in/dual-out cat joined internally?  ie. a cat with simply dual
in/outlets  or is it actually two small cats joined together?  It is my
guess that if they were indeed separate, then an H-pipe would be
beneficial.  Yes, I do know the very close proximity of the head pipes but
have an idea for that - another vendor is offering pre-made X-pipes (notice
the join in the middle serving the same purpose as the H pipe).

Remember though, this is all speculation and we're left to our own devices
(read as independent dyno / track testing).

And to take full advantage of any change the stock computer programming
needs to be customized.  Leonard, feel free to jump in here any time!  If I
recall correctly his car doesn't employ just an off-the-shelf chip but a
tailor-made chip.

re: noise level
After giving this more thought, the car might not be objectionably loud
since the converter(s) are being retained - but it definately will be
louder than stock.  Also, the sound quality/tone will be different.  If the
XR1 can retain the same resonant qualities as stock, but just louder, it
could be a winning combo.  (If it sounds 'nasal' or 'hollow' then it's not
for me as I prefer lots of bass rumble)

Also, anyone know what a cat-bypass sounds like on a 32 valve motor?  Does
the '87 and later motors use tuned exhaust pipes or are they 'standard
issue' cast iron manifolds?  That's the biggest factor in quality of sound
I think...
Phil
