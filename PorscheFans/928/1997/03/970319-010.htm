Sorry if this sounds really daft, but plese bear with me. I have a 1984 928S 
Euro Model, and from what I hear it has a 4.7 litre engine right? When I do 
oil changes I put in almost 8 litres of oil. Does the 928 carry around an 
extra 3 litres of oil in the pan? It's just that my BMW has a 2.5 litre engine 
and it's filling capacity is 2.5 litres. This almost reminds me of a stock 
car. BTW 2nd gear at 3000 rpms kicks ass in this car. What is the reported top 
speed for this model? I had it up to 150mph in 5th and it was only at 4500 
rpms, still had lots more speed to give if you ask me, felt solid as a rock. 
Anyways any help would be appreciated.

Thanks, Jason Boettcher
