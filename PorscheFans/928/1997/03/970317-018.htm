Thanks. I was just in the owners manual and noticed what i need was
explained and pictured. Which local PCA do you belong to? I am in the
Potomac Region. Being out here for this 5 month school means i am missing a
lot. Looks like the weel of the annual Porsche Parade id the week i finish
up. Hope to run down there and catch what i can of it. Great motoring to you

I have a K&N filter, clean my plugs and injectors often, maintain 
proper tire pressure, regular oil changes and drives at 50-55 mph.  
(And probably terrain, elevation also makes a difference..)  I pamper 
my car.  Let me know if this is the norm.  If not, then that tells me 
that my odo is not correct!
