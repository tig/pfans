I recently obtained an '86 928, S model (66K) and immediately had to replace
the water pump.  When I removed the timing belt covers, I noted that the
index notches on the rear of the camshaft gears did not align with those on
the head, when the vibration balancer shaft is set to TDC.  The notches on
the gears were retarded approximately one tooth (counter-clockwise) from
those on the head.  The crankshaft would have to be rotated past TDC
(clockwise, of course!) to align the two marks.  

My question is this.... is there any logical reason why the cam timing would
be delayed?  It seemed to run OK, but since this is my first 928, I have no
frame of reference.  The belt was replaced apppx 15K miles ago, by a Porsche
dealership in Memphis.  Could this much delay be due to belt stretch?
Should I reinstall the belt and align the two as listed in the Workshop
Manual for the 32V engine?  Also, if I reinsall the belt and align the two
notches at TDC, how will this effect my ignition timing, since the rotor and
distributor are mounted on the camshaft gear?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.  I'm a newbie to this car and need all
the help I can get.  Thanks....   Mark
