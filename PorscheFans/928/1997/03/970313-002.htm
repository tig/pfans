You didn't get it.  I was NOT recommending him.  I was warning you that he
SUCKS.  He wants $85 plus shipping for what my dealer will sell me for $32
(ALMOST THREE TIMES AS MUCH) and no charge to mail it.  He then told me that
I couldn't get it from my dealer.  But many of you, some who suggested I
visit the dealer, know that you can clearly purchase the manuals for the
dealer.  

Don't bother with him, call your dealer.  Or call Devek, or call Performance,
or call Automotion, or probably many other shops.  Or call my dealer, (804)
270-9000, Hawthorne Imports in Richmond, Virginia.  He's mailing it to me
because I live 60 miles away, but the cost of first class mail is the same
everywhere in the states, so just call them.  I ordered today, and if you
call today your order will be ready in about a week.  The microfiche only
covers 'till late '91 model year, and he told me there are no updates
announced yet.  But give it time.  Besides your car probably is older than
that anyway.  

Good Luck,

BR

Oh!  What was I thinking about?  Thanks for straightening me out!  I've 
placed an order from DEVEK last November and they told me that there 
won't be any stock until June.  I can't wait that long!  Seriously 
thinking of getting the fische version, but not sure about getting the 
viewer.  I'll think a little more on this...
