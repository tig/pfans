Brian,
  The seat has a manual override, I think it is an allen socket, but if the 
track is stuck all you will end up doing is breaking the plastic gears. I dont 
know if the track is a worm type gear or what, but I do remember that I 
couldn't get it out without moving the seat all the way back to get at the 
front bolts, and all the way forward to get at the rear bolts. My plastic gear 
was 1/3 stripped, so this process took about an hour. The only other advice I 
can give you is to check under the seat and make sure that nothing is broken 
or wedged in there, and if that doesn't work, try to get the seat out. 

Good Luck, let me know how it goes.
