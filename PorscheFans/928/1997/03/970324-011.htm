Debra - the fuse for the headlight motor is NOT the same as the one
for the headlights themselves, OK? Bad assumption. 

The second possibility is the lower left relay on the same panel
that has the fuses. Unfortunately, it's probably expensive,
unless you can borrow one to try it out.

And the Chilton manual has not got a wiring diagram. It does
actually have some useful information, especially for early
928's, but not that particular bit.
