Dave, one last question.  You mentioned that a very patient
do-it-yourselfer could do this repair; I'm pretty good with tools and
have done most work on all my own cars except for the 928.  If I get a
set of factory repair manuals, would they walk me through the procedures
in detail?  I'm a mechanical engineer by trade and can figure out most
things, but this car presents more of a challenge than I am used to, so
I have had most work done by a good local mechanic.  But the prospect of
a bill for 16+ hours of labor has me thinking it might be time to give
this a try.

I'm afraid that if I can't do this myself, the memory of this repair
bill will last even until 2007 :)
