Good day 928 Fans,

I've been reading every posting to this mailing list now for about 5 months
and have learned an enormous amount about my car. I've even posted the odd
response or two although, like many, I'm still on the steep part of the
learning curve! I've noticed the number of new people joining the list is
increasing almost daily. The questions often asked of newcomers are
invariably similar. This isn't too surprising - this is the best "place" to
be if you have just purchased a 928, or are planning or pondering a purchase.

I wonder if we shouldn't write a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list and
post it regularly to the group - perhaps the first of each month so the
newest version could always be easily found in the archives. I say version
because good FAQ's are always undergoing continuous improvements and are
never really completed.

What may well be a good approach is for everyone to choose a task or topic
for contribution. For example, someone could take the topic of
"Specifications" and provide the editor with all pertinent specs of all the
years for both the US and Euro models. Someone else could take "Information
Sources" and provide a comprehensive list of manufacturers of aftermarket
parts, recycle shops, book titles, POC information, etc. "Common Problems"
- what are the most common failures, are there any "weak" points to look
out for. You get the idea.

The "raw data" doesn't have to be pretty. The editors job will be to put it
all into a logical, readable form. And although its nice to have some
degree of detail, we probably want to stay away from overkill - no
trouble-shooting section!

If anyone enjoys writing this type of document and could set aside the time
to do it please speak up. If not, I would volunteer my services as editor
if others could contribute the material.
