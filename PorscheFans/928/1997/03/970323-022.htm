I'm pretty satisfied with the sound of the Blaupunct RenoII (which is
the third one in this car).  So I'm thinking about installing one of
those RF CD changers.  I hate the idea of putting it all the way in the
back though.  Sounds like a hellofa long wiring job, but really there
aren't many options.  I like the Idea of mounting it in front of the
right rear passenger seat.  It's out of the sun and out of sight down
there.   I guess I should find a changer and get its dimensions first.
