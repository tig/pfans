>      Hi,
>         Would anybody be able to help me out with the following
info/parts 
>      which would apply to a 1986 S:

A good year!  Is the car AT or 5 speed?

>       1) Advice on how to re-stretch leather over cardboard panels at
rear 
>      side windows.

Cardboard warped from heat, probably ruined, very common.  In the
beginning, I used to think it was intentional for venting or something! 
Don't know any procedure to repair (cut out underlying piece and replace?).
 See a very good upholstery shop, like Sid's who just did an interior tech
session for PCA.  Not wanting to incur the expense or possibly ruining the
interior further, I just tinted my windows.


>       2) One front speaker (the larger one of the two) for the door.

The four inch driver can be easily replaced.  UNSCREW the mesh cover
(thanks Leonard!).  Note that the smaller mid/tweet is wired in-line with a
capacitor.  Don't bypass it or you'll fry that smaller driver at high
volume.

>       3) One headlamp squirter nozzle.

928.528.071.02.03C

>       4) One windscreen wiper nut plastic cover.

Gotta buy the whole arm.  
L arm  928.628.213.06
R arm  928.628.213.05

>       5) One perfect leather (maroon-ish) gear shift knob.
>       6) One Sony CDX-A55 Multi-changer. (have XR-A55 Radio/tape)
>       7) One fader knob next to driver's seat.

Couldn't find no's for these.  Sure you can get them new or from
dealers/salvage shops.


>       8) One rear hatch release knob.

928.613.123.05

>       9) I'm sure I've forgotten lots more stupid small bits...

excellence (pun intended)  is sweating the details!   Many vendors to help
you, in no particular order:  authorized Porsche dealer, Automotion,
Performance Products, Devek Performance, 928 International, PCA, etc.  

I have found the members of this list to be a tireless source of help and
enthusiam.  And try to do my best in appreciation.  Tip:  Don't post to
more than one list at a time or risk spamming everyone!

Yes!
