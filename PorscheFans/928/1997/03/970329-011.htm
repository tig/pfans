Well, just want the folks to no where I am...

Most of the "stuff" is off and I encountered a few surprises.

The biggest one is from the tensionner.  I was advise that on
a car with only 71,000 miles, I would not have to rebuild the thing.
Well, this was a bad advice for my situation.  The rubber boot on the
tensionner was completely dried up and I require a new one.  Of course
I was able to find one bu forgot to ask for the ring to hold
the cap in place...

My crankshaft is still sitting at 45 BTDC as this is suppose to be
the "safe" position where you can turn the camshaft without damaging
the valve.  However, are the camshaft suppose to be easy to turn?
mine are real hard to turn and I am hoping that it is due to the 
valve spring resistance (please confirm this if you know)

My last problem is the how to remove the harmonic balancer.  I am
planning to use a gear puller but anyt advice will be apreciated.

I will try to keep you posted,
