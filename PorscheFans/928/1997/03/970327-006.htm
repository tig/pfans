|All S4 and GT cars ('87-'91 in the US, '92 elsewhere) are supposed to run
|36/44. The GTS ('92+) went to 17" wheels and 36/36 tire pressures. Don't

This does ALL depend on what you are doing with the car. My GTS with the tyre
pressure sensors requires at least 38psi all round (when cold) to not show a
tyre pressure low alarm. For autocrossing you NEED to run much lower pressures
in the rear otherwise you will understeer severely. Safety requires street cars
to understeer (a lot!) to be safe for Mr. Average Driver. This is probably why
some models required more air in the rear. For the street I beleive it really
all depends how you drive. Check your alignment and check wear. If the alignment
is good then adjust the tyre pressures for even tyre wear. My first set of
tyres with stock alignment lasted 4500 miles but perhaps I am a little more
agressive than average ;-)

This is where we get YMMV..

Why does some people thinks that Porsche owners are FILTHY RICH?  
Sounds like this guy need to find a job!  Or at least do what I did; 
stand on a freeway exit with a sign: "Homeless Computer Consultant.  
Will program C++, JAVA, PL/SQL for food.  God bless!"

I'm toying with the idea of swapping out my '83 5-speed with an '86+ 
transmission.  Is this possible?  Care to share any experience or 
comments on this?
