This happened to me and I took the whole gear assy. apart, then took the seat 
out ( without power it's a pain in the ass ). After all that work I found out 
that the electrical plug under the seat pulled out of it's mating connector, 
because a CD was under there. It wasn't a total waste of time though, I found 
about a buck-three-ninety-five in change under the seat.
