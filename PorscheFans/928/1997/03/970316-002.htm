I hope to become a 928 owner in the very near future and have my eye on a 
1980 928 with 82k. The guy who owns it has no idea of what he has and 
bought it "cause it looked good". He has been no help as to the history 
of the car. The last records he has stopped with a tuneup and door lock 
replacement in 1995. A large gap from '87 to the last entry in '95. If 
anyone has any tips on what to look for that may be specific to the 
928 I would be very much appreciate the knowledge.

I have been hearing horror stories on the parts and maintenance costs for 
the 928. This part of being a Porsche owner has me concerned. 

This car is a dream to drive and although it is not near the top of the 
performance list of newer models I'm thinking it can deliver a spanking 
to the '92 Mustang 5.0 (stock) my buddy drives.
