Sorry for the long post but I am going through my newly acquired 1980 928S 
(Euro spec) RHD and have some questions that I hope the members of this 
Digest can assist me with.

The clutch master cylinder leaks and squirts a tiny jet of brake fluid through 
the rubber boot and into the footwell area.

  I've just ordered the clutch master cylinder for my '83, since it's been 
  leaking in my footwell. (if you're ever looking for something to remove the 
  color from leather shoes....). It's well known that replacing it is a huge 
  pain since it's nearly impossible to get to. A tip I received from 928 
  International is that rarely is the iron cylinder scored, but rather the 
  aluminum piston is scored or the seals are shot. This opens up the possibility 
  of 'rebuilding' it from inside the footwell. 928 International tells me that 
  the piston can be removed and inspected from inside the footwell. If the 
  scoring is not on the inside of the iron cylinder, then just replace the guts 
  from the new master cylinder into the old iron housing of the old master 
  cylinder. This is much easier than trying to remove the whole thing from 
  inside the engine compartment.
