Alright, this is getting ridiculous. I think my subconscious is trying
to tell me someting.

I've been patiently saving up for a 928, silver on op-art cloth, egg
poacher wheels (was looking at '80, but after reading the list for many
weeks now, am now thinking about '86 on...thanks, Phil) but now I am
considering just getting a quick loan and getting it over with. I am now
having 928 dreams!

A mint condition (of course) British racing green w/tan interior
spoilerless beauty was sitting on a grassy noll with the keys inside. !.
It being dark and quiet out and no dream police in sight, I decided to
take it for a test drive. (Wouldn't you?)

The car dutifully rocketed me around a circular parkway, rushing the
scenery by. I watched the cobra head street lights shoot up the
mirror-like finish of the hood, past the beautiful Porsche crest
emblem.  The feel, the sound, the controls were all that I had imagined
since I first glimpsed the car on magazine pages as an 11-year-old boy.
Being an anal sort, I was happy to find that the circular parkway made
it easy to locate the spot where I'd first found the car. The tricky
part was positioning the tires over the depressions it had made in the
grass while at rest. :-)

When I woke, I felt as if I had actually driven a 928.

Is there a cure for this disease?
