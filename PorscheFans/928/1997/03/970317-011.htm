I would guess that this happens with some of the other engines as well.  When
my car sits for several days (as little as 3 or 4), it blows a little
(sometimes more) smoke and then settles down.  I knew oil was leaking down
from somewhere and I would guess that this is the place.   I have had
identical experiences with my '85 and '89.  It dosen't always happen, and now
I will have to remember how I was driving the car last before parking it.
 Just today I started the car after 4 days of sitting, and no smoke.  But my
mother was visiting and on the last ride home we drove moderately.  No high
RPM's means less oil right?

Oh well, I guess I will have something else to watch for and see if I can
find the correlation.
