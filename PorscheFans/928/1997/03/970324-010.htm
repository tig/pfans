Thanks to everyone who responded to my question about my headlight
problems and the mystery switch on 3/20. I still have not gotten around to
checking everything out, but assume its not the fuse as the headlights
themselves work. I have a copy of this page from an '81 from the Mitchell
wiring diagrams available in my local library, but didn't know that the
Chilton manual had a wiring diagram. Guess I'll actually have to think
harder about ordering this from the auto parts store as I haven't been
able to find a used one anywhere.
For those of you who thought it might be the speaker switch, the car also
has that, although it is disconnected.
As one person commented on their ignition switch being a little quirky
and causing them problems with their headlights, this is a possibility as
my ignition switch is also not quite right.
No, this wasn't one of those $100 auction cars you see the ads for. I paid
$5500. The car has 71K miles. I was able to find out the paint job
(black) was only a few years old and some of the interior had been
replaced at that time also (due to vandalism). The car has the leather
interior with the power seats.
The car was already licensed in my state (WA) but just had to be renewed.
Obviously somebody went to some trouble when they brought the car here
from Germany. The car is equipped with a catalytic converter. Fortunately,
my county doesn't require emissions testing yet.
Thanks again for all the info.
