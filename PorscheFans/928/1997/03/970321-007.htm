Well...I was wrong again. "Spread the ignorance." That's what I always say ;-)

Thanks, John White. 

BTW, about that stereo repair: 

Matt Carpenter provided all the info I needed to debug my stereo problems.
Thanks, Matt. Now, please don't get mad at me because I yanked the M494
Blaupunkt Booster. As Matt presumed (and I confer) the original head (MIA
via PO) must have been sending a non-amplified signal to the booster. I
tried hooking up the preamp out from the current Jenson, but this provided
no usable signal whatsoever. I also tried using the speaker out as the input
to the booster, but the impedence mismatch was horrible! So, I dug out an
old Tancredi (what!) EQ/Booster, something I've Sanford'ed since 1981, and
hooked it up. I ran the stock rear speakers in parallel with some Jenson
decklid enclosures for rear sound and the stock door units for front sound.
Yes, a 4 ohm load on the rear and an 8 ohm load up front. Oy vey! 

The next delimma was where to mount the EQ. Guess what? There is _no_ good
place for an EQ. I took out the ash tray and considered Rube Golberg'ing the
ash tray cover to hide the EQ. Nah. I'm not destroying the stock ashtray just
to use its lid. Besides, the EQ was just a little too big for that location.
Package tray on the drivers side was too shallow. Package tray on the passenger
side was too far away from driver access. So I sat in the car and very
carefully tweeked the EQ for a while and put it where the M494 was. Yes, it's
completely inaccessible, but the installation is very clean and by setting the
EQ while the head was set to flat, I can fine tune a nice loudness curve with
just the bass and treble of the head.

The whole setup sounds worlds better than ever. And I didn't pay an additional
dime to realize this. Good thing I'm a "horder".
