I=A0have the same experience on my 86.&nbsp; It only happens when the fan
speed is set to the lowest position, usually when I am sitting in traffic
and therefore there is little airflow through the climate control.&nbsp;
It also only happens when it is either very cold or very warm outside.&nb=
sp;
I=A0always assumed that the climate control cannot provide enough hot or
cold air at the lowest setting when the outside temperature is very diffe=
rent
from inside, therefore it does these quick blasts of high fan speed to
try to get to the selected inside temperature.&nbsp; I have no technical
evidence to back this up.&nbsp; Does anybody else?

<BR><I>&gt;&gt;The cruise control doesn't work. Sometimes is feels that i=

Another possibility is a vacuum leak somewhere under the dash in the cons=
ole.&nbsp;
I=A0have had cruise control problems that were caused by vacuum leaks, th=
at
also affexted the heating system.&nbsp; The cruise control would work onl=
y
if the heater was on, or I=A0would get a whistling sound that went away w=
hen
the A/C was turned on.&nbsp; My mechanic usually traced these leaks down
, but it is a time consuming process.&nbsp; From the climate control and
cruise control issues, I=A0would suspect vacuum problems.

Have you test the temperature sensor to see if it's wacko?

=====================
This weekend I flushed out my cooling system, and replaced
the thermostat. The old thermostat appeared fine, and there
seemed to be little corrosion in the system as a whole.

After removing the original thermostat I ran the engine
for a while with NO thermostat, and still found it to be
run at 3/4 on the temp gauge. Too hot for my tastes. It used
to rest happiky at 1/2.

After reassembling with the thermostat in place still no change.

The hoses seem fine, no noticable problems there. 

Oddly though the velocity of water leaving the drain hole 
on the bottom of the radiator, the as well as the feeder hose
and outlet port doesn't seem to change with RPM. 

I guess the next thing to check is the pump. 

Can anyone recommend a good source for the service manual
for this car? I'm getting in way above what my geek head can
handle.

Any suggestions/help is greatly appreciated.

TIA,

Lance
