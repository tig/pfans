Nope - I have the flat European lead crystal lenses that have a distinct
cut-off pattern so as not to blind oncoming drivers.  They are very
distinctive looking lights on or off and obviously not standard US spec. 
My only objection is that they are not the full 8" lens like everyone
wants, but are 7" lens so the chrome retaining rings are still used.  The
pair was under $100 though vs. the $375 for the big Bosche's!!!  The
90/130's were like $15 each I think.  Get some!!!

I love the output, especially with the highs!!!  HUGE difference for
night-time banzai run safety - one never can have enough candlepower at
140+ mph.  Speaking of which, I notice no undue alternator strain hi or low
setting, these are pretty efficient bulbs (rated by mfr that it draws no
more than 80w bulbtype).

ps.  Man oh man would I love a ZX-11 !!!  I used to ride a '92 ZX-6 to work
everyday, I love Kawasaki's
