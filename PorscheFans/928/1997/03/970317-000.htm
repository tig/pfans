Hi Mike!

Welcome to the list!  Where are you located?  Here are some general ideas
for  parts (in no particular order):

Automotion  1-800-777-8881
Devek Performance  1-800-598-0693
EASY (European Auto Salvage Yard) 510-653-EASY
Parts Heaven  1-800-767-7250
Performance Products  1-800-789-1879
928 International  714-632-9288

There are tons of other sources in excellence magazine - highly recommended
you pick up a copy.  Good idea to join the Porsche Club of America also,
member benefits include a subscription to Panorama magazine, sponsored
driving events & tech sessions, etc.  

I have a US model '84 928S with AT and my mpg varies wildly depending on
city vs. highway (also I live in S.F. very hilly and many stoplight drags
if you know what I mean ;)  so my low is around 10mpg and the high around
16 or so, mixed usage.

Looking forward to hearing more details about your 928 (what color? 
checkerboard interior?  do you have the single or dual rear fog lights?),
Phil
