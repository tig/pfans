Second for me as well.  My other was an '85 S.  I used to live in Oregon and
come home at about 120-145 regularly.  Here in Virginia I have only topped
135 once.  86K on the car.  The transmission level can be checked at a Jiffy
lube or whatever you have out there.  

The transmission service (filter, etc..) should be about $75 including parts
and labor.  Then you wont generally have to worry again, unless you see fluid
in the driveway.
