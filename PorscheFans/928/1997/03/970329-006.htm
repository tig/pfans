 Automotion claims that this spring package will fix this characteristic.  It has been my ex

Crumb at the Zone 1 Tech tactics, so perhaps i can shed a tad of insight.  If i remember correctly Kim 
designed these springs together with Eibach, and later handed the package over to Automotion.  According to 
him the springs are better than stock over small bumps, and stiffer over large bumps due to their progressive 
design.  As an example of the difference this makes on the track, Kim told me that on a track like Lime 
Rock,CT(only one i've been on so far), the Automotion/Koni combination along with the RIGHT(he stressed this) 
alignment will make a TWO SECOND difference.  Those of us who have been on the track  realize these are huge 
numbers.  Also, Kim mentioned that Automotion has the numbers to be used with the spring package, so they're 
probably another good place to call for specs on different wheel fitments.  The other thing to worry about 
using these springs is that now that your approx. an inch lower, that front spoiler's going to be playing 
some un-welcome tunes.

   ** Another satisfied customer.  I've had the chips in almost from day one, and am only sorry i did not at 
least take some before and after in-gear accel numbers to backup my seat-of-the-pants assessment.
