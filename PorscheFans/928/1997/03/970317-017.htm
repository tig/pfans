I think it would be a good idea to try to include a sort of comparison at 
the end of the FAQ to different porsches (an open minded one!!). For 
instance, somebody who does not know anything about 911s or 944 turbos but 
were wondering what car they should buy could look at the comparison and 
it would help them make up there mind. For instance, one small open minded 
comparison between the 928 and the 944 turbo S is that the 928 is more 
comfortable on the inside - yet it can also be mentioned that the 944 is 
lighter and has better steering, and less body roll, yet sacrifices some 
ride comfort. I personally think this would help the novice decide what 
car they really want to own (even a devil's advocate against the 928 could 
be good also, perhaps as a reality check to those who might not know what 
they are getting into).
