I've changed my timing belt twice already and in both instances, 
tension it using the quarter-turn method; then make slight adjustments 
within a few hundred miles.  You are definitely right about the engine 
growling if it is too tight.  Have anyone tried using a tensioning tool 
aside from Porsche's?

Also, a piece of advice, check the rubber cap on the thermostatic 
tensioner.  If it feels like hard plastic, change it soon.  Mine failed 
while I was driving.  Not fun...

When you get a chance, remove the driver-side cam gear housing, the one 
directly behind the cam year along with the distributor.  Behind  it, 
you'll find an oil galley about the size of a dime as well as a small 
neoprene washer.  This washer tends to shrink over time and therefore 
loses it's sealing property.  I bet that's where the majority of your 
oil leak comes from.  Reinstall using a good quality sealant.  
Apparently Porsche does not use any type of sealant on the mating 
surface.  It took me almost two years to figure this one out.
