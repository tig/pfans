Relay to Message 0013 Re: 928 Digest for 9 Mar 1997

Hi John's, it's funny how the 928's all have the same problem.  My
87'Stick had the same problems with the Automatic Climate Control and
the Cruise Control.  The local Porsche garage found out that the sliding
contacts in the Climate Control unit (you 'll see a lot of copper
contacts via the sliding slots) were not making good contacts, thus
causing the hot air.  I don't get any hot air (especially with summer
coming), but I'm still having problems with my A/C.  I only wish there
was a manual override for all the fancy stuff.  The Automatic Climate
Control unit is pretty expensive.  Something like $700 (what my mechanic
quoted me).

As for the Cruise Control.  After looking around the engine bay trying
to figure out what's what.  I found a thin (3/8 inch) plastic hose on
the drive side toward the fireall (vacume hose I assume) that was
loose.  After connecting it, my Cruise Control worked fine.  But, it
kept on coming loose after driving it until I rerouted the hose.  It's
fine now.
