This is something that seems to happen if you pull high RPMs with the '85
(and perhaps other) 928s. Oil is sucked up into the intake runners.

During prepurchase inspection on my '85, the prospective buyer's mechanic
found nearly a pint, between the two sides... he was puzzled, but it didn't
stop the sale, happily enough.

Since then, I've heard from a few sources that this doesn't indicate a
problem. But I'd sure hate for a glob of oil to get sucked into a
combustion chamber...
