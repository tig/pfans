Scott, that's a good idea but just like every thing on a 928, the fuel pump
does not SUCK, at leaset no much, it pushes much better than it sucks.
Although the tank is plastic it is much to stiff to  be cavatated by the
fuel pump.  I have incountered the same problem with two of the six 928's
that I am currently rebuilding.  The problem is that the breather tube
(braded rubber and pre-formed) goes from the top right side of the gas tank
straight to the rear for about 6 inches then makes a 90 degree turn through
the frame, the hole is just big enough for the hose, then makes a larger
radius 90 degree turn back to the top back side of the filler neck.  I am
sure you can see that if during installation the tub gets kenked of is not
connected to the filler neck and gets clogged with mud, the tank will trap
air when the gas gets just above the point where the filler neck goes into
the tank.  That takes between 11 to 12 gal depending on how level the car
is.  Hope this helps.

  BTW if you didn't know this tube was there when trying to remove a tank,
you stand a good chance of breaking the nippel off of the top of the tank
and/or the filler neck.  If you are luckey and can find a tank at a junk
yard the lesson will only cost about $250.
