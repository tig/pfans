The most developed kits whether single fogger or direct port are going to
be for the biggest market - American V8's.  From those spring all kinds of
applications from Acura's to Zagatos - in other words, you're pretty much
on your own.   I admit to daydreaming of NOS'g the 928 (heck the kit is
cheap enough) but my car has too many miles.  So I placed an order for my
Miata but the vendor who shall remain Saintless, oops!,  nameless failed to
ship so I canceled the order and have no first hand experience to share.

There was someone on this list that had a single fogger setup and
eventually a thrown rod or something and thus the caveat to go light on the
jets especially on a stock motor.  For example, you could use a 150 - 200hp
kit on a Chevy V8.  While I'm sure a fresh, stock 928 motor could handle
that type of increase, I still wouldn't jet that heavy for the sake of
durability.

If you are really interested in more info on this application, you should
contact Nitrous Oxide Systems direct - I'm sure they would go nuts over
designing a system for you!

Careful!
Phil
