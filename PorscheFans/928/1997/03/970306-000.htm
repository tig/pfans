Just my $0.02 but you could take the wheel off and either put it in
a water tub or put some soapy water on it to detect where the leak
comes from.  It could be that you have a defective stem or valve...
In anycase, it probably would be usefull to know where the leak is 
occuring.

Also, is it possible that the rims are too wide for the tires??
