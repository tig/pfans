I'm looking for answers to questions I have regarding the exterior
lighting on my 1978 Euro 928. Looks like the PO may have mixed up some
of the lenses (and wires!) on the front of the car. I have them all out
of the car in preparation for painting (the car, not the lights) and
would like to put them back in the correct locations (and find all the
wiring bugaboos).

Of the two lights on the front of the car (per side, ignoring the large
pop-up and the turning signal), which is the fog light and which is the
parking light? Both have the same halogen bulb, one also has a very
small incandescent bulb and a partial "guard" over the halogen. One has
a clear plastic lens under the glass one. Which is which, when are each
supposed to light, which one is supposed to have the extra lens, and
where are they supposed to be located (fog lights towards the center of
the car or outside).

To further confuse things which bulb is the "parking light" and is this
the same one that is referred to in the Tech. Spec. book as the
"secondary headlight".

Anybody care to "enlighten" me? (sorry, couldn't resist...)
