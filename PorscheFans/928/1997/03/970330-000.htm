I just did the same procedure on one of my company wagons and will compare
notes:

Ditto, same color as really dirty oil...

The MityVac manual indicated that small bubbles are indicative of air
'leaking' in around the bleeder threads and this poses no problem to brake
operation as the bubbles are introduced after the lines.

In any event, I had this 'infinate' air occurance also but will distinguish
the two types I observed:

a-  large air 'gaps' in line from bleeder to MityVac as fluid fills under
vacuum.  Obviously normal operation (no fluid in there to begin with, only
air under vacuum)

b-  after filling the MityVac container, the fluid looked like a dark,
stout beer with a head of tiny foamy like bubbles.  These could either be
the leaky bleeder bubbles, or, were created as the fluid passes through the
MityVac cap to be collected in the container.  I drained the container
three/four times per wheel until the fluid that bled out was fairly clear
like an ale.  It never got 'bubble-less' though.  FWIW, while bleeding I
never let the MityVac get under 10 bar to hopefully guarantee I didn't
introduce any air into the system during pauses in bleeding.

Was it actually still bleeding fluid, or, was the fluid already in the
clear MV line settling? 

Some suggestions:

a- don't overtighten/torque the bleeder valve, it might break off or strip
b- maybe you should try using a tighter fitting MityVac bleeder adapter
c- double & triple check all brake components before roadtest
d- start the car, pump the brakes numerous times, hold to bottom, etc. then
check for leaks before driving off
e-  check again, especially master cylinder level, regularly

Let us know how the job turns out,
