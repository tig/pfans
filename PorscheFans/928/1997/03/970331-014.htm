>>>  Could someone give me some information on the use of spacers on the

>>>  
>>>    a) which year did the factory start installing them?
>>
>>17 mm spacers appeared on the rear wheels of the 928 S4 Club Sport (a
>>preview of the GT, probably nonexistent in the US) in '88 and the 928 GT in
>>'89. They stayed with the GT through its production run and appeared on the
>>GTS as well.
>>
>>>    d) when upgrading an early S model (I have an '83 US spec) to 
>>>       the S4 16x8 rear wheels, are spacers still used (or needed)?
>>
>>No. Apart from the phantom Club Sport model mentioned above, no S4 came
>>with spacers.
>>
>>The front and rear wheels which came with your '83 928 S (pedant alert:
>>note the space between the "8" and the "S") are 7" wide and have an offset
>>of 60 mm (same dimensions for the S4 front wheels).
>>
>>The S4 rear wheels are 8" wide and have an offset of 52.3 mm, which is 12.7
>>mm or 1/2" less than the S wheel, so the center of the tread will be in the

I partly disagree about the spacers. The parts book shows a 21 mm spacer on
the rear for 78-88 cars (which is all it covers). However, it also
shows two lengths of wheel bolt, 50 and 72 mm, depending on whether
the spacer is there. FWIW, my car has the spacer. So I think the
answer is, if you have the spacer, keep it.

Second point: the offset is the spacing between the centerline of the
tire and the mounting plane, right? So the smaller offset of the
8" wheel will move the centerline of the tire about 1/2" to the
outside. Consequently, the inside of the tire stays in the same
place, and the outside moves out by one inch, to my thinking.
Which raises the question of clearance on the outside, which looks
kind of marginal. So maybe the spacer has to go after all? That
would mean purchasing and installing 10 new wheel bolts, though.

It would be nice to get this right. Any insights welcome. Nice
pedantic point about the space between 928 and S, Leonard, by
the way. Incidentally the offset in the 7" wheels is 65 mm; 
I think you knew that but just mis-typed it.
