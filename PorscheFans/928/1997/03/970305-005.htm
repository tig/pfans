     If you are adding wider tires, yes this will help. The stickier the 
     tire you mount on them will also help a lot.

     I already had ABS, so I have no idea what it takes to add this to your 
     car. I am sure a call to Devek can answer this one.

     I think this is old thinking, as far as the ABS and racers goes. From 
     what I remember reading a long time ago was that racers hated them at 
     first and then learned to love them. Not being a pro, I am not sure 
     the current thinking. I do know that I like them though :-)
