	I just looked at the 928 pictures on the Porsche Fans Page. The same three 
cars have been there forever! C'mon guys (& girls) the 944 and 911 photo pages 
have tons of pictures. Besides, ever since I was a kid I associated people 
with their cars. I want to see your cars! I love 928's!!!! Just ask 
Phil Tong, I am a total car nut, and 928's are at the top of my list. I will 
try to figure out how to post a picture and do it ASAP. If you have noticed 
the 911 crowd (so-called purists?! (soon to be water cooled)) sticks together 
and so does the water pumper 924/944/968 crowd. We are on our own, let's show 
them, and eachother, the cars we love and love(?) to work on! If you love your 
car as much as I do you will be so happy you did it!

	You will see my car soon!
