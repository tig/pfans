I have to agree on the hot side of 'all conditions' anyway. I had my '85
928S (32V US) in Riyadh Saudi Arabia and never had a temp problem with it at
all. I had a little thermometer in it which died one day - its last words
were 70C - (parked in the sun of course). I really couldn't fault the
'high-heat' performance of the car and the A/C kept the interior quite nice
without bothering the engine temp. There were really only aggressive
maintenance schedules for extreme heat and dust (2K mile change oil/filters
etc) to keep on top of.

        The only temperature mod which the Porsche Doctor did for me was to
'lock open' the slats at the front of the radiator as he said they were for
extreme cold weather driving and too risky in a place like Riyadh. He
reckoned he'd seen them fail in the closed position and cause vehicles to
overheat - this was all I needed to hear and so I let him do it without
argument (in fact I think I agreed to everything he ever suggested -
ka-ching $$$$$$). 

Any thoughts on locking open the slats or anybody have other 'temperature mods'?

I can understand a parrot mistaking a wall mirror for a whole other room but
you'd think he'd at least try to avoid the head-on collision with the other
bird...
