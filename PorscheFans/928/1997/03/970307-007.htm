If the wheels are otherwise stock, then they have anodizing.  I have used a
0000 steel wool pad along with Mother's to remove tough stains.  Are you sure
the wheels are polished, or are they factory anodized?  You can remove the
anodizing and polish them to a mirror finish in about 1-2 hours each.

Call Dave at BrightWorks to order supplies, use Easy Off to remove
annodizing.  I just ordered my supplies and even with a greasless abrasive
(to remove some light scratches), the total will only be about $30.00 for
enough to do more than four wheels.
