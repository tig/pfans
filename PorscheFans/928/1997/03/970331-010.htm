Sorry for the weird subject line. My wife has put her foot down and told
me that I can only keep one Porsche, so the '86 928S is gonna stay and
the 944 is going. I'm starting to get serious about fixing some of the
little things on the 928 which have bugged me over the last year but I
never got time to work on. One of them is the leather covering on the
two curved pieces directly below the left and right rear side windows...
you know the ones that hold the rear speakers. I call 'em "bolsters" but
that's probably not the right name. For some reason the leather on one
side has broken loose from under the curved bolster and looks bad. The
other one has warped a little and from outside the car you can see the
sound insulation under it. I was going to fix this but darned if I can't
see how to get the buggers out. I don't have a shop manual (yet) so I'm
hoping someone has done this, or at least will tell me it can be done
without a cutting torch and a set of rosary beads. Any experience
removing these bolsters?

TIA
