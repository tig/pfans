A goodie!

NO center jackpoint!  Also do NOT jack/support car by the faux 'frame
rails', they will bend immediately!  Without a true shop lift you will need
to jack each corner separately.  There are jack points at each corner, have
a look under there...

Automotion might have some sport springs left in their 'garage sale'...  I
think they are Eibachs 450lb progressive fronts / 270 lbs rear but pop over
to the webpage and check it out.  Pretty good deal too at $299 for the set.
 Call soon cuz when they're gone, they're GONE

There are alot of vendors but a couple of 928-specifc fav's are Devek
Performance 1-800-598-0693 and 928 Int'l 1-714-632-9288.  Seeing is
believing and I'm lucky enough to live close by to Devek Performance - are
you prepared for this - they can make your car a 6 liter 928 S4!!!   They
just blueprinted my friend's '85 5-liter and man that car hauls the way it
is.

Funny you should mention this... we're (928fans) trying to get this going
(check those archives) to put our  collective experience and knowledge
(check those archives!) together to keep the 928 where it belongs - on the
roads and tracks!  Someone posted a draft 'outline' based on the 944 FAQ
and it looks good to me.  

How about we get started 928fans???
