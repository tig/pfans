Actually it carries the whole 8 liters in the pan when it's not running.
You got it right, it really does take that much oil.

The top speed is for the US model is 146 mph, according to the factory.
Which is 4500 rpm in 5th, with the US gears. The Euro cars have more
power, and different gears (2.72 for the Euro, 2.27 for the US). You
should have been turning about 5500 at a true 150 mph, unless you
have a US transaxle in a Euro car. Speedometers lie anyway.
You probably didn't have much left, but at that speed,
who cares? It was apparently the fastest production car in the world
when it was built.
