Hi, I have a '79 928 w/71k mileage that I picked up at a government
seizure auction about 2 months ago. The car does not have the rubber
bumper pads and the dash warnings are in German. Since it was an
auction car, I don't have any real history. (Had decided
on a last style MR2 but a 911 or 928 was also under consideration). 
Anyway, the headlights don't
automatically retract/raise. Yes I know I can do it by hand, but am
wondering just where to start troubleshooting the problem. I have a switch
with a headlight emblem on the floor between the driver's seat and the
door sill which appears to be vacuum operated. This switch is not covered
in the owner's manual I bought (from Automotion). 
I know there are Euro and US style cars, but just what are the differences
besides engine HP. One book I read at the library said driving lights are
used as headlights in Europe, is that why my car is different?
