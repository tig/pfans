Does anyone know or kow how to find out how many 928's were eventually
produced? I am especially interested in the numbers of the GTS.

The only information I have got (in brackets my source of information):

Total 928:  61,000 (up to 1/7/96; 911 & Porsche World)

1995:	312 (Christophorus 1/96)
1996: 28 (Christophorus 1/97)

By the way - any chance of getting a facility to search the Porsche Fans
Archives by subject or is there another way to do this?

I'm in the process of doing some restoration and it has been sitting in 
the garage the past 6 months.  But prior to that, I put in about 160 
miles per work day for awhile and change oil once a month.  I replaced 
the ORIGINAL Bosch starter at 186K.
(hint: depress your clutch while starting the car.  This takes the 
driveshaft/transmission load off the starter).
