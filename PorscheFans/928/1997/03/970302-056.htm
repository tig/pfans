A story from the battle lines:

I was driving home late Saturday night, in my Porsche 85' 928 S 5-speed
Euro S4-look (that's a long model designation, eh?) and I see a 993 pull up
behind me at a red light. All of a sudden he pulls up next to me, revs the
engine, and floors it, rocketing through the red light. So, naturally I
let'er rip and gave chase. I caught up to him sometime in fourth gear and
was overtaking him, all of a sudden he applied the brakes full on. I
immediately executed a "heel n' toe" gearshift down to third and the brakes
were applied right to the point of lockup. I was horrified that I was
coming up on his rear *very* quickly*, I had to swerve to avoid him and
narrowly missed a Mercedes E420 in the left lane. When I came to a stop, I
was past the 911 about 50 ft (the reason he braked so hard was that there
was a dog standing in his lane, why didn't he steer around it is what I
want to know, anyway, I guess 911 drivers aren't up to par ;-). My question
is, why does the 911 have such better stopping power than the 928? I
consistently run against this problem during high-performance driving. It
takes *much* longer to stop than my BMW (325, 92', ABS) and the Lotus
Esprit (89').

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Paul Hatziiliades
