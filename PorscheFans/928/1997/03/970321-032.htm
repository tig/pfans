Please elaborate on the mod's...

Doesn't sound good to me!

These are hydraulic and shouldn't make noise - have you adjusted / reset
lately?  In any event you might have success with lower viscosity oil to
quiet clatter at start-up or higher viscosity for other times.  No use
using that Bardol stuff, it's like straight 90 wt. and breaks down almost
immediately as well as mucks up the insides.  Best case is to identify the
lifter and replace.

K&N didn't seem to make a difference on my car on the dyno.  This of course
didn't take into account any ram air effect of the car actually at speed. 
In that case I did go on to record 15.08 1/4 miles, exceeding the stock
specs of 15.5 for an '84 928S automatic.

FWIW...YMMV
