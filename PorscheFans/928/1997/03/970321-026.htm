Are we assuming that the K&N filter is worst than the paper filter??

I am wondering if the K&N filter uses a different filtration
technology that is less restrictive but as efficient then the
regular paper filter...  I did hear that using their oil is critical
because it creates a static charge...

Reminded me of an experience that I had with this one lawyer...  I 
placed an ad to sell my camera outfit.  He responded and arranged to 
meet someplace to check the camera out.  After spending 30 minutes 
playing with the camera he was satisfied with the condition.  Then he 
haggled on the price so I slashed $50 off the asking price.  He then 
pulled out a 4 page typed document and said that I need to sign it 
before he pays me.  After reading thru it and trying to comprehend the 
legalese within, it basically said that he has the rights to return the 
camera if it is stolen, found damaged or inoperative within a year and 
not satisfied with the quality of the pictures taken with the camera.  
I said "you gotta be f**king kiddin!  I'm not going to sign this!!..."
He said: "If you're not going to sign it, at least let me jog down your 
driver's license information..."  I said:  "You're wasting my time..." 
and I walked off.

The moral to the story?  Whenever you have something to sell, ask the 
person what does s/he do for a living.

Sorry. Forgot that this list is for Porsche topic only... 

eh, can anyone tell me what's the difference between an 924 and a 928 
besides 4 additional cylinders?
