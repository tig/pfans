And take it from me, the authorities LOVE to pull over nice, loud 928s...

In California, the CHP has been reported to enforce this obscure noise law
against modified cars.  In the least, it gives them reason to pull you over
and check for altered emissions equipment - fix-it tickets at this point I
think but still a hassle.  A good selling point for the new crop of
adjustable flow mufflers though.

Good thing you're keeping your cat too, don't some states have freeway
sniffers in place already?

A final note - I too was investigating aftermarket exhausts but gave up
after my inability to confirm and/or refute vendor horsepower claims
without resorting to buying and dyno'g each system.  Some independent
reports indicated losses even!  That was enough to spook me.  I ended up
trying one of those 'track-only pipes' and went on to record faster than
stock quarter mile times.  Go figure.  

Yes, the XR1 is a racing muffler so you may want to reconsider before doing
a single weld as that will render the parts non-returnable.  (and don't
forget who sold you a race muffler for a street application when you're
looking for advice ;)  If you've already welded them up, an additional
resonator(s) / r. tips might tone it down but then you've just duplicated
the factory setup!  

Is your cat a dual-in/dual-out?  Does that mean the cat is joined together
internally?  Important as if it's not, then an H-pipe or balance pipe
should improve low-end power/torque as well as reduce noise/resonation a
bit.  A good ole' American hotrod trick that really works.

As you can see, when you stray away from stock you are definately on your
own.  Have you baselined your car yet? 

Good luck and have fun!  Let us know how it turns out!
Phil

Before proceeding with this system I strongly recommend you contact Borla
for THEIR advice.  I think this system will be extremely noisy.  The Borla
cat back system you returned is pretty noisy, especially if you have
headers.  Remember, the system you are comprehending uses a RACING
muffler.  That in itself should be a warning.  I have a custom dual Borla
system (two oval mufflers with cats) on my wildly modified Ford Capri 2.8
V-6 and it is pretty loud.  Borla stuff is great, quiet it aint.
