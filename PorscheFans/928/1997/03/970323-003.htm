The horror stories are essentially true.   Removal of the instrument cowling,
center console, and an awful lot of plumbing, wiring, vacuum lines, doohickies
and doodads, are all required.   I don't have the shop time readily at hand, 
but I would bet on two full days, maybe a bit less if I did it often enough.
Remember that all of the air conditioner plumbing and controls are 
integrated into the unit, so they have to be dealt with too.

I have never done the whole thing, but virtually everything just short of it,
including  dash replacements, console replacements, and a lot of heater
control work.   All I can say is that it is all possible for a very patient
do it yourselfer.   As a shop owner I would hate the job but would be glad
to take all your money.

Hope it's something less. 

Dave
