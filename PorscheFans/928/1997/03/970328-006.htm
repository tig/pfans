Not necessarily.  You can go to an 18in wheel and still keep the same 
overall tire and wheel diameter.  You will just have a lot less 
sidewall.  As an example: instead of having a 245/45 aspect ratio on 
your rear 16in wheels, you may have to go down to a 35(you'll have to do 
the math) aspect ratio with the 18 in wheels.
