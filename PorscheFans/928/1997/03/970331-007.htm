After some sexual gymnastics in the front seat of my '83, the rear view mirror 
(no pun intended) got itself busted off the windshield.  The mirror actually 
took some glass off the windshield.  Where the mirror had been was now a small 
divot.  I didn't replace the windshield for a long time because with a 928 
what's behind you is not important.  Anyway, I finally had the windshield 
replaced by a local company.  There are several flavors of windshield tints 
apparently available.  They ordered the windshield and then came to where I 
work and installed it.  The outside mirror... if you can't replace the glass 
and have to get a new mirror, they're like $800.


Part deux:  If you drive any car on the street, tires with less than a 50% 
aspect ratio are going to be susceptible to wheel dings.
