    Unless the wheels have been damaged, i haven't heard of anyone having this problem before with a reputable 
manufacturer.  I've heard of Antera wheels, but don't know more about them.   A place like Discount Tire 
Direct(1-800-483-7555), which carries Antera should be able to give you a their number.  If the manufacturer 
doesn't not have a solution perhaps you should have the wheels checked for any damage or deformation.
