Nope, you shouldn't do it in that way.  Instead of 245/45-16, use
something like a 285/30-18 which has the same diameter but much smaller
sidewall.  You can look under "plus sizing" at the tire rack www site
for more info as I recall.

Let me take a stab at this.  If you're doing it for appearance, that's
your choice but realize it will cost a fair amount for wheels (1 time
cost) and the tires will be pretty expensive (many times).  (One thing
that's easy to forget is how puny your brakes will look with an extra 1"
radial clearance for a 16 to 18" upgrade.)

The racer types will take a dim view of doing it for the above reason
(but that's their judgement & perhaps not yours).  From a performance
handling perspective, tires are part of the suspension and your stocks
go with your stock springs and shocks.  So if you go to super stiff 18"
30 series tires, you're still left with the (relatively) soft springs
and aren't much better after all that $.  OTOH, if you've already have a
Touring Car suspension set-up, use 18 or 19" rims like they do.  (I just
got stiff walled 16" tires and am gonna replace the shocks (because
they're leaking) and do the springs while I'm there.)

Best,
Kurt
