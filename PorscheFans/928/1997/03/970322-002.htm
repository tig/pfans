Has anybody had an engine low coolant light go off and find that there
was coolant in the passenger footwell?  I had the engine get hot on the
freeway and pulled off to add about a gallon and a half of water.  I was
then able to limp it home without incident. I don't see any water under
the car or in the engine compartment but did find the underside of the
footwell carpet damp with coolant.  I'm guessing that the heater core or
a hose to it is leaking.  I've replaced all the other hoses.  I've heard
some horror stories about the amount of labor needed to get to heater
core; does anybody have any experience with this?

Thanks for the help,
