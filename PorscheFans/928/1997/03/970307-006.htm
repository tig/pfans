If you are looking for a place to have it serviced...

I used to take my car to Allen, at A&P specialties.  He's good, fast, honest,
and flexible.  I know he's probably on the other side of town from you, he
was for me too.  But, I went to him after having another shop put a fuel pump
on the car that I didn't need (I'M Service, Ignatio Mares, in case you want
to avoid him).  It's worth the trip.

He might remember me, I had Gran Prixe White, 53K mile, '85 S then. It got
run over the night before I moved to Virginia, Oh Well.  He did belts, and
transmission service, and oil changes.  I never needed anything else.  But,
his price on the timing belt was about $150.00 less than everybody else.
 (half the price for the part @ $40 rather than $80).

Good Luck,
