</excerpt>I=A0have the same experience on my 86.  It only happens when the
fan speed is set to the lowest position, usually when I am sitting in
traffic and therefore there is little airflow through the climate
control.  It also only happens when it is either very cold or very warm
outside.  I=A0always assumed that the climate control cannot provide enough
hot or cold air at the lowest setting when the outside temperature is
very different from inside, therefore it does these quick blasts of high
fan speed to try to get to the selected inside temperature.  I have no
technical evidence to back this up.  Does anybody else?=20

</excerpt>

Yes. I found a correlation, namely with the big electric fans which move
air past the radiator; when they switch on, the heater fan goes full
high. Autosport tracked this down to a bum relay (I think the one which
controls the heater fan; I haven't yet gotten the car back) and we'll se
if replacing this chases the problem.


I had previously, for other reasons, replaced the HVAC controller (the
unit with the temperature slider) with no effect on this problem. It IS a
problem, not a feature.
