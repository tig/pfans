Subject: Headlight problem

Hi, I have a '79 928 w/71k mileage that I picked up at a government seizure
auction about 2 months ago. The car does not have the rubber bumper pads and
the dash warnings are in German. Since it was an auction car, I don't have
any real history.

I have a switch with a headlight emblem on the floor between the driver's
seat and the door sill which appears to be vacuum operated. This switch is
not covered in the owner's manual I bought (from Automotion).  I know there
are Euro and US style cars, but just what are the differences besides engine
HP. One book I read at the library said driving lights are used as
headlights in Europe, is that why my car is different?

Yo Debbi! (Your 1st post here?  Welcome!):

European regulations -- at least for the period your car was built --
required that every car be able to adjust its headlights according to load.
This was an important consideration, since the Euro's enlightened lighting
laws allowed them much more powerful lights than our pitiful sealed-beams of
the time, and a few cases of wine in the trunk would turn a car into a
retina-burning demon.

The knob next (knext?) to your driver's seat adjusts the vertical angle of
your 928's headlights.  These were removed from US versions (I'm not sure if
this feature was prohibited by law or if some liability lawyer was just
trying to justify his pitiful, parasitic living)*, most of which have a
little hole in that position.  By-the-bye, many earlier 928's also
positioned their stereo's front-to-rear balance/fader control on that same
box next to the driver's seat.

European regulations about driving at night using only the driving lights
seem to vary considerably.  Sorry, I can't help you on fixing the power
up-down function on your headlights, but I'm sure someone on the PorscheFans
list will be able to shed light on the subject (oops... sorry... where DID I
put my medication...?).

Don'tcha just love how wierd these things look with their lights up?  I
wonder what the German word is for "Bugeye" or, as the English call their
early Sprites, "Frogeyes."  Once we settle that, we can dress it up
Nietzsche-style...   "uber-whatever."

Oh, by the way, your Euro-79 should be a 4.5 liter car with the Bosh CIS
mechanical fuel injection (which the folks at Devek Performance like) and
about 280-ish horsepower, a nice increase from the US model's 219.  You'll
want to check on how the US smog conversion was done BEFORE you take it in
for licensing &/or emissions testing.  The quality of these conversions, not
to mention the completeness of the documentation, seems to have varied
enormously, which could screw up your ability to register your car or even
sell it in another state.

* re - liability laws: Pick up one of the English classic car mags & read
what people with cars like ours pay 
  for insurance... you'll be astonished even after you do the Pounds->$
conversion!  re - Liability Lawyers: 
  this pond scum is ruining our lives, and making it harder for attorneys
defending people with REAL 
  grievances (I am not talking about hot coffee here!) to get access to our
courts.  OK, this has very little to
  do with Porsches, but I think Shakespeare was right.**
