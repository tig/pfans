It's comforting to hear this.  Now, I can go buy a camcorder instead!  
I did just that in testing the shock and it is STIFF.  I've owned cars 
before where the shocks would go in about 40K.  Thanks for the info.
======================
You're a little ahead of me--my 82 "only" has 155K miles on it.  I 
changed
the shocks (to Koni's) several years ago, and asked a Porsche service
writer what the labor quote from them would be--he said he didn't know,
they had never had to change a 928 shock because they "never" went bad. 
 I
was changing to Koni's purely for performance; as for how to check if 
the
shocks are bad, the old test that I've always used on other cars is to 
push
down hard on the corner of the car, and see what happens when the car 
comes
back up--if it bounces several times, the shocks are bad; if it bounces
once or twice & settles down, they're still OK.
