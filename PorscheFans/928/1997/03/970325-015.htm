I bought an '87 S4 that's needs some attention.  First round of ?'s:

1)  Seat switches - seems to be a common problem.  Do the contacts
corrode or wear out?  Probably just better to replace?

2)  Jacking points.  On the 944's, there's a convenient jackpoint in the
middle of the door that lets you jack the side and then slip the stands
under the jackpoints behind the front wheel and in fron of rear.  Is
there a center jackpoint on the 28's?  If not, recomended way to get all
4 up?

3)  Shock & Spring upgrades.  At least 2 of my shocks are leaking.  Is
there a consensus for replacements?  Since springs are pretty cheap once
you're doing shocks, what "upgrades" do people like (270 lb.
Weltmeister)?  The answer no doubt depends on what you're using it for. 
I'm going to use it for Driver's Ed and maybe some club racing (just for
fun) down the line.  I don't mind really firm on the street but I don't
want to readjust my kidneys after any trip.  (This car does have ride
height adjustable spring perches.)

4)  Repair manuals:  I've seen the recent postings on printed factory
for ~$280.  Are there any decent aftermarkets out there for an
'87?  I presume Porsche repair & parts fiches are available.

5)  FAQ:  I haven't found one yet for the 928 (olemiss spec pages are
good).  As I do things (and there's plenty to do on mine), I'll start
building a repair FAQ from the stuff I do (and the responses I get -
with author permission).  I'll put it on my www page.  I hope time will
permit me to take submissions as it'd be nice to have a complete FAQ but
I doubt I'll have the time to write the whole thing.  Any volunteers to
write a section?

6)  Can anyone in CT loan me a timing belt tensioning gauge?

Thanks,
Kurt Gibble
