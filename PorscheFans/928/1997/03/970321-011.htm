If you have already purchased some form of the information, it shouldn't be a
problem to use another form, or pay someone to give you access to another
form they have purchased.  Also, I do believe it would be perfectly legal to
give the information away, as long as you didn't copy it or sell it or
distribute it widely.  It would be fair use to share it with your neighbor,
or put it in a lending library.  If you put it on the web for your own use,
and others had access to it, would that be a problem?

Who knows.
