|WOOMMMmmm!  Got any pics from Vegas? (anythings postable!)
|How about a first hand description of how it was to track your GTS!
|Any details on Mark Andersen's 928?

Well Mark is on this list somewhere so maybe he would want to give more accurate
details than I have. But his car is (I think) an '87 S4, reduced in weight by
1000lbs (no typo!). It still looks street from a short distance away. Closer
inspection reveals no glass any more, no interior. I can't remember how much
the engine capacity was increased but I beleive the output was in excess of
450bhp. The fuse/relay panel on the passenger floor had been redistributed
across where the dashboard used to be to make space for a fuel cell. The
battery/spare tyre compartment had been removed and replaced by sheet metal.

The only cup race Mark was in (Saturday), he finished in 2nd place after a long
duel with the 3rd place driver.

You won't believe I took a camera, but was having too much stress/fun to
remember to take anything.

My car was great once I started to get used to pushing 80mph at the limit,
keeping my foot hard down against the floor with a concrete wall looming in
the distance. This point lead onto the oval banking, foot still hard down on
the accelerator, up to about 140mph before hard braking dropping back off the
banking through a chicane and around to another 4th gear straightaway.
I just can't describe the actual time trial runs where you are out there by
yourself for 3 laps, .... just WOW!!!

Still recovering, I'll have a grin for weeks...
