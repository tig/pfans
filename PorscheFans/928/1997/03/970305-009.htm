 Hi all,

 Just wondered if anyone could give me some thoughts about using either of 
 these products in my 928.

 Sierra antifreeze claims to be environmentally safe AND says it is phosphate
 free. Since that is the big requirement for our Porsche engines, does anyone
 have any thoughts against using it? 

 Also, I saw Texaco's brand of synthetic oils for a bit under $3/quart with an
 additional $1 mail in rebate per quart. Sure would be nice to save some $$,
 but I really don't know how this oil compares to Mobil1 or the Castrol Syntec.
 Those would be my other choices as I don't plan to spend $9/qt. for Redline,
 Amsoil, or any of the european imported synthetics.

 Oh, last question I just thought of.... where the heck is the heater valve
 in the 928S4 located? I looked through the service manual in the heat/ac 
 section, but it didn't give me a good feeling as to its actual physical 
 location.

 Thanks all and happy Porsche motoring!

 David
