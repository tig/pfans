First post here, (after some lurking)
1980 928 5-spd, rough interior and paint.
I am installing 1979 Euro heads and cams this week, along with a new t-belt,
waterpump, tensioner, and a set of Martin Schneider Headers.  My goal is to
make this car a drivable high performance machine, not an original.  I have
installed Koni adjustable front struts wrapped with Weltmeister 428 in/lb
front coils, and have yet to put one mile on the car wuth the new lowered
stance.  I am loosly following a Project build in October '85 VW + Porsche
magazine and an article in the Panorama.  

Questions: 
1. Does anyone have any real life experience with performance exhaust
systems? In particular the dual pipes(2.5") to the rear of the car vs. one
large(3") pipe to the rear. Is it possible to "over-flow" the exhaust?
2. I have not had a rear sway bar built because it hides behind/above the
trans. Considering the other performance suspension mods, should I
reconsider building a rear bar?
3. Wheels and tires... A well abused subject lately. I like the FRH Turbo
Replica wheel on p19 April 97 European Car mag.  I am told by Discount Tire
Direct that they will fit flawlessly even with the car being lowered....
Comments??
4.  Has anyone installed a 140mph speedo?  I have not undone the column yet
and would appreciate any "look-out-for's"...

I apologise for the long post!!
