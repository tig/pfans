Bravo!!

I used to read the BMW lists regularly, and they had an excellent faq that
was sent out with every new subscribe command.  I think it would be a great
idea, and I would have a limited amount to contribute.  

I think one plan may be to post a topic and collect responses from the group
so that any one person's knowledge isn't taxed to fill out an entire subject
area.  There may even  be some way to set up a special email address to
collect the informantion in for a fixed period of time.  Any other ideas?

I don't have the time or skills to edit, but  will share for any faq project
my time and knowledge to collect the information.
