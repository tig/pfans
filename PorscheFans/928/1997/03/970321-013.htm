The librairy in St-Louis have the oversize wiring diagram from Mitchell.
The book have 11"x17" pages but they do not have every year.  The 86
928 is there but they do not show the 85 model year...  Oh well...

As for the quality of the Mitchell book, they are basically identical
to the factory manual...  So for the one that do not want to buy
the expensive books, it is a great reference.

85 Porsche 928S (in pieces right now)
92 Acura Integra
91 Honda Civic SE
