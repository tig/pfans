  Hello all!  I too have been lurking here for awhile just reading, and 
figured it was time I jumped in and said "Hi" as well.  This seems to be 
the season for acquiring early 928s'.   I just purchased a '79 euro spec 
928 with 89k.  I have a slipping automatic tranny, an alternator thats 
not charging too good (could be Volt Reg I suppose), and need to replace 
the water pump, but other than that it seems to run great! ;-)   I don't 
think P.O. took very good care of her. Frankly, I don't even think he 
knew how to add tranny fluid.  I did this, and have been encouraged that 
it is shifting pretty good, now for a complete fluid and filter change. I 
figured on the tranny being my biggest repair expense, so I may have gotten 
lucky.   Anyway, I would feel guilty asking questions too soon, when I 
have no manuals for the car and haven't really "got into it" yet.  I just 
wanted to let you guys know I was here and say thanks for having access 
to such an incredible resource.  Any initial comments or suggestions on 
my new purchase are welcome, I don't even know what most of those german 
words on the gauges mean yet!  :-)
