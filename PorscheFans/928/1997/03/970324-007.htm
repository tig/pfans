     This is a great idea, and the Internet has made this a fairly 
     straightforward possibility.  As someone else pointed out, 
     Porsche will probably not waste any time with this, so it'll have 
     to be up to us enthusiasts.  Many other car-related websites have 
     fairly comprehensive FAQ's that include troubleshooting tips, 
     technical specs, and aftermarket/performance product info.  As 
     far as I'm aware, nothing of the sort exists for 928.  I don't 
     have regular Web access, so please correct me if I'm wrong!  A 
     website of this nature is a lot more efficient than a mailing 
     list, since mailing lists tend to have a lot of repeat questions 
     as new people subscribe for the first time.  The mailing list can 
     be a great source of info for the website, and it allows new 
     subscribers to check which issues have been hashed out ad nauseum 
     before posting their questions.  Any volunteers interested in 
     working toward such a website?
