Gentlemen:

I was shopping for workshop manuals, and came across this person below who
advertised the widest selection.  I was interested and was going to pass the
information along to the list if I found a good source for manuals.  

But... He turned out to be a waste of time, and I didn't want anyone else to
waste their time.  He has informed  me that none of you has actually bought
Porsche workshop manuals from the dealer, even those who gave me specific
dealers to call last week.  In fact, I bet he doesn't even believe that
Devek, Performance, or Automotion sell manuals.  Although he can sell
"Proprietary" information all day long, at 2 1/2 times the price others sell
for.  What a joke.

His AOL name is SEAL11, and his name is Barry.  Unfortunately I can't
remember the name of his company.  It is on the east coast, either New
Jersey, or Connecticut if I remember correctly.

Barry, thanks for your smart-ass answer.  I can appreciate the fact that your
prices embarrass you, but you could have overcome that with outstanding
customer service.  Low price is not the only objective, and it's up to you to
point that out.  On the other hand you deal in a commodity item and should be
aware that price is the foremost consideration.

Your prices are pure humor.  Your customer service is obviously a joke.  

I would have passed your positive reputation on to several hundred Porsche
and BMW owners on two lists that get read by an incredible amount of do-it
yourself people that need your service (Perhaps even thousands of owners).
 Instead I can tell them, with your own words to back me up, that they can
gladly avoid you if they should happen to see your ads anywhere.

Cheers,

BR
