I just had a fantastic weekend at Buttonwillow in Central California with a
new organization called the Touring Car Club.

This is a group that was formed to provide what VARA, SCCA, etc., has
failed at: fun, friendly, no-hassle racing with maximum track time. They
succeeded. A whole weekend of track time, and not one a**hole to be found.
The organizers are all folks fed up with bureaucracy and politics, and they
were uniformly friendly and accommodating.

On April 19 and 20, they are producing a joint event with the Alfa Owners
Club at Laguna Seca. On June 21-22, we're back at Buttonwillow, driving the
full course. July 12-13, Willow Springs, August, Tustin (60,000
spectators!), September and November, two sessions at Willow Springs.

Touring Car Club can be reached at (818) 284 2183

On this weekend, we used the West portion of the Buttonwillow track--9
turns with some very tricky combinations. I was in the driving school
group, not having done anything but autocrossing before, and there were 21
other drivers in our group. We got ta total of about an hour on track. Mine
was the only Porsche.

There was also a time trial group, which was about a third Porsches, and a
race group of about 1/2 Porsches. Only 55 cars had the track for the entire
weekend.

Top time went to a supercharged 928(!)

Total cost was around $300, and if you didn't get a trophy, you got about
$45  worth of Racers Edge products. I'm not sure of all the financial
details of upcoming races, so deal with them directly on that stuff.
