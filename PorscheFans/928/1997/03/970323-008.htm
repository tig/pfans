Hi Debra,

I'm the owner of a 1981 Euro 928 and have some answers to your questions.  The
Round "switch" between the driver's door and the seat is the head light
Adjustment.  It makes the headlights go up and down to adjust how much beam
Shines down the road.  It is a hydraulic arrangement using some kind of fluid in
A sealed system and the "switch" is really more like a valve moving the fluid
One way or the other to adjust the headlight units.  I had to replace mine and
had a friend send me the unit from Germany as it was never an option on US cars
and not available.  Once your lights are up (you might have a motor problem, bad
relay or a loose wire to the motors...) the light adjustment will work.  If not,
the entire switch/hydraulic hose system needs to be replaced.

You should have both a pair of front fog lights and a pair of front driving
lights along with one rear fog light mounted in the rear bumper to the left of
the license plate.   There are two switches on the instrument pod, left side,
that operate the lights.  The headlights/parking lights are operated by a third
switch if your car is like mine.

I assume you are talking about the two large rubber bumper horns on the back
bumper on both sides of the license plates.  If you don't have them (Euro cars
didn't) you can add them to yours easily.  They should be available used.  I
have some good sources for used 928 parts but am in Sydney, Australia at the
present time and don't have the names/phone #s.  Let me know if you want the
info...

You can further tell if your car is a Euro model if it has ZZZ in the VIN
somewhere.  If you are a member of the Porsche Club of America, call Kim
Crumb-he is the listed advisor/expert on 928s.  He is very knowledgeable about
928s and he races them.  If you are not a member of PCA and want to join, send
me your address and I'll send you an application.  There are local clubs in
Washington.  Good luck,

Don Elliott
