My cable collar that would drive the right side gears appears to spin freely
when the drive cable is out of the collar, and stops spinning when the cable
is reinserted, therefore stopping the left side at the same time since they
are set up to move at the same time.  Was this what happened to you, or did
your whole seat stop moving?  I get the feeling that the motor in my seat is
fine (e.g., the connector isn't actually loose), but that the actual gear on
the right hand side track is stuck because the track end of the cable will
not spin by the motor or by my own pliers.
