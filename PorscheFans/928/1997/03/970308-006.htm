Hi 928 fans
I've been watching for some time now +  I went through most of the
archives,  to research 928's (I'm thinking of grabbing an '83 w/68K miles)
I've learned so much from the list like the synchros and hp differences in
pre 85 mods but my racing days are over so I guess I don't mind the less
powerful mod.  I sold my 83 pontiac GP w/370 HP (6.6liter) sleeper last
fall and when I set out to buy a 911,  it was then I stumbled across a beat
up 78 928 Euro, It probably needed $10k to get it nice again yet I wanted
it so bad I could taste it.  Any way sorry If I'm long winded but I just
wanted to give y'all a little background since this is our 
"First Contact"....

Does anyone know how to decode a Porsche VIN# WPOJBO922DS8604777
or maybe you could tell me where to find the decoder?
