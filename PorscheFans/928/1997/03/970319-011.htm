I've previously posted some info on my upcoming Buttonwillow event (including 
the message below) to the 911 list, where I regularly reside.  I thought I'd 
forward to the other Porsche lists two unsolicited write-ups of my previous 
events, to give you a feel for what goes on.  These come from RX-7 Net members, 
where I used to reside when I had a 3rd gen, before getting my current '90 C2 
Cab.  The event is on Monday, May 5 at Buttonwillow, the SCCA's relatively new 
track.  Cost is $225, and you'll get more track time that at any club weekend 
event.  No equipment required, other than a helmet.  I hope some of you can make
it to the event - it should be lots of fun.  Email me if you want registration 
info (or any other info, for that matter).

     Thanks for reminding me Trev-- I wanted to post about Todd's event too: 
     To what Trev has already described, I will add that if have not driven 
     on a track, it's a great experience and LOTS OF FUN!!  And, if you have 
     driven on a track, it's still a great experience and LOTS OF FUN!!
     
     Todd usually caps the number of entries, so that you are not on the track 
     with a zillion other cars.  At Willow Springs, we always had plenty of room
     
     for the number of cars in each session.
     
     If you are new to this sort of thing, keep in mind that you can always 
     decide how hard you want to push your car (and yourself).  No one's going 
     to laugh at you for being too slow or too inexperienced (unless you get 
     lost on the way to the track, and arrive 2 hours late-- but, I digress... 
     ;-)
     
     OTOH, if you have experience, then for your $$, you'll get use of a nice 
     track, that's not too crowded, with plenty of time to drive, and 
     instruction if you want it.
     
     For the past two events, the schedule was more or less like this:
     
     1. Arrive and register
     2. Short Driver's meeting, explaining the rules of the day (signals, 
     groupings, passing, usage of track/pits/facilities)
     3. Warm up exercises, including a slalom course taken at progressively 
     higher speeds, and threshold braking exercises (not as much fun w/ABS, 
     but hey, it's practice!)
     4. Walk through of the course, including explanation of braking, turn-in, 
     and apex areas
     5. Follow the leader (instructor) drive through of the course 
     6. Triple Martinis (just kidding :-))
     7. Split into groups by experience
     8. Alternate 30 minute sessions on the track (instructor optional) 
     9. Lunch
     10. Alternate 30 minute sessions for the rest of the day 
     11. Pack up, and retire to local dive for bench racing
     
     I haven't seen Buttonwillow myself, but I understand that it's a very nice 
     facility.  I think that Jeff Littrell has been there a few times, and I 
     know there are others on this List that have been there.  If you want to 
     see how Buttonwillow is set up, look at:
     
        http://www.calclub.com/buttonwi.htm
     
     Several configurations are shown, though I don't know what configuration 
     will be used for Todd's event.
     
     At the last two events, RX7Net List members (and RX-7s) outnumbered all 
     other participants (and marques).  I haven't seen a 1st Gen out there yet 
     (Paul are you going?), but there are always 2d and 3d gens, Miatas, M3s, 
     assorted Porsches, etc.  
     
     SO, get you and your car in shape, send your $ to Todd, and let's keep up 
     the RX-7 tradition!

     ButtonWillow Event
     
     Well, Todd Serota has just informed me that the showing from the RX-7 
     list for his next event (Monday May 5) which is coming up pretty fast, 
     is very low. I guess this list has been taken over by people from 
     DC...I hardly hear anything from Californians any more....
     
     It is being held this year at ButtonWillow, which is an SCCA owned 
     track. It has some very nice straights, and some elevation changes. 
     Also some tight corners. This track has a little of everything.
     
     For your $225 you get Dohnuts, Pop, Lunch, Ambulance coverage (seldom 
     needed), excellent (optional) training from a qualified instructor, 
     and all the track time you could ever possibly want. (Guaranteed 3 
     hours, but there is always more than you can physically use)
     
     This is not like those other events you pay less or more for, in that 
     you will get a lot more track time here!
     
     Last September I drove all the way from Washington state just to 
     participate, and will do it again for this event. It is the best track 
     day I have seen, or heard of, esp for the money. You could pay less, 
     but will leave wishing you had gotten more track time. When you leave 
     one of Todd's events, you will wish they were all like that, and go 
     home for a good nights sleep (if the Adrenaline will let you :)
     
     Anyone wishing to participate must pre-register with Todd. email 
     address:
     
     tserota@brobeck.com
     
     For those that don't know, Todd is the X owner of my R1...he finially 
     got fed up with the problems (mostly with Mazda in general) and bought 
     a Porsche.
     
     I know Jeff Litrell (person who drove Kevin's car in the last One-Lap) 
     will be there. There is also usually a pretty large turn out of third 
     gen RX-7's and some older gens. Last event there were also two 
     Ferraris, and a couple NSXs.
     
     Lets fill Todd's email box.
     
     I will be bringing along/testing some interesting things attached to 
     my dad's Yellow R1, which can first be seen at this event.  Guaranteed 
     that you won't want to miss these...
