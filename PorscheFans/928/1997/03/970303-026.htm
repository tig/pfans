The heat problems I had that were partially fixed by the flaps.

Not sure if I have found the permanent fix though - this and
some water wetter have gotten it down somewhat but I may have that
timing retard problem or something else still.  Still seems to be
a little high - slightly above middle and on a hot day almost at
the 2nd hash.

I don't know the reason for the flaps, but all I can say is that
it seems to direct the air flow at the sensor that is reading high heat.
They deflect the flaps and thus the heat based on which of the 4 or
5 temp sensors are reading a high value.  The main thermistor in the 
radiator though is kind of a baseline for everything and if it's broken 
it seems like all of them are off.

It's not a computer thing by the way but kind of like an analog
controlled switch (based on the variable resistance of the thermistor
and the other sensors).  Sure it's overengineered - it's a 928! ;)

btw - I thought that heat dissapation was one reason they used
aluminum in the block?

Leonard, do you have the part number of that chip you're talking
about retards the timing?  I may price one ....
