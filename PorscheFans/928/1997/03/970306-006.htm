Can anyone please help?

I'm in the UK and have recently had a few electrical problems with my 928.

One of the problems is the "Brake Lamp" warning lights comes on when the
headlamps are switched. The lift of US service bulletins are available on
the Web and so I looked through to see if my fault had been experienced
before. It had!

 The US importer had registered and sent a bulletin to all its dealers.

I'm after a copy of the bulletin ref 98710 or any information regarding
this problem.

In addition I also have an intermittent Tempostat and engine misfire. 

Any idea's would be gratefully received.

				Russ Aldous
