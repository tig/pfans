Dick,
Well it sounds to me like you must have the same problem as I do! Have you =
checked the level of your transmission fluid recently as this seems to =
aggrovate the symptoms we seem to be experiencing; not wishing to teach =
granny to suck eggs but on the offchance you aren't aware of the position =
of the transmission fluid header tank it is on the right hand side of the =
transmission casing and should be visible (and fillable) with the car =
sitting normally on a level road. Have you checked for any fluid leaks? =

In concurance with your findings I have found that starting out in "@" =
sometimes helps when cold, and that the 'box can occassionally be coaxed =
into up-changing by dropping into "1" then back into "2", but I suspect =
that the best solution, if not the cheapest, will be to have 'em fixed!

As for recon. units yes, we have a company over here offering recon. 3-=
speeders for =A3405 Sterling plus (Arbirtarily! =A385 for fitting) which =
at current approximate rates comes to about US$650 without fitting. The =
one BIG proviso though is that this is an exchange price so you would be =
looking at 2 lots of shipping (And this is one HEAVY piece of kit!!) That =
said I'm sure they would look at selling it to you outright if interested =
so I'll give you their number anyway; its 0044 181 598 8822.

As an alternative, however, this morning I received a message from =
Stephane Chabot (Hi Stephane!) suggesting that a better route may be =
provided through the latest "Up-fixin der Porsche" volume 10 by PCA which =
has an article detailing the change from a 3-speed to a 4-speed auto, =
something I had believed until now to be impossible! If such a thing is =
indeed possible I personally feel it would be a worthwhile route to follow;=
 get a more recent 4-speed from someone like 928 International and fit =
that, in the meantime you can always keep your old 3-Speed and recondition =
it at your leisure should you ever want to return the car to it's "Factory =
original" form. Personally I am more concerned with making my car as =
enjoyable as possible and am less worried by a non-original gearbox and =
have long felt that though the auto box suits the car very well (and =
manual 928s over here are about as common as Sabre-toothed Chickens!) I =
think that even with the train-like torque of the engine 3 gears simply =
isn't enough to keep the engine on the boil when being "Enthusiastic"! =
Anyway, it's another possibility to consider. Apparently the book is =
available through PCA for $16- $18. (Probably worth a read whatever!)

Anyway, I hope this is of use! Feel free to contact me further if you'd =
like me to speak to the Transmission people over here, though I'll be out =
of contact of about 10 days on holiday in California (To include a visit =
to that Aladdin's Cave known as 928 International!)

Good luck, and thanks again to Stephane for the 4-Speed info.

Daron;
I have an 82 928 with the three-speed automatic, and it has begun to
"slip" when cold--OK when warmed up, but slips and won't shift into
drive for the first mile or so after starting out--low is fine, but I
have to start out in "2", it takes a long time to shift from first to
second, then I have to drive in second for a time--anyway, I have been
looking into a reconditioned transmission here in the US, and the price
I have been quoted is around $1800 US--can you really get one for $800
over there?  I might be tempted to have one shipped....
