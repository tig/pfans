The driving lights that I am referring to don't exist on your car if I'm not
mistaken.  You only have fog beams, that run only with low beams selected.
 On later cars there are both fog beams that only run with low beam selected,
and driving lights that run with high beams selected.

I have a diagram now, and may look at trying to figure it out.  But it is on
fiche and is hard to read for the detailed stuff.  I may try and find another
reader that will allow me to blow it up a little larger.

I don't have sealed beam headlights on an '89 car.  I do get good light.  I
just wanted more, without having to put the high beams on.  So 50 / 100
wouldn't help me because I would still have to put the high beams on and
bother other drivers.
