I have felt a difference in two different 928's.  Mostly on the low end where
the AT gearing is a little tall.  K&N and their retailers make claims of
increased power, and if it isn't remotely true why hasn't someone challenged
them with the FTC for deceptive advertising?  Racers regularly use these
filters, why would they use them if there were no benefits but increased
cost?  If I could (and I probably could if I played with it) set up a ram air
system to force even more cool air into the airbox, similar to my motorcycle
(which makes 150HP from 1100 cc, and weighs only 500 odd pounds), the K&N
would be even better.
