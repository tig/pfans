Hi All!

Sorry for the long post but I am going through my newly aquired 1980 928S
(Euro spec) RHD and have some questions that I hope the members of this
Digest can assist me with.

The air conditioning seems to have a mind of its own. It is summer here (in
Oz) and I don't want the heater on! I use the slider control set to the AUTO
position. If I leave the temperature control at 65 degrees (coldest) the fan
roars away at maximum speed and the fan speed control has no effect. I
presume that the car is deciding it needs the fan on maximum until the car
cools down and it is over riding any manual input from the speed control.
This seems to be confirmed later, when the interior of the car has cooled
down, as the fan speed controller then has an effect. However, somewhere in
between, the fan intermittently changes speed quite abruptly from barely
discernable to maximum noise. Also, another quirk, if I decide to increase
the air temperature a little (say 70 degrees) the heater comes on! The
heater then will not turn off until I turn the climate controller slider to
the OFF position and leave it there for quite a few minutes. I have located
the black box with a moveable arm that controls the air mixing flap but it
does seem to have a mind of its own or is being driven by electonics with a
mind of their own. My questions are firstly, where is the electronic
controller (is it the black box marked VDO that is jammed behind the
monstrous fuse panel) and secondly, how is the system supposed to work? Is
my judgement on my observations correct?

Also the coolant level warning doesn't happen. I do have a slow radiator
leak and so I watch the coolant level every couple of days but it would be
nice to have the sensor warn me when I need to add coolant. Especially as
the car comes with such a device! I have located the silver box part number
928.641602.01 and so I now know what the "Central Informer" looks like and
where it is. I will have a look to see if the float switch is stuck but
isn't it hard to get to it?

It seems that the original radio must have been stolen some time in the
car's history as the one in it now is certainly not a high quality one. I
have what appear to be two original large speakers in the side panels of the
rear seats and two bodgily fitted smaller units up high in the front area of
the doors. These bodgily fitted units are top quality ones with separate
tweeters etc. and I suspect that they have replaced some original mediocre
ones. However, I don't have the front to back balance control located next
to the headlight dipper control knob so maybe my car originally came with
just two speakers. My question is, what are the three cut off plugs under my
driver's (RHD) seat. Did the car once have an amplifier located under the seat?

Another question. I have an electronic box mounted to the guard under the
bonnet. Is it the electronic ignition system or are these electronics fitted
inside the distributor?

The cruise control doesn't work. Sometimes is feels that it wants to do
something when you depress the accelerator and simultaneously push the
little lever forwards but it doesn't work properly. Anyone got thoughts and
experiences on this problem?

Lastly, I have two mechanical problems. The clutch master cylinder leaks and
squirts a tiny jet of brake fluid through the rubber boot and into the
footwell area and I have a growling rear wheel bearing at speeds of over
80kph (50mph). Any special tricks to look out for when rectifying these faults?

Answers to the above questions will be most gratefully received.
