Greetings everyone:

   I just got back from the 17th Annual Zone 1 Tech Tactics(7-9 March)
held at the Sheraton Hotel in Springfield, Mass.  This was my first time
at this event, and it was definitely worth the trip.  The majority of
the event took place over 1.5 days, Saturday being the main presentation
day.  While there was something to be learned from all the
presentations,  i found the Q&A session with Kim Crumb to be the most
informative.  Kim is the 928's National Technical expert.  All SIX(out
of say, 500 attendees), 928 owners, had a small meeting room and Kim all
to ourselves for approx. 45 minutes.

   Kim talked to us about the design shorcoming in the oil flow
passageway of the 4.7 and 5.0 liter crankshaft which, during extreme
use, can lead to bearing failure.  As strange as it may seem, the 4.5
liter engines are not prone to have this failure because the passageways
were different.  This is a case were a re-design of these passageways
caused a problem instead of improving the design.  Now before anyone
develops an ulcer worrying about this let me repeat that it is only a
problem during extreme use, such as track outings, with extended periods
of near redline operation.  Even under these conditions, it takes about
30 outings to cause this problem.

    The best expanation is done with the aid of a diagram, but here
goes.  The later design crankshaft's lubricating passageway for the con
rod bearings were moved from the outside to the inside half of the
crankshaft throw.  High engine speeds act to throw the oil away from the
center(centripetal acceleration), and therefore make it more difficult
for the passageways located on the INSIDE(4.7, 5.0L) of the crank throw
to get lubrication.  The problem appears to be compounded by the
location of the oil filter mount,  just under the #2 main bearing which
feeds the con rod bearings for cylinder #'s 2&6.  This is where the
failures always occur.  At high engine speeds there are air
bubbles(foaming) created in the return flow from the oil filter, thus
helping to starve these bearings of lubrication.  At this time the only
solution, if you track your car regularly, seems to be periodic
replacement of the rod bearings, or a switch to the earlier crank(same
stroke), which is still not a 100 % solution because of the foaming
cocern.  One of the members of our small group, also a friend of Kim's,
regularly replaces rod bearings as preventative maintenance, since he is
apparently a regular at PCA club races.  I believe he said labor on this
runs approx. $500, but don't quote me.  I should of taken better notes.

   There are a couple of other things to report on, but i'll have to
save them for part 2.

P.S.-  If anyone would like i can fax them the one page handout Kim gave
out regarding the crankshaft problem
