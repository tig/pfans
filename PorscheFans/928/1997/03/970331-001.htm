|Does anyone have experience with the sport spring package as sold by =
|Automotion?
|
Richard,
I am work at the moment so I don't have all the details. The progressive rate
springs sold by Automotion were track set up, tested and approved by Kim Crumb
THE 928 guru (PCA 928 technical expert and writer of "Project 928"). If you are
not a PCA member.. JOIN, it is easily the best value for money you can buy for
your Porsche addiction.

I do some track events, but ALL the autocrossing I can get in during the
season. I upgraded my GTS with these springs after a lot of consultation. I was
already running BFG R1 tyres for one season before trying these springs. Oh and
my car came from the factory with sports suspension so I kept the factory
shocks.

They will lower the car about 1", so if you use the car as a daily driver
expect that there will be some Malls/roads that will no longer be accessible.
Mine is already low from the factory (~4.5")so my ground clearance is now
about 3.5". Funnily enough I ground on less things now than I did before as the
springs do not "travel" as far as they used to. The ride of course is harsher
but I thought the ride was to soft anyway. As they are progressive rate, road
noise and smallish bumps do not feel very different. That cannot be said for
larger bumps though! The cars turn in (speed to change direction with driver
input) is dramatically improved making the car very predictable when drifting
through turns. I calculated after 6 autocross events that the springs decreased
my times by at least 4 seconds per minute. When courses are not small (weight
is still a problem!) I now give 993 anf 9111 turbo's a good run for their
money. Of course the driver (me) could still improve a lot!

I just ran the car at the new track at Las Vegas (~140mph) at speed and the car
definitly outperforms the driver! I love the springs (as you may have guessed)
and now enjoy being with a couple of seconds of FTD and getting the car some
well deserved respect.

So my recommendation is if you want to keep the car a daily driver probably
leave the springs alone. If you can live with having to drive something else to
get around locally annd you autocross at least (how can anyone who loves cars
not autocross anyway!!!!) these springs will give you the biggest performance
gain than ANYTHING else you could do to the car (short of losing gross weight).

Hope this all helps in your decision....
Let me know if you need any more info and I will reply from home. I have the
shop manuals if you need some springs info..
