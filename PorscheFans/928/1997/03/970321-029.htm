Hello:

Same thing happened to my 87 S4 three years ago. In my case after I
cleaned the engine the temperature gauge and one of the idiot lights
began giving false readings. I believe it was a double temperature
sensor that was located on top of the intake manifold. The 86 has a
different induction system, so it might be in a different location. The
sensor was skinny and it had two blade connectors. If you disconnect the
right blade connector the needle will go down. After a couple days the
sensor began to dry and the readings got better, but I changed it
anyway. There was a second temperature sensor on the intake manifold, I
also changed that one just in case. This happened three years ago, so
there is the possibility that my recollection is not 100% accurate.

Luis
