| 
| I hope to become a 928 owner in the very near future and have my eye on a 
| 1980 928 with 82k. 
| 
| This car is a dream to drive and although it is not near the top of the 
| performance list of newer models I'm thinking it can deliver a spanking 
| to the '92 Mustang 5.0 (stock) my buddy drives.

Hey Bryan, 
An '80 928 isn't going to spank a '92 Mustang 5.0 (why does Ford call this car 
a 5.0 when the displacement of the engine rounds off to 4.9?).  The longer and 
twistier the race, the better the 928 will perform.  In a quarter mile drag 
race, if the Mustang is an automatic, the 928 is a 5spd, and both are stone 
stock it's going to be close.  I mean, if the outcome was certain, we wouldn't 
have to race would we?  GO GET HIM!

Scott Clapper - '83 928S that turned 15.09 when it had 126,000 miles on it.
You can only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
