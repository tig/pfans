     Hi Everyone at 928 List.  I just found the Webb site.  I have an 88 S4 
     that I have had for 2 1/2 years.  I have also owned an 80 and an 82.  
     I use to  sell Porsches and I have driven them all. 
     
     I also do ALL my own work (except auto tranny).  I totally rebuilt my 
     motor about 5k miles ago and the motor still does not leak any oil.  
     Am I good or what??.  
     
     To be serious, I have the @@##$%^belt tension tool that every one is 
     talking about.  If anyone in the Portland, OR area needs to use it, I 
     can arrange it.
     
     I am interested in buying the diagnostic meter for the ECU's (used of 
     course). 
     
     I plan on having some kind of 928 forever. so I am in this for the 
     long hall.
     
     I have lots of quadcam experience.  I have a factory video on head 
     install and cam setup.  I will be glad to share my knowledge with any 
     928 owner.
     
     I would like to thank the following folks for the help during my 
     rebuild:
     
     1. Susan and Mark at Devek
     2. All the parts people at 928 International
     3. All the people in the parts dept. at the best Porsche dealership in 
        North America, Sunset Porsche/Audi in Beaverton, OR
     4. Doug House (mechanic)at Sunset
     5. last but not least the late Red McCintock
     
     Without the help of all of the above, and some others whose names 
     escape me, I would not have had the success that I have had.
     
     
     Thanks Again Everyone.
