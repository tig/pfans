That's kind of weird. The workshop manual has all the schematics, with
separate pages for, typically, US-Japan vs. ROW cars. How can
they be missing this? 

Of course I have the fiche version of the manual, and the schematics
are damn near unreadable, but a serious Porsche shop should have the
paper version. What is the problem you're trying to solve, anyway?

Incidentally, if you give up with Ira, I can suggest a 928 mechanic
for whom I have great respect in the Boston area. Don't know how he
is on electrical stuff, though; since I'm an EE I have the fantasy
that I can fix those problems myself. Sometimes true. Occasionally.
