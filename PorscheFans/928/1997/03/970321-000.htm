>>Hi, I have a '79 928 w/71k mileage that I picked up at a government

The knob with the headlight emblem is supposed to allow you to adjust
the aim of the headlights up and down - Euro cars only.

First thing to check on the headlight problem is fuse 19 on the fuse
panel under the passenger's feet. 

Incidentally, an important thing about your car is that if the
timing belt breaks very expensive damage will be done to the engine.
It is supposed to be changed at 60k miles, but you would have
to suspect that it hasn't been done to your car. Unfortunately
it's not much of a do-it-yourself operation, because it takes
a special tool to get the tension right. Good idea to find a
shop that knows and loves 928s to get the job done right.
