From Phil Tong <<
Hey Troy, did you do the big brake upgrade and if so, what are your 
impressions / measured results if available?
>>

     Yes I did add the newer front brakes :-) I do not have any hard 
     numbers as to stopping distances, but larger brakes do not make you 
     stop faster. They let you stop from higher speeds and/or repeated use 
     without fade. Don't forget that you are comparing your 928, a very 
     good stopping car, against one of the top 5 stopping cars in the 
     world. It also has Porsche's best brake technology on it and they did 
     a lot of work in the 11 years between your car and the one you raced. 
     Do this same test with almost any other car and you will not be 
     complaining about stopping distance :-)
     
     I will tell you that the first day at button willow I was on the gas 
     all the way or on the brakes all the way and never had any fade at 
     all. The only cars that slowed down faster then me all had racing 
     tires. If you want to really stop, putting on race tires will help 
     more then upgrading brakes. This is of course for one stop only. After 
     that heat will take affect and this is when you want more area on your 
     pads and disc. A good rule of thumb is, if your antilock brakes turn 
     on, you have all the braking power you need. If you need more, add 
     road grip.
