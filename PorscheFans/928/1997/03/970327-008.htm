Some food for thought:

1.  Tune to specs as baseline
2.  strip interior (how commited are you? this part is free at least)
3.  tuned header install (though might break some banks due to custom
exhaust requirement)
4.  don't know of any chips for '82 Euro or US model, sorry
5.  higher octane gas/boosters +  timing advance (be careful with high
altitude/detonation/converter)
6.  nitrous oxide kit (no kidding just dont go hog wild on the jet sizes)

Everything else starts costing thousands ie. bore/stroke job, cams,
porting, final drive gear or trans swap, engine swaps, etc.   I don't think
there are any easy ways to improve on the factory setup.  Any modification
will have it's draw-backs.

You understand the deal with altitude, so be glad that even so,  your car
probably still leaves most others behind anyways.  Anyone else have
suggestions?
