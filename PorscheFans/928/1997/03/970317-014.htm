OK, you volunteered. My suggestion is that it be modeled on the 
924/944/968 FAQ currently maintained by Kevin Gross. It can be
seen at http://www.connactivity.com/~kgross/944faq.html.

It has a first level that looks like this:

       1.0 Introduction 
       2.0 Model Outline 
       3.0 Production and Import Figures 
       4.0 Model Information 
       5.0 First-Time Buyer Questions 
       6.0 Interior/Body 
       7.0 Cooling System and Related 
       8.0 Engine 
       9.0 Clutch & Transmissions 
       10.0 Suspension and Related 
       11.0 Miscellaneous Engine Compartment 
       12.0 Electrical 
       13.0 Performance Modifications 
       14.0 924/944/968 Resources 
       15.0 Copyright Notice 

As you can guess, it does have some trouble-shooting information;
a good thing, IMHO.

The first time I changed the water pump, I've had difficulty in 
removing the harmonic balancer bolt.  Aside from that, alot of patience 
in removing the rest of the components that are in the way.  Tensioning 
the timing belt was a little tricky, but less critical than a 
32-valver.  Took about 12 hours.

I also have an 83' 928S.  It is a 5-speed and I get 25/gallon combined, 
and 21 on city.  I allocate about $500-$1000 per year.  (Yes, I'm the 
one with the 193K mile 928.)  Fortunately, I've managed to do all my 
own maintenance and servicing.  The maintenance cost can be high... but 
what car are you comparing the 928 with?

DEVEK sell an oil baffle that will take care of the problem.  Be 
prepared to shell out the $$$$.
