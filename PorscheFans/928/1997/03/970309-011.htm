I've had just about every problem you could have with the a/c, so here's
what I can tell you.

First, the air mixing flap is controlled by a little black box that you've
found which is, in turn, reacting to the inputs it receives from the slider
on the climate control unit and the temperature values from the inside and
the outside temperature sensors.  Porsche has published a trouble shooting
manual as there are apparently a LOT of problems in this area.  Somebody I
know at the local Porsche dealer felt sorry for me and xeroxed a copy, but
without the cover page so I can't give you the part number.  However, the
introductory sentence calls it the "test plan for the automatic heating and
air conditioning system in Type 928 cars."  This leads you through a series
of tests to isolate your problem, giving resistance and voltage measurements
at all test points and describing how the air flap and other things should
be behaving.  I belive your temperature problems can be solved by going
through these tests (I'd type them in here but it'd take about 15 or 20 pages!).

The fan speed (at least on my '84 928S) is independent of the temperature
setting.  However, if you put the slider into the defog position it will
turn on the a/c, route the air to the windshield, and put the fan on high.

I don't think there is anything behind the fuse panel that affect the a/c,
but I could be wrong.  I am under the impression that the temperature is
controlled by the climate control unit, the temperature sensors, and the air
flap doodad.  I don't think the car's computer gets into the act.

By the way, the outside temp sensor is in the left front wheel well and sits
in an air tube that brings fresh air to the alternator.

The coolant level sender is in the coolant reservoir, located on the right
side of the car, 'way back near the passenger compartment and tucked partly
under the fender overhang.  Mine was also not functioning, so I replaced it
with a new reservoir and sender.  Lots of fun to get in and out!

Mine used to work great, but it has since stopped working so I can't help
you there.  If you discover how to trouble shoot it, let me know!

Oh dear!  You're going to have fun fixing the clutch master cylinder!  I
read on the list recently that you can maybe replace the guts from within
the car (maybe it was a response to your post?).  If not, you can replace
the clutch master cylinder, but you'll have to remove a bunch of stuff to
get to it (where's your brake vacuum booster?  is it on the left or right?
that's what's in the way on my car and has to come off along with the brake
master cylinder).

Fix your wheel bearings!

Good luck with these problems!  If you need parts, consider buying mail
order from either 928 International or Eurasian Parts Select, both in
California.  They ship overseas and have been the best source of parts for
all my attempts to keep my beast running.
