Hi all,

     I've been skulking the list for the last few weeks, thought
     it time to step up and say hello. My name is Mike Fredette,
     in Portland Or, and I've just aquired my toy. A very nice
     86 928S, with only 53k miles on the clock, every receipt back
     to the pre-delivery inspection in 86 from the local Porsche
     dealer here where the car was sold and serviced since new. PO
     was literally a little old lady from Lake Oswego, hardly drove
     it and apparently quite anal about maintainance. The dealer put
     new tires, pads, and rotors, cam belt, a full 60K service, etc.
     I'm really loving this car. Had a few Porsche's in the past, a 
     75 2.0 914, and a 73 1/2 911t, but this car is just a dream to
     drive in comparison. No questions yet, but I'm sure that will 
     change.
