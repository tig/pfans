Hi All!

Anthony Johnson tells us that he has recently acquired one of these fine
machines that is not as fine as it could be. He says:

>I need some advice from a CIS expert for the '79 928. The car
>starts and idles fine, just below 1k, but when the accelerator is
>depressed the motor bogs, gasps, sputters up to 2k when it stalls
>completely. P.O. was not an enthusiast and has neglected our girl. Where
>should I start?

I have just acquired a 1980 928S that needs a little bit of fiddling to get
it right as you can tell from my recent posting with some questions.
Anthony, as your car will be fitted with the Bosch K-Jetronic CIS, the same
as mine, I suggest that you purchase the book entitled "Bosch Fuel Injection
& Engine Management" by Charles Probst. It has an excellent section on the K
system including troubleshooting. If I had to guess what your problem was, I
would start at the Control Pressure Regulator, which is the thing sitting
right in front of you when you are looking at the engine. But, hey, I am no
expert.
