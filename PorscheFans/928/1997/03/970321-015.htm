Well, the timing belt tension is critical on all 928's - that belt
is a monster, and the engine grows a lot as it heats up (there's
a compensator to cope with that, but nothing's perfect). BUT, on
a US '79 the pistons and valves won't try to occupy the same
space at the same time if the belt breaks (if your heads haven't
been planed) so a belt failure or skip will just make the engine stop
running. On a Euro '83, timing belt failure will cause very
expensive interference.

Now, there are surely a lot of mechanics who will just tension the
belt until it can just be twisted a quarter-turn, and some of
those will get the tension right, but you really can't be sure
it's right unless the factory tool is used.
