I couldn't believe the results either!  I really, REALLY questioned myself
before spraying a drop on the wheels but then I told myself, we're talking
928 Porsche Fans here and sprayed away!  Thanks to Jim Murphy for the
Easy-Off tip, it really REALLY works!

Scott, did you see my other post?  I was running 15's @ Sear's Point!!! 
Won one, lost one and I was out.  Took forever between rounds as there was
tons of oil spillage from other cars and a couple of crashes even on the
big end.  No burnouts needed for this particular car, the 928 just motored
down the track and autoshifted  identically each time.  My 1 -2 shift @ WOT
(or WFO for others :) snapped off at 5300 rpm's each time.  2 -3 went to
redline.  I think I'll go back again now that I have a better idea on
bracket strategy, especially at the top end.  The most fun though would be
the time trial runs trying to go all out vs. lifting to win, etc. Cruising
the pits for cool down is fun too, everyone looks at the 928 rumbling by...
 

9-28's Forever!
Phil
