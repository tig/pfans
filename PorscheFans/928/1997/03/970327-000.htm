	O.K. I did it! My pic(s) should be on THE page soon, I sent them wednessday 
night. Hope you all like them. By the way, I was thinking, there are 500+ 
people on this list......so if each person puts in $1, we should be able to 
buy that F%@#*^ Expensive belt tensioning tool. I saw it at Automotion for 
$549.98. Each user could ship it to their house pre-paid and insured. If we 
could work out some sort of credit card deposit, this could work. Sort of like 
a non-profit rental center. This also means we could buy a 993TwinTurbo for 
only $210 each. Of course, at 1 day each, we would only get to drive it 1 day 
every two years. There I go again, thinking...................
