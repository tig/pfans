I have the same situation with my rear pannels.  However, by looking
at them closely, I think that the majority of the shrinking was done
by the leather (It actually pulled out of its staples!!).

However, I hope I am wrong and it could be as easy as making a few
cuts in the cardboard (hey, it is easy to cut, glue and it would
not show).

I will be trying to rehydrate the leather by using lexol soap followed
by lexol neatsfoot (it appears to soak in better than the regullar
lexol conditioner).
