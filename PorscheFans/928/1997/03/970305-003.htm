My guess from your experience is that the Anteras are chromed.

Chroming wheels reduces the oxidation protection.

--Which is not a problem as long as you put low-humidity air into your
tires. But add 'wet' air, and sooner or later, you will get corrosion. And
corrosion begets leakage.

I have seen people use pure nitrogen to prevent this problem, but avoiding
unfiltered, humid air will do it, too.

Once the oxidation has started, you need to see a specialty wheel dealer to
stop the leakage.

Porsche recommend replacing the eccentrics that are used to adjust the 
wheel alignment and a bracket that sits on top of the control arm, 
close to the ball joint.  (Dont' exactly know what the bracket is.. 
Need to look at my car..)  Hope this help.

================
The subject pretty much says it all.  My father has a 1979 928 with the
aluminum ball joint supports.  I convinced him he should update to the
steel units and he told me he found a used pair that are being shipped 
in.

My question is this:  what, if any, additional parts are required for 
this
update.  He plans to have the work done in the near future and I'd hate
for him to drive the 60 miles to the shop (he's in Arkansas), only to 
need
additional parts
