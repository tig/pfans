My reference for my earlier comments is the Porsche AG '85-'89 928
Technical Specifications book. The only spacers it mentions for any cars in
that range are the 17 mm units in the Club Sport and GT cars; nothing for S
or S4 cars, and no other thicknesses. However, my '77-'88 parts book says
the same things yours does, so there is a discrepancy.

>FWIW, my car has the spacer.

I don't have the factory spec book for your year. I'd be curious to know
what it says in the "Rims, Tires and Tire Pressure" section, either about
spacers or about offsets.

>Second point: the offset is the spacing between the centerline of the

Yes. I was thinking about backspacing, and was flat wrong.

Yep. I really should have caught my mistake, having looked for years at the
curving-out ends of the "spokes" on my car's original rear wheels.

>Consequently, the inside of the tire stays in the same
>place, and the outside moves out by one inch, to my thinking.

Just about. Your statement is exactly right concerning the rim. However,
the S4 stock rear tire is nominally 20 mm (rather than 25.4 mm = 1") wider
than the S rear, so its outside sidewall will, if the spacer is retained,
move outward by 12.7 (the difference in offset; see below) + 10 (half the
difference in section width) = 22.7 mm, which still might rub the wheel
well, and the inside sidewall will move outward by 12.7-10=2.7 mm.

>Which raises the question of clearance on the outside, which looks
>kind of marginal. So maybe the spacer has to go after all?

Maybe; it depends on where the clearance is tightest. If the above numbers
are right, taking away a 17 mm spacer (see above) would cause the outside
sidewall to be 22.7-17=5.7 mm outboard of stock and the inner sidewall to
be -(2.7-17)=14.3 mm INBOARD of stock. If the spacer is 22 mm thick, then
the outside sidewall winds up outboard 0.7 mm of stock and the inside
sidewall  inboard by 19.3 mm, which might catch some suspension parts

>That would mean purchasing and installing 10 new wheel bolts, though.

Not the worst idea for a high performance car with a bit of age on it. It's
certainly always a good idea to get new, better-than-stock nuts when you
get new wheels.

>It would be nice to get this right.

You bet. I'm embarrassed to have published any misinformation, and grateful
to you for checking up. I think everything above is correct.

>Nice pedantic point about the space between 928 and S, Leonard

Thanks. I like to think of myself as a nice pedant.

>Incidentally the offset in the 7" wheels is 65 mm; 
>I think you knew that but just mis-typed it.

That's charitable. The spec book knew that, I looked at the page with those
numbers on it, and I made the correct subtraction to get the offset
difference, but I wound up typing the numbers for the GT wheels (60 f and r).
