Does anyone have experience with the sport spring package as sold by =
Automotion?

My 928 is already somewhat harsh over small bumps and road =
irregularities.  Although from feel, it seems to be sprung fairly soft.  =
Therefore, the dampers must be quite stiff in bump. (IE: only high shaft =
speed, the low shaft speed seems a bit soft in bump damping rates.)=20

The transient handling (IE: pitch and yaw) is somewhat bothersome.  =
Automotion claims that this spring package will fix this characteristic. =
 It has been my experience that transients are mostly controlled by =
damping rates, in particular the rebound settings. =20

I do not have specifications for these details on my vehicle and as I =
purchased it used, I do not know what may have been changed by the =
previous owners.  The dealer where I get service has not been very =
knowledgeable about 928's and the suspension specifications seem quite =
beyond their capabilities.

Therefore, any help from those of you with experience in this matter =
would be greatly appreciated,  I could use some sage advice.

FOR EVERYONE'S INFORMATION: I have installed the Chipset from =
Autothority and it has performed as they stated.  The engine has very =
noticeably increased torque from  2000>6000.  The dip in the torque =
curve at 3500>4500 has been moved to 3000>4000 and is minimized =
considerably.  Before installation, I could notice a bit of detonation =
with the best fuels and of course the knock sensors would see this and =
the computer would back off the timing to compensate.  The car would =
fall flat at this point.  After installation, this no longer occurs.  =
Fuel mileage has been reduced to 20 mpg from 26 mpg Hwy. (A good part of =
this may be my increased use of the right foot)  However, I consider =
this a small price to pay for the performance increase.

Thanks in advance,

R. Hudgins
