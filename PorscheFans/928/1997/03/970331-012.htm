Hi,

  I've just joined the PorscheFans 928 group after running across the
  archive pages while surfing for 928 info.  I'm anxious to start getting
  (and giving, when pertinent :) ) some of the good technical data I saw 
  in the archives.
  
  Could someone give me some information on the use of spacers on the
  rear hubs of the 928?  I'd like to know:
  
    a) which year did the factory start installing them?
    
    b) do the factory units simply slip over "longer" studs?
       
    c) are there any factory style aftermarket spacers available?
       (I know 928 Int'l sells some, but they seem to be the type
        which bolt to existing studs and then contain five other
        studs to bolt the wheel to - this seems like excessive 
        unsprung weight.  Automotion says they only have Weltmiester
        spacers for 911s.)
        
    d) when upgrading an early S model (I have an '83 US spec) to 
       the S4 16x8 rear wheels, are spacers still used (or needed)?
       
  Any info would be appreciated.  I want to make sure that any mods
  I do to my car are done with quality parts and won't have detrimental
  effects on other parts.
  
Jim S.

Wrap the bleeder valve's THREAD with about 2" of teflon tape and 
re-insert.  I suggest doing this for all the valves before you start 
suction.  I've had a few situation where the bleeder valve was just 
tight enough to prevent brake fluid leak under pedal pressure, but 
allow air to seep into the line while under suction.
