Part of the problem is weight, the other is where the weight is when it comes 
to braking.  Although the 928 and some other big cars have big strong breaks, 
that 993 probably has stronger brakes then your car (just because it is a 
newer 911 and their brakes rock!). Another reason is weight - the 928 weighs 
more than the 911, therefore there is a lot more stopping power required. 
Another advantage the 911 has is the engine location. In your bmw, most of 
the weight is at the front. When you brake, the weight transfers even more to 
the front, putting most of the responsibility of slowing the car down on the 
front brakes and tires.  The 911 has more weight in the back - when it 
brakes, the weight still transfers to the front (obviously!) but not as much 
weight is on the front wheels therefore more of the braking can be done with 
the rear brakes. Finally, the tires are also a limit. If a car was heavier 
with bigger brakes, yet the tires are just as wide as the 911, the 911 could 
probably win - no matter how big your brakes are, the tires can only hold a 
certain limit before braking lose of the pavement (the same problem occurs 
with acceleration - there is a point where more hp won't help because you 
have to be able to "get the power to the pavement"). I hope this helps and 
i'm not sure it's all right, but i tried!:) Take care,
