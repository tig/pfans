Excerpt from 1984 928S manual (US version FWIW):

Engine oil................ Approx. 7.9 U.S. qts. or 7.5 liters. Check oil
level with dipstick a few minutes after engine has stopped.  The difference
between the max. and min. marks on the dipstick is approx. 1.6 U.S. qts or
1.5 liters.

The oil filter probably holds a quart by itself.  Then take into account
the physical size of the engine not to mention numerous oil channels in the
crank, size and number of main journals, rod journals, etc. and the 8 or so
quarts doesn't seem to high.  There's plenty of piston/cylinder wall to
keep happy!

If I remember correctly, the 928 engine uses a dry sump so most of the oil
is indeed circulating around...

What oil are you using?  Have you seen the new 0w-30w multi-viscocity yet? 
Curious about this stuff (currently using Castrol 5-50w synthetic and
pressure at idle is 2 bar - used to run 1- 1.5 bar with regular 10-40w. 
Weird.)
