In response to Phil Tong, Message 3, Digest 15 March.

Hi, Phil! ...and hello to Patrick, too!

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly on the AT issue. Interestingly =
enough it looks like Pat McKiernan may have a similar problem on his '84 =
model (though I presume if it is an '84 it is what would be known as a "S2"=
 over here in the UK and hence has a four-speed trans?) I was reading with =
interest Pat's experience with various fluid levels and would just like to =
add my findings to the proceeedings. As you can perhaps imagine with an =
oil leak I had a few occasions to work out the effects of low fluid levels =
before I worked out exactly what was going on!

Perhaps it is difficult to compare my '81 model with the '84 but I have =
always found mine to up-shift pretty much at the redline when using a wide-=
open throttle though when I first bought the car it was less inclined to =
do so, a fact rectified by replacing a rather perished 3 inch long length =
of rubber pipe from the engine vacuum to the vacuum sensor (on the 3-speed =
this is just in front of the fluid reservoir. Have you checked this Pat? =
Apparently it is this that lets the transmission know that you are giving =
it a bootful and that it should therefore hang on to the gears. If this =
pipe is clear then perhaps the plastic sensor itself? The only time I have =
had trouble up-shifting has been when (I later discovered) the fluid level =
is low and the engine is very cold, i.e. during the winter over here.) In =
this situation I found the 'box very reluctant to change out of first (=
quite embarising driving through my quaint little village at 30mph with =
the engine bellowing away at about 3,000rpm!) and when it does change it =
tends to hop around through the gears trying to find one that is happy =
with. That being said however as soon as the fluid has warmed through (Or =
better still the level replenished!) everything is back to normal, though =
admittedly the shifts are still pretty soft. How does this compare to your =
findings, Pat?

On the subject of soft-shifting I would also like to canvas opinions on =
how these things should behave. Even in my most lead-footed frame of mind =
I am completely unable to break traction at any stage in the dry, either =
from standing or on the upshifts. Granted there is a lot of grip from the =
245/45 P700Z's but nevertheless the full-throttle shifts feel a little =
sluggish. Does this tie in with other's experiences or is my transmission =
just getting a little old? Apparently it is possible to "Tighten" the =
torque convertor though exactly how one would go about this is way beyond =
me! Any suggestions? Granted however the transmission might be =
intentionally sofy to fill in the yawning gaps between the gears (First =
gear upshift happens at 62mph!)

Further thoughts on the topping up of the fluids, Patrick. (Again this is =
for my 3-speed, yours may differ...) but I have found that by lying on the =
ground beside the car and just ahead of the rear wheels I can just reach =
in with my flexy-hosed oil can (I have yet to find a way better than this, =
and I have tried them all!) and top it up, the advantage being that one =
does not need to jack up the car and that you are filling it with the car =
level. There again maybe I just have abnormally long arms! =

Getting back to Phil's response to my message; yes I think it will be a =
fairly major service issue (removing the transmission). My greatest =
concern is that I have spoken to an "Expert" on these boxes who suggests =
that the main oil-seal is pretty much bullet-proof and that if it HAS gone =
then it is probably for a good reason.... my thoughts were that if there =
was a (relatively) simple way of changing the seal I'd try it and see but =
failing that I'll probably take the car to a place in london and have a re-=
conditioned transmission fitted and be done with it... cost about $800 =
equiv. In the meantime I just check on the fluid level every 5 days or so..=
