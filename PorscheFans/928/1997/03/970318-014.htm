	With a 193K on the clock, your shocks are worn. But, these shocks
	don't really wear like your typical $45 shocks do i.e. they don't
	make you feel like you're piloting a boat. Pretty much the only
	way you can tell is to replace them with a new set. And you *will*
	feel a difference then...

I would get at least an 87' to do some serious a** kicking.  And don't 
bother to upgrade an older model to an S4.  It won't be the same. 
Diligent maintenance and lots of $$$ is expected in order to get 100k+ 
miles on the clock.  Go test drive one first and then make your 
decision.  You won't be sorry!
