Mine too, it's an 88 S4 and I replaced the MC six months ago, now my drivers 
side carpet is ruined and the 1" thick foam underneath is tuned to goo!  Why 
did they mount it on the inside?  I like Doug's  trick of just replacing the 
piston, that thing is so hard to get at. Although if the debris that caused it 
is still in the bore am I just asking for trouble again? Just remembering the 
twisting and stretching  from the last replacement makes me ache! What can I 
use to clean up the massive amount of brake fluid on my floorboards? (without 
ruining anything else) Denatured Alcohol? Acetone? Citrus Degreaser? Brake 
Parts Cleaner? Anyone else...... feel free........

Thanks

Jim 88 S4
