After cleaning, a K&N should be pale white, and after oiling it should be
bright pink.  The level of dirt in the filter is very easy to tell at a
glance in the airbox.  When dirty, clean and re-oil.  I don't bother with
mileage checks, instead I check it every few oil changes.  The oil and
cleaner are cheap and go a long way, so better safe than sorry.  I will say
that my car has a much cleaner filter, overall, than if I had to change a
paper element every time it was dirty.  I would avoid keeping such a clean
filter if the K&N wasn't so easy to keep clean.  With paper it would get
changed often, but would never be as clean as it is now, overall.
