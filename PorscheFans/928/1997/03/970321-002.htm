Just curious, but how much did you pay? I'va always wondered about the
possibility of getting a great deal by attending a gvmt auction.

Sorry, I don't have the solution to this but...

I just finished doing some extensive stereo work to my 928. I think that
what you're looking at might be the front/rear fader knob. I could be dead
wrong (not a first). The emblem is of a speaker, not a headlight. The panel
on the floor is easy to remove. Pull it off and take a look. If there is a
wiring harness connecting to brown, green and blue wires, then this is a
fader knob. I can't imagine that Porsche would ever put a dash control, such
as headlights, on the floor.
