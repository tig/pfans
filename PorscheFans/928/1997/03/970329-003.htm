That has a nice ring.

AND, on a more mundane note, larger tire diameter will make contact between
the top of the tire and the inside of the wheel well during hard cornering
or when negotiating a bump more likely. This can be addressed by cranking
down the spring perches, but we're now fooling with suspension geometry. If
you want the tall tire look that badly, get a 4x4 truck and install a lift
kit and Monster Mudders.

The force and energy associated with a bump in the road go up with the
SQUARE of road speed; your wheel gets hit four times as hard at 120 mph and
nine times as hard at 180 mph as it does by the same bump as 60 mph. That's
why Porsches, if they are used as more than ornaments, need really strong
wheels, well beyond mere DOT and TUV standards.

By the way, the same square law applies to the car's kinetic energy, which
is why stopping from the high speeds our cars achieve so quickly and
effortlessly makes huge demands on brakes, wheels (high braking and
cornering forces can and do tear the spider right out of an inadequate
wheel, freeing the rim and tire for independent exploration and leaving the
rest of the car and occupants in trouble) and tires (the best tires are
quite elaborately designed and built to be STRONG and well-mannered; for
example, check Michelin's Web site at
http://www.michelin.com/us/eng/tire/pilot/mxx3.htm for an analysis of the
Pilot SX MXX3 tire construction).

If you're going to go fast and intend to come home, make the investment in
truly high performance wheels and tires.
