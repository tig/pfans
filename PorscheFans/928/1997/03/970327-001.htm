Pretty funny Jim!  Some sound principles at work though - see the latest
excellence on the 'condo' race trailer team.  I do doubt we'd get the turbo
back though :)   Also heard through the grapevine of an aftermarket
tensioning tool in development - any  takers for guinea pig duties?  Kinda'
scary when you're talking 32v engines...

Sitting in traffic today I heard that familiar wooming sound - snapped my
head to see and yikes it was a 'vette!  Light turned green, FLOOR IT!  I
got the holeshot and 'killed' him to 25mph before he realized what was
going on and roared away from me.

I was driving my (dad's) 4-cylinder colt vista wagon  ;)
