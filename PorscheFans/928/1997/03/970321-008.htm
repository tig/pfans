928's use a Mercedes Benz trans that the valve body can be mod' to start in
first gear rather than 2nd. from moderate (or any) takeoff speed.

Does any bodyhave a spare 90'-94' 928 antannae mast (rooftop) they don't need
and want to sell?

Do the 2 hoses coming out of the bottom of the power steering resivor, if wet
on the outside with PS fluid, mean hose is still O.K. on a 1990 model w/30K
miles?

Any recc's for quieting lifter noise on 928-S-4 engines. They are rather
noisy on both that I've had over the years.

Any thoughts on protection factor or K&N filters for 928?

Find a friendly mechanic with a library of Mitchell Automotive shop
manuals. These are top quality, professional level manuals that many
mechanics use. There is a domestic and an import version and assorted
addendums every year. I was able to find the import cars electrical
addendum for 1982 in my public library which contains a very detailed, six
page schematic for the 928. My car is a 78, but the 82 is close enough with
only a couple of minor changes.

I photocopied the six pages and then "stiched" them together to produce a
single, complete schematic.

Don't even bother with Haynes manuals. My library has the complete Haynes
volumes going back to about 1954 and every one of them is full of
superficial, how to change your oil, how to do bodywork in your driveway,
crap.
