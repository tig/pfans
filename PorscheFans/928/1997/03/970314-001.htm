On my 78 I have had this same situation. The back "forked" end of the knob
was broken and wouldn't retain the spring clip letting the slider control
roam about freely. The fiber optic is not connected to the knob, it is only
inserted into the knobs hollow center. Once the knob pressed into the
slider control and the spring clip, the knobs "forks" squeeze the fiber and
hold it in place. I was able to order new knobs from the Porsche dealer.
They had some minor design change from the originals, so new clips were
required as well. The price was $20 CDN - about $0.40 US I suspect!

When reinstalling the fiber optic, use an exacto knife to shave off the end
making a nice clean end to insert into the knob. Thread the fiber through
the retaining clip then the slider control and into the knob as far as you
can push it, then push the knob back through the slider control and spring
clip. It will be a very tight fit since the knob forks are pinching the
fiber cable. Once its in, use a quality lubricant on the sliders and all
pivot points.

As for the binary temperature problem, while you have everything out of the
console, check that the cable is correctly retained and that the multitude
of vacume lines are all attached and not cracked. The control unit itself
is pretty simple and easily repairable. If everything is connected properly
and the electrical connections are tight, I would suspect the temperature
conrol valve.
