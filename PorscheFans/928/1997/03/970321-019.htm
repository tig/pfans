I had a little lifter noise in the engine and a mechanic used a motor flush
to clean out the gunk.  It worked great.  BUT, I don't neccesarily recommend
it.  I have had mixed experience with motor flush.  In fact I wouldn't have
let him do it if I had known what he was doing.  I simply left the car with
him for some other things, and he did it on his own.
