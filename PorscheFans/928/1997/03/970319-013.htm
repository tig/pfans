I was suprised by the amount of oil mine takes also... it's a lot for a
car.  Some of the aircraft I fly have a 13 quart capacity!!! This is
mostly for cooling though...

My owner's manual has power v.s. speed graphs in the back.  You are
right though...the torque really picks up around 3000 rpm.  If you don't
have one in your car, you might consider buying one from pcna.  Lot's of
good info in there...
