I bet what you did is put the turn signal to the left to test the tail
light you had just changed.  What you did (without knowing it) is turn
on the Left side parking lights. This will extinguish the lights on the
right hand side.  Return your signal to the middle position and all your
lights should come back on.  This is a more important feature in Germany
where parking lights are required when parking along the street, but
only toward the street. This is a battery saving feature.

I'm pretty sure this will help.  If It doesn't, let us know.
