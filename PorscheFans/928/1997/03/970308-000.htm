That makes two of us... =20

There are many listed in Classified 2000, Automotion sponsors a search
engine, Hemming's, etc.  What is your budget and are you willing to suffe=
r
through the long-distance buying process? =20

Do not be desparate - especially given the price point of this model, les=
s
than honest sellers and potentially skyrocketing costs of repairs
(reminding myself at the same time).  Do be enthusiastic as I have found
many low mileage examples - they are out there!   I see a half dozen supe=
r
low mileage cars this week alone.

Remember though, it is imperative someone checks out the car mechanically
no matter what the seller says -> used cars =3D NO WARRANTY, AS IS, GOODB=
YE
$20k+, NO REFUNDS.  And probably right when/if a service issue pops-up, y=
ou
see another car!  Caveats abound...

Ok, now that I've hopefully warned both of us to err on the cautious side=
,
I have a lead for you that I was following on but will probably not
consummate for reasons I won't go into now.  Lucky for you the car is
'close by' in OR.  Unlucky for me is that I've only been able to get
superficial info from the seller after a week of phone calls & emails so
I'm not flying up there.  See the classified 2000 page for 1987 S4 5 spee=

Good luck fellow 928 fan!!!
