Greetings Fellow Fans!

Just a brief query for any of you automatic transmission experts from the =
other side of the pond (Any other regulars out there from the UK?) I own a =
trully wondrous 1981 Model Iris Blue 928S Automatic (Rhd, Euro-spec. =
obviously!) and wonder if anyone could help me out with a bit of advice. I =
have a slight leak of transmission fluid emerging from the torque-=
convertor housing of my transmission assembly (basically coming out of the =
inspection/ vent holes). Having spoken to various "Experts" on autoboxes (=
a rarity on this side of the atlantic!) I have been lead to believe that I =
probably have a faulty/ perished oil seal between the torque convertor and =
the transmission proper. Does anyone have any thoughts on this diagnosis? =
If it is correct I presume that I will need to remove the entire =
transmission assembly from the car in order to remove the bolts securing =
the torque convertor housing but looking at the underside of the car it =
would appear that in order to accomplish this I will need to also remove =
the aluminium "Subframe" from beneath the assembly, not to mention the =
entire rear suspension which is bolted to it! If this is necessarily the =
case then so be it but I would rather do it the "easy way" if anyone knows =
of one! Assuming that I do indeed need to remove everything does anybody =
have any advice as to the proceedure (Bearing in mind the lack of availabil=
ity of manuals in any form other than Microfiche!)

Finally I would like to canvas any thoughts (positive or otherwise!) on =
the Eibach lowered spring kit. I am on the verge of buying this and would =
love to hear from anyone with experience of this, and in particular any =
advice on necessary modifications to the geometry, rear spring-seat height =
etc. to make the most of this (Apparently I'll be looking at a ride-height =
drop IRO 30mm).

Thanks in advance for any help or advice you might give. It is great to =
find so many fellow fans of this formidable (and drastically under-rated!) =
car.

Best regards,

Daron Townson
