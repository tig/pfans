I have the same; 84 928S AT, 111K. The only mod I know of is a K&N. 

My 1st shifts at 5700 and when 2nd hits, the rear tires break loose for about
200 millisec and the ass end kicks sideways about 3 or 4 inches! Feels awesome!

My AT leaks a couple of drops per day. 4 months, and it's half a quart low.
This isn't bad enough to warrant my "going in" there yet. But I have learned
some interesting things about the AT fluid level. 

1) Too low:
   After about a quart down, the car redlines too long because the
   tranny doesn't want to shift. (Not enough pressure?) Eventually, it does
   shift, but it's a soft shift. This scenerio seems to rob about 30% of the
   torque. After more fluid leaks, the car no longer shifts! That's right...
   you're stuck in 1st. At this time, I had no idea of what the problem with my
   baby was and, in a state of panic, I limped/rushed right over to my mechanic.
   It turned out that the car was about a quart low on AT fluid. Wow! That
   was simple and inexpensive and the car feels better that EVER!
   
2) Too full:
   Oops. Never overfill a cold tranny. I thought I was starting to feel the
   torque robbing symptom of low fluid. It was low. The filler tube for this
   car is located in a very easy to reach area. (Ha!) Now, after you get under
   the car, you realize that you can't pour the fluid into the fill hole
   because the floorpan is 2 inches above that. Hmmm... Well, I came up with
   a clever, simple solution. I had a trigger activate oil can with a long,
   thin spout on it. I had a clear piece of tubing similar to aquarium air
   filter plumbing, only larger, which fit nice and tightly over the oil can
   spout. So, I filled the oil can w/ AT fluid and stuck the hose into the 
   filler hole and began pumping. The "zone" markers are on the side of a
   translucent plastic cylinder (complete with the typical Porsche filter
   basket at the top). Unfortunately, I just couldn't see the fluid as it
   rose to, and on through the "zone" lines and I ended up overfilling. Well,
   like the ignoramus that I am, I thought that maybe this would all get
   sucked into the ferrules of the tranny once the engine was fired up.
   
   The next day, I started driving the car and noticed that it consistently
   shifted WAY too early...like at about 4 or 5K for *every* shift when floored.
   Hmmm... When I got home from work, I went back under the car to take a 
   look at the fluid level. (The car is warm now). I took off the cap and
   AT fluid starts gushing out! Ouch! That stuff is hot! OK, ummm...this has
   been overfilled. So I used a clean sponge to dip down into the plastic
   cylinder and extract excess fluid. Then I capped it off and took it for a
   spin. 
   
   YES! Back to the crisp, perfect shifting.
   
BTW -- How many people actually know the nitty-gritty details of the way the
       AT works. Details beyond concepts and overviews. Details like, fluid
       is pumped through this slot and builds pressure until that valve opens
       and then it...  
   
This all goes to show what an idiot I am for playing around with the car while
not having any manuals and not knowing anything about German sportscars. It's
not at all as simple, easy and forgiving as all of those mid 60s musclecars
that I've bastardized.

Even though my 928S has 193K, the overall condition of it is above 
average as compared to other 928 that I've seen.  The interior is in 
excellent condition.  Aside from the general mechanical maintenance 
that comes with a car of this caliber, what I'm really meticulous about 
are oil leaks.  An oil-covered engine tend to run hotter.  And any 
exposed gasket material would be like a sponge, absorbing the oil, 
shortening its life.  Have you checked the oil pan bolts recently?  You 
just might be surprised!  At one point, I can remove mine with my bare 
fingers!

>1.  With the recent discussion of high-mileage (193K!) cars / engine

Sounds like when you pushed in the remaining part of the slider switch, 
you've "lift" the mechanical wiper internally off the circuit board 
inside.  You need to take it apart to be sure.  But BE CAREFUL in 
disassembling it.  The tangs are pretty cheesy.  As to the temp 
selector, I've had the same problem, and traced it back to the 
temperature sensor mounted on a flexible air hose coupler which is 
located on the driver-side fender.  You need to remove a plastic panel 
directly toward the front of the wheel.  One end of the air hose goes 
to the Alternator's rear cowling.  Verify that the connector plug are 
making contact.  Mine was corroded.  A shot of some TV tuner contact 
cleaner and an old tooth brush seems to do the trick.

Gulp!  I would spend $120 for a rebuilt and replace ASAP or spend 
$$$$.$$ to replace the flywheel AND starter!

>no problems other than very intermittent rattle from starter gear at 
idle
>(bad solenoid not pulling gear back?)

Hmmm... mighty tempting.  (Is PORSCHE subscribed to this listserver?)  
I sure wouldn't want them to knock on my front door.  Heck, I would be 
in deep sheep if they see my tool cabinets with Porsche decals covering 
over the word CRAFTSMAN.  (Thanks for the offer, I plan to buy my own 
set and hit the library when needed.)

>>I've made some calls today inquiring on viewers.  Found that fische
