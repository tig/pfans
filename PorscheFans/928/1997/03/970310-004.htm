From: Leonard Laub <leonard@visionthree.com>

|  I've been conducting a campaign against BFG Comp T/As, which don't seem to
|  suit the 928's suspension and have real QC problems.

I agree with Leonard on the quality problems with BFG Comp T/A's.  I had them 
on my Merc and had a tire develop a flat spot.  And I mean these were tires 
that were rotated every 5k miles.  



|  Be leery of generic replica wheels;

The only non-Porsche wheel I would put on the car would be BBS.

New subject:  Leaky 928 gas tanks can be repaired.  From what I've seen, the 
most common cause of leaks is the cradle that holds the tank in place chaffing 
through the plastic tank.  I repaired my tank with a marine epoxy.  After the 
repair, I installed some material between the cradle and the tank to prevent 
further rub-throughs.

One more subject: Phil Tong gave an excellent procedure for cleaning and 
polishing wheels involving Easy Off oven cleaner followed by polishing 
compounds.  NOTE TO PHIL: the phrase obsessive compulsive comes to mind... and 
I love it!

The last subject:  Cruise Control.  Here are my ideas...  Make sure the stop 
light bulbs are the orginal German bulbs or always disengage the cruise 
control using the steering column mounted stalk rather than tapping the 
brakes.  Secondly, resolder every joint on the cruise's amplifier.
