Hi Pete,

I did remove the "bolster" in my 85 without too much problem without
consulting the factory manual...(did not have them at that time)

The procedure is fairly straight forward if you go step by step and
involve taking off a zillion screws here and there.  Also, you need
to remove the back seat rest, the "woffer" cover and other misc. stuff.

The only thing that was a surprise was the snap connector, similar to
the one holding the door pannel, holding the window "wrap around".

All in all a fairly straight forward job if you go slowly.

Now for the tricky part. How do you plan to fix the leather??  Mine
looks like it dried up an that is what caused it to warp.  I thought
that it might have a better chance to strech back into shape if you
treat it in place while it is under tension.  But I am still working
on the timing belt and the two front seat and ...

Good luck and keep us posted,

Stephane Chabot
85 Porsche 928S (in too many pieces right now)
92 Acura Integra
91 Honda Civic SE
