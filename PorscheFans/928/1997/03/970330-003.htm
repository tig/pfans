Yes.

The first is important because the 928, unlike the 911 or most other
performance cars,  offers a remarkable combination of crisp handling and
comfortable touring. If the latter doesn't matter to you, then go ahead and
make things stiff, but you probably would be happier in a 911 or some other
more determinedly "sports" car.

The second is important because the 928 is not light, and the wheels and
tires are not as big relative to the car's weight as those on many other
performance cars, so a given bump is harder on a 928's wheel than on, e.g.,
a 911 Turbo's wheel of the same size.

Meanwhile, lots of people with lighter, stiffer cars find the same problems
with ultra-short sidewalls. Beware!
