> Greetings Fellow Fans!

Welcome to the best newslist on the 'net!


> Assuming that I do indeed need to remove everything does anybody have any
advice as to the proceedure (Bearing in mind the lack of availability of
manuals in any form other than Microfiche!)

Sorry I can't help much here but looks like you have a pretty involved
service issue.  Even if you sent the car out this might be a good time to
spring for the hardcopy service manual.  I've stuck to mostly bolt-on type
of mod's and thus why I haven't purchased my copy *yet*.  It's coming up
though...

the Eibach lowered spring kit. I am >on the verge of buying this and would
love to hear from anyone with experience of this, and in particular >any
advice on necessary modifications to the geometry, rear spring-seat height

drop IRO 30mm).

Are these the progressive rate set?  Seems to be a hot ticket (pardon the
pun) as long as your wheels aren't offset weirdly to avoid fender rubbing. 
There are many list members with modified suspensions that could lend
assistance here.  Again, I've left my car stock at this point.  I did see a
'garage sale special' from Automotion's webpage on spring sets, among other
928 things - you should check it out!  


>Thanks in advance for any help or advice you might give. It is great to
find so many fellow fans of this >formidable (and drastically under-rated!)
car.

Now that prices have dropped on used models, I've seen quite a lot more of
them around town.  Pre-
S4 that is...  I still refuse to park mine on the street though!  

Watch that ATF level until the leak gets solved,
