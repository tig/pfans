Thanks for the details Pat!

It seems Porsche / Mercedes Benz played around a bit with AT builds.  I
have an article from a Euro magazine making the same complaints about early
1st gear shifting also.  But theirs shifted at 5k even.  Maybe this trans
is super sensitive to fluid levels!  But that was a review of a new car!  

As you probably know, American and Japanese A/T's are easy to modify for
shift rpm and speed of shift by installing a shift kit.  I was hoping Devek
would come up with such a kit for the 928 but they must still be
researching.  I would really enjoy being able to hit redline in 1st in this
car and wonder why the heck it wasn't engineered for such to begin with,
original country club target market not-withstanding.

I had my fluids changed right after I bought it and haven't checked it
since.  Hell, I haven't even gotten a chance to drive my car for the past
two weeks (I know, I know, at least it's not snowed in here in Calif) but
will check it this weekend (along with ordering a new starter, ok?). 
Luckily Mom's garage is slightly sloped so once I jack up the car it will
be level...

At least I have NEVER neutral dropped this trans.  Boy would that be an
expensive mistake!
Phil
