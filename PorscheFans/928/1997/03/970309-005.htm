Hi All!

First off, thanks for the reply to some of my questions, in particular, John
White who seems to be this Digest's self appointed guru. It is gratifying to
see someone put his time and expertise at the disposal of others (not to
mention his very expensive service manual!). I have sorted some things out
but still have some questions that I would be most grateful to have some
assistance with.

The air conditioning seems to have a mind of its own with regards to fan
speed. I now have an idea of where to look for problems but do the
electronics control the fan speed? Are these electronics located solely
within the black box with the actuator arm and behind the slider controls or
is there another control module somewhere?

What is the black box marked "VDO" that is jammed behind the monstrous fuse
panel?

As far as the radio/speakers go, I have sorted out the cut off connectors
under the driver's (RHD) seat. They solely go to the balance control that I
found lying under the carpet. As there is no hole in the plastic handbrake
cover for this balance control to have ever been mounted, I have two
theories. The first is that the original handbrake cover was replaced by one
without the balance control hole and the second is that Porsche left it like
this when they built the car (???). The balance control is redundant anyway
as the newly fitted radio has one built in. I have tidied things up by just
removing the control and associated wires/plugs instead of leaving them
sitting under the carpet.

Another question. I have an electronic box mounted to the guard under the
bonnet. Is it the electronic ignition system or are these electronics fitted
inside the distributor?

The cruise control doesn't work. Sometimes is feels that it wants to do
something when you depress the accelerator and simultaneously push the
little lever forwards but it doesn't work properly. Anyone got thoughts and
experiences on this problem? I would really like to get this fixed and I see
another Digester with a similar problem. One answer to fix both people?

Thanks to Doug Cook for his post re the clutch master cylinder leak which
squirts a tiny jet of brake fluid through the rubber boot and into the
footwell area. When I was looking at it, I said to myself "I wonder if I can
fix it from the footwell?" I will certainly try to fix it this way and let
you all know the result. Also any special tricks to look out for when
replacing a growling rear wheel bearing?

Thanks in anticipation for the answers to these questions.
