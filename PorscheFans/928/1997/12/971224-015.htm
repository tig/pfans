I don't disagree that the problem might be the battery.  However, I find
it interesting thatsome people goes through batteries like it was gas.

Check the ground wire connection to the body.  Mine had some corrosion
that would
rob my system of about 0.5 volts.  You might also check your
starter connection just in case.

A battery should last a long time.  I had my CRX 3 years without the
need to
replace the battery (I know it only have a 1.6L 4 cylinder but it was in
Timmins
ontario where you get weeks at a time of -40 temperature without the
wind and
my drive to work was not long enough to get the engine warm.  Also, I
have a 92
Acura with the original battery).
