Hello 928 peoples!  In January in south Florida (Palm Beach) the Ferrari
club is having it's big annual meet and concours and I was thinking that
would make a killer 928 road trip for any southern/east coast people
that might be interested.  They'll have breathtaking examples of high
dollar 1950's and 1960's cars (my favorites) etc.  It's in Palm Beach at
the Breakers hotel 800-833-3141 and the concours is Saurday January 24. 
E mail me at eric.hoffman@hboc.com if this sounds appealing.

Another big show is at Amelia Isalnd in Georgia in April.  Road & Track
is calling it "Pebble Beach East".  It's multi make and I know Mercedes,
Ferrari, Rolls and Porsche had a good showing last year.  Lastly, the
biggest classic Mercedes annual event will be in Savannah, Georgia in
August.  It's called Star Fest.  I would argue that 500 SSK's and 300 SL
Gullwings and Roadsters are among the most appealing cars ever built and
their values reflect this!  Again, E mail if you'd like to turn any of
these into a 928 road trip.
