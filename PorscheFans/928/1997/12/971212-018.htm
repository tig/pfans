Here's my little commentary on the water pump.
I have an '84 euro 928, and my water pump died.
This caused the car to begin to overheat, which is very bad to do to any
car. When the pump was pulled it was pointed out to me that the shaft of
the pump is metal, yet the impeller blade assembly is made of plastic,
and it is simply pressed onto the shaft. Of course, under high heat, and
years of age, the plastic became brittle, and spun right off the shaft.
Poor design there. You see no leaks, and the pump appears to be turning,
but you get no water flow. The new pump came with metal impeller blades,
so apparently Porsche got the message somewhere along the line. So,
given the age of your car, and what year it is, I would indeed recommend
replacing the pump if you already have the engine torn into for
something else.
