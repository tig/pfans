That's a good one.  I didn't see if the message was posted to all and
hope we *don't* add these wings to seats with lateral support.  Or why
not, soon enough we'll have enough parts to build a whole car.

To new owner with 4 year 'in-storage' car:
I would verify the motor turns over by hand first before cranking with
starter - what if it's frozen!

Beyond that you'll want to flush all fluids and trust me start replacing
all rubber hoses & belts.  Waking a car from a deep sleep is not a
trivial matter!  Just look at the fine coating of rust on the brake
rotors and that should prove the point.

Once the car is mobile again you'll have to repeat the flushes to rid of
the contaminants.  Don't take anything for granted especially the
braking system.  Anyone know if the t-belt would be 'flat-spotted' by
sitting there?  The list goes on and on...

Good luck!
