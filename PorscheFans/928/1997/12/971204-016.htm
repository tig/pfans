I'm new to the list, mainly because I just stumbled across it about a week
ago as I was checking out 928 pages on the net.  I have always liked cars,
but the big cheese, lead dog, undisputed top of the list car I've always
dreamed about is the 928.  Shortly after finding the 928S4VR page, I found a
list of cars for sale.  Two days later I drove home a 1980 German model 928S
from around Milwaukee.  This lead to a variety of questions, many of which
have been answered just by watching the list.  The one I have now is about
the color of my car.  It's (apostrophe noted) metallic green, and the PO
said that this is the original color.  He did have it repainted, but said he
had the color matched.  He says the color is "oak green," but the plate on
the door is written in German, and I don't do well with that language.  Is
this a legitimate color, and can I get this paint for touch-up work?  Also,
I don't really know what things are different from my car and other 1980 928
US models.  Should I buy parts for a 1980 928, or a 1983 928S?  Thanks for
all your help and information.

I live in the Metro Washington D.C. area, can anyone recommend a reputable

Porsche mechanic specializing in 928s, preferrably in the Northern Virginia

area.>>

This may be a little late, as I've just come back from vacation.  But . . .
how about Autosport Systems Group?  They hosted the frenzy.  Located near
Tysons.
