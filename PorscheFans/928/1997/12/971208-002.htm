Whatever the problem is, get it checked out. My car had a poor job
done on a clutch replacement sometime before I bought it, and the
imperceptible vibrations caused by that were conjectured to be
the cause of failure of the transmission input bearing. The point
is that the vibration could have secondary effects, expensive ones.
So don't put off dealing with it.
