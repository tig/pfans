Yeah, I know what you mean.  My wife and I were at the Porsche only 
swap meet at Ski-Rountop in PA one year, wandering around looking at 
all the parts, and she said to me, "You know, a naked woman could walk 
through here right now and none of these guys would even notice". 

Unfortunately, I think she was right!

 << I have a copy of the 928s4 demo video that the Porsche dealers used in

  beginning (I think) but it is copyrighted.

 I would love to have a copy.  I won't tell if you won't.  
 
 Thanks.

Has anyone driven an SC400 ?   How does it compare to the 928?  I know I'm
asking for a biased opinions, but any first hand info is appreciated.
Thanks,
