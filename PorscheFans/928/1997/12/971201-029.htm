In a message dated 97-12-01 23:42:00 EST, you write:
(snip)
My guesses on your questions:
1) The dip process is applied to the metal after it is installed. I believe
they dip the entire chassis. There is a process (the name escapes me) that
applies the zinc to sheet metal before it's formed.
2)Large removal of the zinc could jeopardize the steel. With small removals,
the zinc can actually reprotect through electrolysis. Also painting the steel
will act as a good protective plating
3)Yes, all different metals will have a galvanic potential. The question is
how much. The mil-specs state a difference of about .25 Volts requires
special consideration. Zinc is -1.05Volts and low alloy steels runs about
-0.70 depending upon alloy. That's how scratched zinc plated steel can "heal"
itself. Aluminium is about -.80. That is close to steel, but steel has to be
protected from oxidizing (rusting) so it's usually plated or painted or ????.
I would think(hope) the factory has taken some  measures to either close that
potential or electrically insulate the joint or ????. 
 
As you can tell, this is a long and boring subject and I barely understand
it, but I hope that helped.

John,

Not boring not, given the content, too long!  Many thanks.

Well, landsharks, who, if any of you, have ANY visible rust?  If so, where?
 If not, why have so many of you -- how many -- parked your cars for the next
4 months?  Dismantlers (e.g., Mark Anderson @ 928 International, Paul H) and
restorers, where do the worst case cars that cross your doors on the way to
shark heaven rust, and how severely?

My guess, let's find out if I'm wrong, is that few or even none of us have
"the curse."
