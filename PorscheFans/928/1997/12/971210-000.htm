Uh, hiya!  Far as I know the GT is 'unpinned' - however the car arrived
with 255's for the rears and when Devek got the new Dunlops all around
for me again they mounted 255's.  Is this significant?  I don't know but
they've been modifying GT's alot longer than anyone.  What I know for
sure is that on advice I ran with my street pressures vs. the pressures
stated in the manual and gone was the tail happiness of my first AX
event.

Marc runs 315's for speed events and pinned the axles on the white car. 
He explained to me why briefly along time ago but I don't want to quote
him out of context.  So... give him a call if you're planning on Phat
tires and this procedure!  I am sure he would welcome the inquiry and
take the time to fully explain this.

It wasn't so much de-Weissachization but fine tuning the effect for
surefootedness.

ps.
Hey!  Cheeseheads!  Leave those seats alone...
Pretty funny Philip Adamson!
