                        Often the sensor or (on such a late model) loose
connection at the sensor.

 I would guess faulty switch in both the above.

 The operation guide for my 968 says in this situation press the AM/FM
switch (also called the band selector switch) 2 seconds. Then, depending on
how many wrong codes have been entered, the screen will change from blank
to "CODE" in 15 to 60 minutes.  At that time you enter the code.  I don't
know about the zero.  Perhaps you have been given the wrong code.

 Have you driven a 944?  I would be interested in your impressions
comparing the 944 and 928GTS.  My brief experiences with '83 and '88 928s
left me feeling the handling was rather tank like.  I am hoping the GT/GTS
might be an improvement.
