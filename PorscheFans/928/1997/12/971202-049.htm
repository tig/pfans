I have recently inquired on having a car checked out by a Porsche dealer
in the Houston, TX area.  There are 2 dealers, one will perform a check
for $150 but does not want to because of liability issues.  The other
Porsche dealer refuses to perform an check due to liability issues.
The first dealer said they were sued because a car they recommended
turned out to have problems.  
Also I was trying to find out who has performed the service on the car
by the VIN.  The current owner has only owned the car a short time, does
not know where it was serviced.  The first dealer said they did not
service the car the other dealer did not even want the VIN.
Is there a good place in the Houston area to have a 928 inspected?

Ken
