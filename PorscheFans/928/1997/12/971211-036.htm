Here's the info on it that I have.  This is from Joe Edwards at Speedtoys,
www.speedtoys.com.  He is still waiting for final info on the 5-6 psi model
for 3.0 and larger engines.

>The item in question is the Superpac.  It is an electricaly driven

These are all prelim #s as the larger unit data is not all available yet.

>Boost 4-5PSI
>Superpac will install anywhere in the intake line.
>Current models run in cycles 16sec boost 8 sec recycle time.
>Designed to operate at WOT.
>New units will be available in a continuous operation model.
>Draws 90 amps at start and 50 amps while runnning.
>Approx cost $2000.00 (not yet firm)

This means that it will still be in the engine bay, but that you don't have
to worry about getting the pulley onto the crank pulley and moving all
kinds of things around.  Probably still some moving to be done, but a lot
less.  He confirmed with me on the phone that they should be about 5-6 psi
as the earlier ones mentioned above were for small 2.0 liter or less
engines, but the new continuous operation ones will be for larger motors.

Hope that helps out and I'll keep you updated as I learn more.  This is
something I'm also interested for to go with my Supra that I have now as a
future mod.
