Merry Christmas to all! Yes, even those who don't recognize/celebrate
this holiday.  ;-)

I just wanted to say that it's been a _great_ year on this list. You
people are the best of the best! Please, try to post more often. It's
like a habit now...I *need* a larger daily "fix" of 928 info. 

I'll be in Tucson, AZ visiting my parents from the 27th thru the 5th.
Doing alot of mountainbiking! You probably don't know that my dad's a
rather famous author of sci fantacy material. Dennis L. McKiernan. Do
a quick search on the net...you'll find him.

I'll be riding in a friend's Toyota 4x4 out there. I _wish_ I could take
my '84. My mom (yes mother!) actually thought it'd be great if I drove the
928 out so they could see it. Alas, the mountainbiking excursion calls for
a vehical that can negotiate the roughest terrain (rocks, ruts and the like)
on the way to the "trail-heads".

I'll be doing some heavy catching up on the 6th. It'll be like a party!
Sooo much material...all free!!! It make me feel all spoogie inside!

Hey, PT! 928s4vr!!!

Quick hybrid update. About 3 hours on the motor now. Only taken it up to
3K once. Gotta keep the foot outta it. I CAN'T WAIT TO FEEL THE FOUR BARRELS
KICK IN! But I must wait. :-(   Brakes still feel like crap. I'll have to
get together with some of the other Austin owners and get a consorted opinion
about the problem there.
