Yes, several people, all of whom reported figures which agree with the spec
book. No one else reports numbers like yours, Mr. Bonneville. You have a
mystery.

I shall.

The Weissach axle actually steers the rear tires a little. With very wide
tires, even a little departure from rolling straight ahead can make a big
change in the amount of side force the tire can generate, which could cause
the tire to lose grip and break loose, creating a much bigger problem than
that which the Weissach axle was built to correct.

Meanwhile, all I've heard suggests that this Weissach counterproductivity
shows up with really wide tires (too wide to fit under unmodified fenders;
e.g., 315+ mm section). Even the 285/30x18 rears Kim is excited about
probably don't need de-Weissachization.
