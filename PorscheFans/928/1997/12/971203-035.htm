Hi Sharkers!!
Just a post to inform:
Found for sale in Utah:
1982 Burgundy, Auto, 100k, butt-ugly BBS Gold basket wheels, interior
pulling away syndrome, engine runs but misses (probably) due to the
cracked spark wires, some RUST by the rear window trim.
Come to think of it, I can't remember if it was an 'S' or not, and I did
not drive it, but the small car lot it was at probably could be dealt
with.  They told me they got it back from a defaulted sale, and the bill
(loan) is $5k, and they would gladly do that.  I told the guy he was up
in the night, that I was looking for a track car, and he was "at least
$2000 too high". His response was "Well, what would you give for the
car?"

My thoughts are that with cash money (western expression), one could get
this for $2500-$3000.
Maybe not, but.  hmmmm.....

To the person looking for a "shell" to do that "Renegade Hybrid" kind of
thing to:  Plop down $3k, sell some/one of us the engine and extra parts
(for cheap of course!), and go to town!!

Thats MY $8.47 worth!!  (I did talk to this guy for a half hour, after
all!!)
