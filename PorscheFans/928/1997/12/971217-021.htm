Which one of you guys woke up the poor plastic model dealer in BC at 6:00
AM Pacific time to buy the Revell 79 928 for $8.00 US. I had the courtesy
to let the left coast wake up before I called. I guess courtesy doesn't get
you anywhere these days. I'll never make that mistake again. Merry
Christmas to the early bird.

How does that go...

....You snooze you looze.

Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to settle for the real thing for now.

Ladies and Gent's:

With much reluctance I have recently sold my cherished '87 S4, and I'm looking
for new homes for some leftover odds & ends:

*  One "stealth bra," a Colgan two-piece bra with sewn-in radar absorbent
liner.  Very good condition with one small curb rub.

*  One Wolfsport cotton car cover, light blue, good condition.

*  One contoured console mount for cell phone, black, purchased from Beverly
Hills Motoring Accessories, excellent condition.

*  One OE rear muffler, undamaged, approx. 60K miles use.

I'll accept the best offer for any or the lot.  Please e-mail me directly.
