"As for conspiracy theories, (I didn't know Oliver Stone drove a
928)...."

Ahhhh....one of my favorite observations.   How could we know the REAL
truth until Olly comes out with the movie?    Just think of the
mysteries to be solved:   What is the Identity of Deep Throat?;  What
Happened to The Knife (OJ trial)?; What Happened to Flight 800?; Who/Who
Wrote the Book of Love?; Where Did the Yeller Went?; The Mystery Blower,
etc.

"at least 6  companies manufactured cfc-12 (under different trademarks).
They
were DuPont Chemicals, Elf Atochem, Rhone Poulenc, ICI, Hoechst, and
Allied
Signal."

I vividly remember  buying a one pound can of Igloo brand Freon in
Chicago, six years ago, for .59 (on sale)!  DuPont had nothing to
protect price-wise.  It is dangerous to confuse business practice with
'conspiracy'.   Washington is crawling with people who's lives are spent
protecting interests.   It is a part of our system.  If anyone is still
awake in here, there is no point going into any more detail, other than
acknowledge that some will always find mystery to explain things -
overlooking that sometimes a rock is just a rock.

(Briskly slapping my face, trying to pull myself out of this
'seriousness' and back into my usual sarcastic demeanor - all the while
searching for scraps of shuttle heat shield material for possible flamer
protection)
