Another possibility on the flickering interior lights - on my '86S, the
switch on the hatch is "hair trigger", and a tiny movement of the hatch
causes the light to come on.

This sounds like a good possibility for mysterious flickerings, as
closing a door could move the hatch enough to turn the lights on, as
could hitting a bump.

You're right Leonard, got to be careful....

I was thinking when I wrote about superchargers that the Paxton unit was a
centrifugal type (seems I read this somewhere before), but I said what the
hell and wrote it anyway.  Most engine driven superchargers tend to be
positive displacement type (like Roots), but a few are like the Paxton....so
sorry.

Nevertheless, engine-driven vs. exhaust-driven CF types would have better
response because of the direct relationship of compressor speed with engine
speed, not having to also rely on throttle position (exhaust gas volume) to
make compressor revs.  Better response than a turbocharger, but not as good as
a Roots-type supercharger.

Again...so sorry for any mis-information.

Tom,

Actually, we're both partially right or both partially wrong as the case may
be.

You're right that the GT did come with the forged club sport wheels. That
would be the 1989 GT. These are the wheels that came on the euro only 1988 928
Club Sport as well as the 1988 944 Turbo S as you mentioned. I know these
wheels well since I've owned a 1988 944 Turbo S.
 
However, with model year 1990, the GT came standard with, and I quote from the
Porsche Service Information Technik '90 928S4 and 928GT (Publication No.
WKD496521), Code M400, Front: 7 1/2 J X 16 H2 ET65 cast rim in Design 90 and 
rear: 9 J X 16 H2 ET 52.3 cast rim in Design 90. These rims also contain the
two sensors for the Tire Pressure Control Unit (RDK).  The '90 928S4 came
with, and again quoting, Code M395 front: 7 J X 16 H2 ET forged rim in disc
design and rear: 8 J X 16 H2 ET 52.3 forged rim in disc design.

From a distance, the Club Sport and Design 90 rims look similiar. One way to
tell the difference is that the rim size and offset are cast into the wheel,
next to the tire valve on the design 90 wheels.  Also the spokes on the Club
Sport wheel terminate almost flush to the outside of the rim, while the Design
90 spokes terminate further inboard.
And yes, I believe that they are the same type of wheel (without the RDK) that
went on the C2/C4 and 944S2.

Any 90 GT owners care to confirm or deny?

Thanks for your response,

John Weber
