Thanks to everyone out there with the trailer info.  I guess I should have
given more information up front,  I wasn't trying to be secretive.  I tow my
928 race car to the tracks on the west coast in an enclosed trailer.  I have
been doing so with a chevy tahoe (with Porsche wheels).  I got to thinking
that the chevy had about the same torque and less horsepower as a stock S4
and the brakes are no where near as good. Why not tow with a 928?  After
talking to Kim Crumb, he faxed me info on the factory hitch.  It has a TUV
rating of 4200 lbs-not bad.  I got excited and went out and weighed my
trailer with all my spares.  Unfortunately it was 7200 lbs.  I think that
would be pushing things alittle too far.  Thanks again for all the response.
As a side note, my 928 was the fastest car at Laguna Seca this November with
the Porsche Owners club event.  We had 5 928's there and 80 other Porsches.
I posted lap times of 1:36.  Marc and Susan from Devek came by and I was
able to give Marc a quick ride on the track.  
Thanks again
