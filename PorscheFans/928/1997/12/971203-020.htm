I'm going to stick my nose in here and ask a stupid question.  What is
Magic Blower syndrome?

My only guess is that you're talking about why the fan speed changes when
you put in the clutch (remove load off the engine), brake, etc. especially
at night and cooler weather when you have the lights, radio, etc. on and it
seems to slow down the fan.  My guess about this, and it happens in most
cars I've seen, is that the alternator/battery can only supply so much
power for your electical equipment, and the fan is probably the item that
manufacturers can get away in reducing power to under those conditions.  It
would be dangerous to pull it away from lighting (although sometimes with
everything on they seem to dim just a touch in many cars), and customers
would complain if you took it away from the radio causing changes in
volume, etc. there.  The fan still runs, but just slower and this is about
the only thing that I can guess is the electrical load factor.
