Hello everyone,

I have been troling the 928 list for some time and would like to
introduce myself. My name is Carlos Amezcua and am the recent new 
(third) owner of a 87 5spd black/black 77k miles. There was complete 
service history from day one, interestingly the engine was rebuilt 
when tha car had 38k miles, and I mean major rebuild crankshat, camshafts, 
pistons, etc. The total bill was on the order of $12000, this was in 1991. 
The shop that did the work seems to be of high repute "Redline Service" 
in Santa Monica CA. From what I can make out of the invoice the problem 
seemed to be related to a "Failure in #6 connecting rod". The owner at the 
time stated in the invoice that a "noise" was coming from the engine. The 
labor alone was 66 hours at $65.00/hr (ouch!). Enough rambling about the 
past. I have already spent the it seems obligatory $1500.00 in initial 
maintenance (a/c, heater) problems in my case. The shop that I took the 
car to is called "Lomita 911 Service", the porsche mechanic there 
mentioned that he prefers working on 911's. So I have some questions

I need a reference to a shop for service hopefully that likes 928's. I live
on the Palos Verdes Peninsula about 14 miles south of LAX along the coast.
The neighboring cities are Torrance, San Pedro, Redondo Beach, Lomita.
Also in the area I need to find an alignment shop that is 928 friendly, I will
be needing new tires soon also.

If anyone would like to get together to talk cars, etc in the LA or OC 
basin let me know maybe something similar to micro-brew night.

BTW - Phil
One of the problems I had was sudden loss of coolant related to that hose
under the airbox. My problem was not the hose but the fitting that the
hose connects to on the engine block. This fitting on my car was 2 pieces,
one is a tiny tube pressed/bonded into the flange that bolts to the block.
In my case the tube came out of the flange. The Porsche replacement part
is a one piece fitting which is a much better design.

Thanks for putting up with this long winded message.
