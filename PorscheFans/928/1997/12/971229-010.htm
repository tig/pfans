Non-928 content (probably), but hey, you're all enough of a bunch of
loonies that
this might interest you too:

There's a 6000 mile, 9-day winter rally taking place in Feb, going
basically from
Seattle to Inuvik (300 miles NORTH of the Arctic circle) and back.  It's
a TSD
style rally, which means accuracy is more important than speed, but
there's
sufficiently insane sections that driving skill is very important.  On
the Telegraph
Creek section 2 years ago, 3 of the navigators took tranquilizers before
starting
(one-lane road....that's NOT one lane each way....2000+ foot dropoff to
the Stikine
River).  It makes the ALCAN 5000 look like a grocery-shopping trip.

I went as a worker (free hotels, no entry fee), timing sections and
taking photos 
for the Chicago Trib in 1996.  TONS of fun, esp. as a worker (pretty
stressful
as a competitor).  325ix won.  Highlights:

 - Liard Hot Springs (115F water, -25F air!)
 - 110.7mph in a 325ix on the Mackenzie River (which ISN'T straight!) in
Inuvik
 - eating musk ox, moose, caribou, arctic char
 - visiting Favron Mines in Dawson, and holding a 100 oz gold bar
 - destroying a Jeep Cherokee's transmission
 - renting a Ford Explorer at midnight in Whitehorse, forgetting to
mention that
   we were taking it on a rally

Some heavy-hitters coming this year, including Tom Grimshaw!  Bring
something
to be autographed.

Email me privately if this sort of lunacy appeals to you, and you want
more details.   

I'll be going again.
