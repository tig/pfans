You have to crawl under the car. With a 5-speed you have to pull the 
top plug and stick your finger inside if nothing comes out. The 
automatic has a plastic resevoir of some kind. I've only seen pictures.

Battery is under the spare tire. Gripe to the salesman if a Porsche
electric tire pump isn't back there too. Make sure its the right sized
battery, "group 42" from memory, its big. Should be a wide braid for
ground running to the chassis for ground under the rear tool panel. If
the battery is too small this braid will be too short, under tension,
preventing the battery cover from closing. Then sit the spare tire on
top to add more tension... not a pretty picture. Idiot PO did exactly
that to my car. Under the front hood, front right corner, is a terminal
for the positive jump. Negative goes to the chassis.
