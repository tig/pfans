One subscriber recently went to my home page
http://members.aol.com/KLeary928/index.html and asked me to explain the
story of BeerFrog Commits Suicide

The story of the Beer Frog Commits Suicide is as follows:

I live in sunny Gainesville, Florida.....home of the Gators. I have several
favorite country backroads where the smokey's rarely frequent thus allowing
me to occassionally explore the top end of my two 928's. One day I was out
testing my new Authorty chip, Borla exhaust and Eibach spring package on my
'86. Needless to say I was really moving along down a long flat deserted
stretch of road when I see something hopping across the road. 

When I got home I realized that a large leopard frog (aka the BeerFrog) was
trying to cross the road........he must have really taken one giant leap
for frogkind as he actually hit above the spoiler and was empaled on the
front fender.......his tounge fully extended (like the BeerFrog in the
first commercial)......and all of his insides splattered up the side
fender. I just could not believe BeerFrog's Air Jorden-esk elevation and
had to take a photo to support my incredible story........I left BeerFrog
empaled on the fender for about 3 or 4 days until I returned to the scene
of his demise........whereupon I again hit top end and gave BeerFrog a
final high speed send-off to the great beer keg in the sky.
