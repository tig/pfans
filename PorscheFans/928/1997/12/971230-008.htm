Jason,

I found that the best place for my CD changer was with two small screws
into the back of the rear seat.  I kept my original Reno face unit and used
a changer with the frequency input through the antenna.  I mounted this
unit on top of the fuse panel on the passenger side.  I mounted my amp on
the other side of the rear passenger seat with a Kicker substation sitting
in the back with the cargo net over the top to stop it from moving around.
I also mounted a Sony electronic crossover under the glove compartment for
better frequency separation.  I am very happy with the sound of this set up
and with the rear luggage cover over the top, it is also hard to see.  Hope
this helps.
