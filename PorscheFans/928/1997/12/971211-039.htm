Yes, but...

Let's sort out a few basic points, many of which have been addressed by
others on this list (noteworthily Messrs. Chabot, Hudgins, Reviel,
Smallwood, and Tong, in carefully alphabetical order).

- Boost: As Dr. Bob and others have pointed out, supercharging works by
putting more combustible stuff in each cylinder. An even more fundamental
way to increase the amount of stuff going into a cylinder is to enlarge the
cylinder. That's why people sooner or later consider boring (generally not
a very good idea on 928s due to the thin aluminum cylinder walls, though
89+ engines appear to have thicker walls and 968s came with 104 mm pistons,
enough extra bore to add about half a liter to a 928 engine) and/or
stroking (as practiced by Devek and others). However, since the amount of
combustible stuff in a cylinder is roughly proportional to the size of the
cylinder (see above) and the absolute pressure (prevailing atmospheric
pressure, 14.7 psi or 1 bar, plus boost), we can either leave the inside of
the engine alone (for a while; see below) and supercharge now (the
"bolt-on" approach, attractive because you don't open up the engine or make
any internal changes, both expensive propositions) or do what we want to
enlarge and speed up (each firing of a cylinder yields a certain amount of
energy; since power is the rate at which energy is delivered, raising the
maximum engine speed at which the engine works efficiently will raise power
in proportion) the engine in order to get a hypertrophied version of the
big V8 punch we all like, then add supercharging to get the really big
numbers.

- More boost:  Bolt-on supercharging has a sharp limit, set by two factors.
The more expensive one is the internal compression ratio of the engine. At
the 10+ to 1 characteristic of 928s, you get into dangerous territory for
pistons and head gaskets above 6 psi or so. As Dr. B. has explained, this
won't (can't) get you 45% increase but may get you 25-30%, meaning about
100 bhp, which ain't shabby. However, it also ain't enough for many of the
megalomaniacs among us, so the question of higher boost arises. To be safe,
you'll need to replace at least your pistons in order to bring down the
internal CR (around 8:1 should be safe even for huge boosts). To get any
results, you'll need, if you haven't done so already, to install an
intercooler. As boost increases, so does the temperature of the compressed
air leaving the supercharger, reducing its density. To maintain high
density, you must cool the compressed air. The best way (I summarily
disregard water injection and ultra-rich fuel mixtures) to do this is with
a radiator, called an intercooler, which conveys excess heat from the
compressed air en route to the engine either directly to outside air
(air-to-air, as seen in most turbo installations) or first to circulating
coolant (air-to-water), thence to air. If you don't intercool at low boost,
you'll need to budget for intercooling as well as internal engine mods when
you go to high boost.

Boost when?:  We've learned to hate turbochargers because of lag, so we're
interested in belt-driven superchargers. However, new, small turbos spool
up very quickly; some of them are at full boost below 2000 rpm. Most
positive-displacement superchargers are, too, but kinda crap out as the
revs rise (which is why they're popular in truck applications; in top fuel
dragsters, they're geared or pulleyed to work well at high engine speed,
but those vehicles don't try to work at low engine speed). Centrifugal
superchargers generally need to be spinning pretty fast to work well, so
they exhibit a rising torque augmentation with rising revs which isn't lag,
but has much of the same effect (poky until a certain speed, then watch
out), and I don't think this is what those of us who bought the big V8s in
the first place want; we're looking for augmentation across the entire
power band.

How (or when or if) boost?: This leaves us in a quandary. If we want more
of what we have now, the only straightforward way is...to get more of what
we have now, which means enlarging the engine and refining all the
refinables (e.g., gas flow in, gas flow out, valve timing, engine
management). This costs a lot of money and is difficult to make yield more
than 500-600 bhp (enough to get you over 200 mph, to push your drivetrain
pretty hard, and generally to get your attention), but these are "real"
ponies (even those who build forced aspiration systems will admit, if
pressed, that a blown engine needs to test 10-20% higher than an unblown
one to deliver the same performance) and come without any lag and with the
snappy throttle response basically only available with high internal
compression. If we want more power than that, or want to get a big
increment without opening up the engine or otherwise spending a lot of
money, belt-driven superchargers are simplest, but turbo installations
with, say, two small turbos and an intercooler may make no more (maybe even
less) difference in the personality of the engine. 

Bottom line? If budget is not an issue (ha!), build a bigger
normally-aspirated engine. When you've figured out how to use all that
output (500-600 "real" bhp), rebuild it again (primarily for lower internal
CR) and apply major boost with intercooling; this can take you into the
700-1000 bhp range, in which you'll need to look very closely at
drivetrain, wheels and tires, de-Weissachization (how could I not sneak
that in?), emissions testing (do you expect to get this thing legally on
the street?), and a few other matters having to do with your motives and
rationality.

If budget is an issue, start with bolt-on forced induction. A
non-intercooled belt-driven supercharger installation is the simplest, but
you'll need to choose the compressor technology (centrifugal v. positive
displacement) and drive ratio to put the torque augmentation in the rev
range where you want it.

A single- or twin-turbo installation with small turbos and an intercooler
will cost more (because of the intercooler and the necessary exhaust
plumbing to drive the turbos), but will give you more power (courtesy of
the intercooler, which may also let you run a little more boost, which will
give yet more power) may actually do a better job of preserving that big V8
character.

What am I doing? Giving the whole matter very serious consideration. Every
time I get significantly more power, it's exciting, even scary. As I learn
to use it, it remains fun, but the itch for more returns. I don't know
where this process stops, so I don't know how much is too much. However, I
don't want to lose my car's exquisite balance, I don't want to get sucked
(no pun intended) into a wide-open R&D situation, and I get uneasy with
extremely expensive programs of modification (gotta have good bang for the
buck). Your mileage (and motives) may vary.
