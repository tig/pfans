>I'm interested in buying some books on 928 you have recently talked
>about:

>1. 'The 928 Performance Portfolio'
>2. 'Porsche 928 GTS'
>3. 'Illustrated Porsche Buyers Guide'

>How can I reach these books/booksellers via Internet?

Classic motorbooks can get you all three as far as I know.  They have all
been advertised there.  They're at www.motorbooks.com on the Web.  You may
also want to check out www.amazon.com, the world's largest bookstore.

>Can they ship to Europe?

Motorbooks can ship overseas.
I would also guess amazon.com can as well.

Any information on good European (maybe German) 928 books?

No info there, but I haven't really checked at amazon.com.

>Also, any suggestions where I can get information and pictures of 928
>cabrio?

Have you been to www.928s4vr.com ?  There's a few shots of one there.

>Thanks in advance.
>Greetings (for the first time) from Croatia.
>(Some of us over here also adore 928!)

>Davor

How is it over there?  Its getting downright chilly around here, but I
kinda like sunny and 70 degress F myself.
