Fact, smact. Its conjecture. DuPont fought fhe CFC regulations tooth =

and nail.

Am sure with a little web surfing one could pinpoint the date of the =

invention of R-12. But for a quickie there is a table of properties of =

Dichlorodiflouromethane (Freon-12) in my "CRC Handbook of Chemistry and =

Physics, 47th edition". Copyright 1966.

If a patent was issued in 1966 for Freon-12 then 1966 + 17 years =3D 1983=
=2E

http://www.dupont.com/teflon/100.html says:
The story of Teflon=AE began April 6, 1938, at DuPont's Jackson Laborator=
y
in New Jersey. DuPont chemist, Dr. Roy J. Plunkett, was working with
gases related to Freon=AE refrigerants, another DuPont product.

http://www.dupont.com/corp/gbl-company/history.html says Freon =

refrigerants line was introduced in 1931. Couldn't find the origin date =

for Freon-12, but how long would it take to get up to the number 12? =

And what were the 11 before it? Couldn't find that list either, its =

probably in my Thermo text at work. Would guess at least one "Freon" is =

plain ammonia.

The human mind ordinarily operates at only ten percent of its
capacity -- the rest is overhead for the operating system.
