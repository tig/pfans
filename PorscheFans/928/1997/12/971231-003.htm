In a limited drive of about 1 hour ( to auto-x site ) and 4 runs on
the course, the following come to mind.
Quality- I'd vote for the SC400, this is a very " slick " machine.
         controls, paint, fabrics all seem 1st. class.
Ride- SC400 was softer, very quiet, more isolated.

Handling- my 85 5-speed seems much more balanced. The SC400 had
          lots of understeer & brakes did not seem as strong.
          SC400 seemed much softer in transitions.
Engine- SC400 very smooth but the later model 928's have way more
        power.
If you value a smooth silent ride go for the SC400. If you want
something exciting to drive, with great overall performance get
a late model 928 with a 5-speed.
