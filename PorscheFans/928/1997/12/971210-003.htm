I called Paxton in CA and had a nice lady tell me "We don't make a kit for
that model, it would be a custom job, $5k+" and then she told me about
Superchargers of Knoxville and gave me the number, called them, same story,
only I was quoted $7k+.

But yes, my guess is that this list generated quite a few calls to both
places.  Seems to me that with 928+ members to this list that we could
generate some business for whoever put a kit together.

For $4k (kit estimate) you get 45% increase in hp and torque at only 5%
boost with no other mods required . . . sold!

Gene, Your anger is misplaced.  The poor fellow merely did what one does on
these lists... send a post.  The problem lies with the lousy software on the
list server.  It's not Jeroan's fault.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bob: agreed.  That said, we still get to tease the poor guy without mercy or
remorse!

Guys (and girls):  Need some help about the 4-speed auto trans.

I've been reviewing the shop manual and re-reading the owner's manual, but I
can't find any info describing the correct operation of the auto trans with
regard to shifting strategy.  Maybe those who have autos can help me.

In D or 3, my 928 always starts out in 2nd gear from a stop, unless I put my
foot to the floor and engage the kickdown switch, and then it starts out in
1st, as you would expect.  Shifting is as expected, with the shift points (up
and down) varying with the amount of applied throttle.  Kickdowns also work as
described, depending on road speed.

When the selector is placed in 2, my 928 always starts out in 1st gear and
stays in 1st until redline regardless of throttle pressure.  I can use light
throttle pressure and cruise around in 1st, or keep my foot in it....but it
stays in 1st until it hits the redline.  At that point, it shifts into 2nd and
then I can let up on the throttle and it will stay in 2nd until I slow to
around 10mph when it will downshift back into 1st.  If I engage the kickdown,
it will shift into 1st at a higher rpm, of course.

Quite some time ago, I had a friend drive the car and he told me that typical
4-speed autos are designed to start out in 2nd unless the throttle is floored.
I accepted that explanation, and forgot about the whole thing until recent
list postings about auto shift kits had me wondering about how the 928's auto
transmission is supposed to work.  As I mentioned in the beginning, reviewing
the shop and owner's manuals didn't help.  In fact, I might conclude from
reading these manuals that the transmission should start out in 1st gear (at
least sometime).

What do you think it should do??
