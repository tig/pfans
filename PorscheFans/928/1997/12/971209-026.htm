It should be pretty straight forward to check the fuel pump at least. The 
pumps in 928's tend to be quite audible so your first clue would be the 
whine it makes or the lack there of. It only runs when the engine is 
running or cranking so get someone else to crank it while you listen. If 
you hear no sound its either no volts to the pump or a bad pump. If you 
have a meter take off the cover that covers the pump and fuel filter and 
see if the pump is getting volts, when cranking don't forget. If it is 
and you have no sound you have a bad pump. If not the next candidate 
would be the fuel pump relay I would think. If you don't have a meter (I 
can't imagine anyone who owns a 928 not having one) the first thing you 
could try is jumping the relay. If this solves your problem your fault is 
probably the relay or the computer. If it doesn't, those two items are 
probably OK. I use the word probably as wiring is always a possibility. 
Didn't the dealer suggest a ground problem? As a final test of the pump 
you could disconnect the wires to it and feed it directly from the 
battery. Some caution is required here though. One, disconnect the 
battery when moving wires around. This is especially prudent given the 
area your working in. Two, I would make up a fused cable, say 5 amps, 
with the fuse physically at the battery end of the cable to make this 
test, shorted batteries can ruin your day. Three, wrap some insulating 
tape around the wires you have disconnected. Four, pay attention to 
polarity. My pump is marked and the terminals are a different size so the 
wires will only go back one way. Five, if you don't feel comfortable 
doing this, don't. If the pump runs when you direct connect it but didn't 
when you jumped the relay, you probably have a wiring problem. You did 
check the fuse I assume.

Your comment about the injectors noise reminded me about a neighbor who 
commented about "the noisy lifters". 8 injectors all firing at the same 
time definitely click.

Good luck

Colin
