John,

I woudn't touch that deal with the proverbial ten foot pole, even if you =
can determine without a doubt that the car really does have only 19,000 =
miles on it.  If the car hasn't been used for years, its' loaded from =
end to end with dried out seals, hoses, gaskets, wire insulation, etc.  =
It could wind up costing you as much as an early 90s GTS.  If you wanted =
to sell it after a short while, a dealer will offer you about one fourth =
of the $20,000 you paid for it. =20

You have to understand how dealers look at cars in general.  To them a =
1983 car is a 1983 car.  The fact that it only has 19000 miles on it =
doesn't mean a hell of a lot to them.  They mostly go by that week's =
black book and if a fifteen year old  car has real low mileage maybe it =
will be worth a few hundred dollars more. =20

I dabbled in the exotic car business as a sideline for a few years back =
around 90-93.  It was a hell of an education.  Unlike most of the =
members of this group, myself included, who tend to romanticize 928s and =
other great cars;  to the average dealer, its' just another hunk of iron =
to be disposed of as quickly as possible for whatever the traffic will =
bear.

If you shop around you can probably get a pretty decent 89 with a =
reasonable amount of mileage on it for that same $20,000 this guy wants =
for his 83.
