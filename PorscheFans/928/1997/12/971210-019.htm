To all those looking into blowers,

I talked to Vortech tech support last night EST. They have a centrifugal
belt drive unit (V1-S trim) that is suited to 4.5-5.5 liter applications
that can provide boost in the 5-17 psi range. You would get different
boosts with different pulley selections. For a 9:1 compression engine they
said that you could get a virtual 13.1:1 compression ratio at peak with
about 8 psi boost. The unit is $1800 US (Devek cams run $2k alone). Whom so
ever wished to undertake an endeavor of this sort would have to figure out
brackets, intake and air filter mods, drive pulley arrangement, and
possibly a waste gate to keep street drivability. Someone mentioned a
detonation sensor or feedback loop and their techies said that they have
those sorts of control components for serious engine builders (ie... mass
flow and fuel management stuff). They said with moderate boost that no
engine mods should be necessary but that those who already have high
compression engines should beware of high boost settings. I've heard that
you can make a blast furnace out of your cylinders with excessive boost.

Assuming you have an early car and you get the 40-50% increase in
horsepower that Vortech claims you could get 220-240 horses up to 308 to
360 (that's best and worst cases). These are good numbers to me. I'm saving
my pennies for a blower. Any one else have an opinion? 

For now I will enjoy my Weissach rear ended, skinny tired, non- s4 braked,
old shark. I know you guys with the super trick, 4 valve, fat tired guys
think I can't be having any fun but this car still scares the hell out of
me when I drive it on twisty back roads in Vermont. Yeehaw!

later...
