I'm not a lawyer, but my degree is Criminal Justice and thus I've had
several classes in law, and heard plenty of stories.

That would probably be considered a booby trap and get you in trouble.  A
couple in this area was having their place broken into through the same
window everytime.  They setup a 12 gauge shotgun at knee height through
that window, and when he came a knockin, he got both knee caps blasted off.
 Because of the screwball justice system, he got off scott-free and they
got in trouble for a booby trap, assault, and all kinds of other trouble,
not to mention being sued.  Too bad all states don't have laws like Texas
that allow you to protect your property with force, like a .50 caliber
Desert Eagle.  Maybe a slow working, hard to detect poison would be best.
Kinda like some of these bug killers, they come in and leave, but they
don't get away.  That would make sure it was their last hit, but make sure
you have a couple of those 150 db alarms in your car.  You could probably
do that safely and not mess up your interior.  If the criminal is stupid
enough to get in your car where the alarm is going off and he goes deaf,
who's to care.  Just make sure they're hidden and have their own power
supplies.  You probably couldn't walk into that noise, it'd hit you like a
brick wall.  Especially if you can tune the sound and do so until you feel
dizzy when you hear it at low levels.  Disrupt the inner ear fluid, and
they'd probably be laying on the ground listening to it when you arrived.
A nice sticker on the outside stating that an alarm is active that will
sound would be a nice statement to remove any liability.  Besides,
chemicals agents would get all over your car and some could be quite
difficult to clean up.

The fuel cut is a great idea with an ignition kill, and then they won't be
able to do anything with it.  Unless they came armed with a tow truck.
Let's face it, they're gonna get it if they really, really want it, whether
its a Passat or a McLaren.  You just gotta deter those little weiners that
are much more prevalent than the true pros.
