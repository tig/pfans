yippee!

Thank God my 'steaming GT' was due to a failed hose.  The same one that
failed on the '84 too, so all you owners should pull your airboxes and
check the hoses underneath, especially that short little sucker.  I had
some double-walled hose leftover from last time so with a snip it was
in.

So that's the good news.  The sort of bad news is some of the other
hoses felt a might squishy and should be replaced too.  Of course they
are in the worst place (through firewall, etc.) so maybe I can bolster
this false sense of security with some tape or heat shielding for now.

I will definately get to all the other reachable ones that Lucky didn't
replace yet...

And BTW, got word from Susan that he can't make out for this friday's
dinner, drats!  But we will still have a good time! 

Jim, can I have my test CD back! (Will probably go to Marc next to
excercise that Krell of his :)  (ps. have you fried any speakers yet?)

Huckleberry I still have your box of goodies which is now your Xmas
present!

Anyone see the 928 S vs. Corvette race on cable movie last night (TMC)? 
Pretty lame movie but nice shot of 928 emerging from wet aquaduct!

I heard CEC opened a showroom in L.A. (Century City)- but do they care
about us anymore?

Not even one guess on challenge #4 still! 

6 days to Christmas...
