Well now I have to relay my 928 cooling story.

Whilst driving from Atlanta to Houston many moons ago,  I noticed the=20
temp gauge creeping up from the first hash mark (it's normal place) to=20
just above that mark over the course of a couple of hours.  Since, the=20
temp outside was around 35 degrees F. and climbing I didn't think must=20
of it; until I stopped at a gas station.  When I decelerated, the temp=20
gauge rose well into the 3rd quadrant quickly and the warning lamp=20
came on.  I immediately pulled over and observed steam coming from a=20
small hole at the bottom of the radiator.  "I thought I was gonna=20
die!"   But then, I remembered an old Chevy trick used on more than=20
one occasion.  I refilled the system and checked for the leak rate.=20
 It was very slow.  So I put the radiator cap back on but didn't=20
tighten it down so the system would circulate water but wouldn't build=20
pressure.  I kept a keen eye on the temp gauge, which always stayed on=20
the third hash mark, and topped off the system every 100 miles or so.=20
 I successfully completed the last 500 miles of that trip without=20
incident to me or the car.

I empirically learned a couple of things that day:

1) 928 engines will remain cool if the temperature outside is low=20
enough and there's enough air moving into the engine bay while=20
driving.

2)	The "Chevy Trick" works on 928s as well as old Chevy trucks.

3)	Don't Panic if you're 500+ miles from home and a problem arises.=20
 Just say a quick prayer and approach the situation logically.

Bert

Now, some of us have had cooling systems that leak a bit, and have=20
seen the coolant warning come on when the car is started from cold=20
when it gets down a pint or so. So you may be tempted to drive a few=20
miles more, to a more convenient stopping place, if the light comes on=20
while you're underway. The message at the Tech Session was "Don't do=20
it! Stop and check right now, or you and your bank account may be very=20
sorry."
At least it gave us a nice engine to explore at the Tech Session, but=20
I doubt that that's much solace to the owner.
