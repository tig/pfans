Warning - this could well be one of those rambling "I love my car" posts, but
I feel that this is probably the most appropriate place for it...

I got a book for Christmas.  It's by motoring journalist and "Top Gear" presenter
Jeremy Clarkson and it's called "100 Great Cars That Make You Go 'Phwoar!'".
It's pictorial, with very few stats or figures and lots of REALLY amusing text.
The Porsche pages have a 944 Turbo on the left and a 928 on the right, and the
text opens: "No, don't go turning the page looking for it. It's not here. I don't LIKE 
the 911..."

I read all 140 pages of it in bed this morning and after all his waxing lyrical about
Astons, Jaguars (the XJR) and Ferraris I just HAD to bring the shark to work.  It's
a Saturday morning here in NZ, in the middle of the Christmas / New Year week
where the whole country basically shuts down.  The motorway traffic was heavy
and frustrating - carloads of children and dogs with bikes stuck all over the outside,
heading out of Auckland for some summer recreation.  Three lanes of mobile
play-pens with excitable infants and stressed-looking parents. ("Are we nearly
there, Dad?  Can we have McDonalds?  Joey's pulling my hair!"...  I remember
it too well.)

The streets around the office were a different story.  Wide, smooth roads normally
full of courier vans and light trucks, deliciously empty and inviting.  And the 928
just roared and howled through the pack of Penrose... the engine noise bouncing
off empty office blocks and warehouses, the tyres shreiking and smoking through
right-angle turns.  Into a side-street in second gear with 50 mph showing, hard on
the gas forcing the rear to break away in a Hollywood-style oversteer that made
me wish someone was watching.  The ABS making its presence felt as I left it
until the last second and beyond to pull the speed down for the next intersection.

And then the same thing again, just as fast, just as loud.  The gentle curves that
I don't even notice as curves in the Peugeot during the year became challenging
chicanes.  The tail stepping out under braking, but a good spin of the wheel
convincing it to get the hell back where it belongs and throw the car at the next
corner.

It was only a precious few minutes, and it really wasn't the Porsche in its
element - it's an open-road distance gobbler, remember - but it was as much
fun as I could have had in my Lotus Seven in the same place, and that's ALL
the Seven does - no 150+ mph comfort in that!  

I love this car.
