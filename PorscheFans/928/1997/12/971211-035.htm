Hey,

I knew there was a couple of other movies I'd seen with 928s in them, but I
just couldn't remember them for a bit.

Speed Zone (S4 for a few moments)

and the best I've seen is.......

Banzai Runner

Its a cool movie about street racers and a cop that must stop the head bad
guy who runs a modded 928 with a body kit on it (except when they're racing
for some reason :)  Really cool shots of the car zooming along, and it
doesn't get trashed in the movie.  There's also a 308, and a Pantera that
races the 928.  Also, a 911 Turbo races it as well.  I won't give out any
spoilers in case you all are interested in the movie.  I got my cousin to
make me a copy of the film when it was playing on cable.

Maybe you mentioned it, but I didn't remember seeing it listed....

I'm going to have to check out some of those others.

Andrew
