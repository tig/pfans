Ed and Stephanie are right, Larry Reynolds is the man and doesn't try to
sell you more than you need, Blitz wax outperforms Zymol for less money.
 Use 3M Imperial Hand Glaze after getting your paint super clean and
slick, then wax.  E mail me at eric.hoffman@hboc.com if you'd like to
hear about paint cleaning clay to get paint aforementioned clean and
slick.  Larry recommends Sonax wash, try it and you'll see why.  I
personally mix it with McGuire's wash due to cost.  A sheepskin wash mit
has fantastic dirt absorbing ability, rinse frequently during washing.

Second, I noticed Ed Wolfe's experience with tires, I believe for sheer
cost effective goodness you can't beat Yokahama 509's and Bridgestone
Potenza RE71 (I think that's the number, whatever the cheapest ones
are).  I'm assuming you were attracted to D40M2's in the first place
because of cost.  Japanese tires rock!  I went from Michelin XGTZR4 to
Yokahama 509's with no percetable difference and the Yoky's were like
$110 for 245 45 16from Tire Rack.  Cheapy weapy.  I've not had any
experience with Firestone tires but have with their service centers and
cannot afford the therapy to discuss it...
