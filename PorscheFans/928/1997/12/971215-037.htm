Well, to my knowlege, there is no good quality die cast model of a 928
that exists.  Several 928 models are made by Solido but are of poor
quality.  Minichamps makes fine models of Porsche cars but they do not
offer any 928.  Your best bet is to hunt down a Tamiya 928S model kit
that is no longer in production (great detail).  Fujimi also makes a kit
that's looks great but with no engine detail/suspension.  Herpa makes
pretty good HO scale models of various 928s but they are very small
(high quality).  If you find out anything more, please let me know.
