Why lower it before draining? I have (4) "ramps" made of two 2"x8"
boards, stacked. My ramps are short enough to go under the car yet tall
enough to change the oil filter once the car is up.

Place one before each wheel. Back up a bit. Charge forward. And brake
after the 2nd bump. Its a bit of a challenge as all 4 wheels have to 
bump up the 1-1/2" board thickness at the same time.

When all 4 corners are up, the car is properly level for draining and 
filling oil.

What is the best wax, car wash, and leather conditioner for my 928?
I have been told Zymol is the best wax and leather conditioner. Any truth?
What is recommended for the dashboard?

On another note: Has anyone had any luck with RainX?  I read the bottle and
like what it said, if it works.  I wonder if I can get it off if I do not like
the it.

Does anyone use the special window cleaner reservoir?  Is it worth filling-up?
