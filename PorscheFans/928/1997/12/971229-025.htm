Darn it, Gene...you only have three newlines in your whole post! :-)
Please pardon the reformatting.

See, I told you, James. Nobody likes these crummy D40M2s we're using. :-)

My D40s aren't terribly noisy, but traction -- wet or dry -- is pretty
pitiful. The SP 8000s were excellent, but the model number must indicate
life expectancy because I was only able to get 8000 miles out of the
rears. Since then I've backed down from 44 psi.

I plan to try out the Firestone SZ50s when the fronts need replacing
again. The old Firestone SZ was easily the worst performance tire I've
ever used, but word on the street is that SZ50s are much improved and
have a much longer tread life. I've seen more than one Boxster with them
so they may even be OEM (but what do I care...er, know).
