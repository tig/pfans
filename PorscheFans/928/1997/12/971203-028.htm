Fellow 928'ers,

I am posting this for the whole list, hoping to hear some advice. I've got an
'88 S4, which I have driven almost everyday for the last two years with not a
problem whatsoever (needless to say, I love the car), until this unfortunate
mishap... Anyways, this is how my predicament started:

As I was re-accelerating after taking a corner turn, I noticed all of a sudden
some engine roughness and unevenness, typical of a cylinder misfiring. This
was, of course, accompanied of noticeable loss of power, but the car was still
derivable. I kept driving it that way for a few days until I decided it was
time to do something about it... While checking things around in the engine
compartment I discovered that, on the cylinder closest to the passenger seat
(looking at the car from the front, the deepest one on the left bank), the plug
of the wire connector was a little popped out from the spark plug cavity. After
trying unsuccessfully to gently push it back into place I decided to try and
check the spark plug itself... As I put the wrench in place, it felt as if the
spark plug were pretty loose (which made sense according to my initial theory
that the spark plug was unscrewed, perhaps due to vibration, causing some
leakage of combustion gases, thus making the connector plug pop out from the
cavity). I sadly discovered that what I got in the wrench socket was only part
of the spark plug (the nut, plus the upper part). That is, the spark plug broke
right underneath the nut leaving the threaded part behind. Checking the ceramic
fracture surface, it was clear that the breaking had happened some time before,
perhaps at the time that I felt the engine roughness for the first time.  What
probably caused the problem in its very beginning was the guy who installed the
spark plugs, grossly over-torquing that particular spark plug (this is also
supported by the fact that the nut itself came out totally loose from the rest
of the spark plug body).

At any rate, right now I am faced with the problem of cleanly extracting the
bottom half of the spark plug without causing further damage. I have had people
suggesting for me to use an "easy-out" kind of tool. However, as most of you
know, access to that point is severely limited due to the depth of the spark
plug cavity (about 6 inches!!). Additionally, using an easy-out will most
likely cause some little pieces of the ceramic to fall into the combustion
chamber!!.

Can somebody please comment or give me any pointers on how to fix this problem?
I would truly appreciate it.
