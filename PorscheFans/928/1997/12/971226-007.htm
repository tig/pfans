Well my car is now Minden Silver Pearl and has a Strosek wing on it.. And
I'd have to say it looks pretty damn good. Aside from the expected dead
battery, I had a problem with it when I was bringing it home. (Ok I didnt
bring it home.. I drove it about 150 miles round trip up the coast and
back.. hey I havent driven it for a couple of months!)

Anyway, I heard the telltale signs of some failing bearings in one of my
pumps, much too late (about the farthest point away from my house or my
mechanic...) and by the time I was getting off the freeway I threw a belt.
The pump that seems to be seized is on the passenger side on top. The belt
went around the crank pulley, the main fan, and the this device... So my
question is, what is it? I started it and watched the temp sensor like a
hawk and it climbed slightly higher than normal, but didnt seem to try to
overheat, so I took it on a short trip on the freeway and the temp dropped
a little... I am imagining this must mean its that air pump that goes into
the exhaust? If thats true, where is my water pump? Is it under that
plastic cover on the front of my block?

PS - I'm not a mechanic, and Im not going to try and fix it myself. But it
will be a week before i get it into the shop and until then I will be
scratching my head wondering whats broke. :)

should be)
