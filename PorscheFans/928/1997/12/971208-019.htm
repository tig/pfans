To some kind soul out there

Sam Herrin asked about the best way to fix cracked dashes...

I've got the same problem (as do many others).  Dash replacement is very
expensive...I was quoted well in excess of $1500 by a dealer (lots of work
involved).  I've decided to attempt a low-cost fix which MIGHT be
satisfactory...we'll have to wait and see.

Basically I decided to cover it up with one of the plastic dash covers sold by
many sources such as Automotion, Performance Products, etc.  Since my dash is
blue, and the covers come only in black, instead of using the entire cover I
plan on cutting out a narrow oval to include the vents themselves and maybe an
inch or so of border around the vents.  I will probably place a thin rubber U-
shaped trim gasket all along the cut edge of my oval dash cover strip.  Then I
will fasten it to the existing dash with the silicone glue which comes with
the dash cover kit.  If everything works as I hope it does, the black oval
will cover up the cracks between the vents and look like a black trim piece
rather than an obvious cover.  After all, lots of trim pieces are black, even
though the car has a blue interior.  The cover, on sale, was only about
$55....so I think it's worth the attempt.  Of course, if it doesn't look good,
I'll remove the dash myself and try to have it fixed by a dash repair
specialist (easily found in Hemmings).  But that's a bridge (of many) that
I'll cross when I come to it.  You may want to think about this approach.
