You should have informed the current owner of the car and the police as 
there are laws in most places against altering the odometer reading. 
You have a strong case.

If the current owner didn't change the odometer then he has a case 
against the dealer and/or the prior owner. If you don't persue this 
kind of thing it will continue and the value of used cars will be less 
for the uncertianty it causes.

Shady used car dealers have huge influence on lawmakers, however. 
Alabama title transfers have a box to check, "certified odometer is 
accurate", and a signature line. By this, I mean the odometer is now 
presumed to be wrong unless that line is completed. You know the dealer 
isn't going to tell *that* to a customer.
