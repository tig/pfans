No differences in the transmissions.     The overhaul may not have included
both the operating sleeves and the dog teeth, both of which get dulled
over time and can contribute to balky shifting.    If everything else is
working normally, you might just have to live with it.

On the other hand, I overhauled a 79 a couple of years ago, and replaced
EVERYTHING that involves synchronization.   Yet when I test drove the
car, second gear was VERY stiff going in and out.    If you know anything 
about how these transmission are built, you will know that they are as
simple as a box of rocks and it simply isn't possible to make serious 
mistakes and still be able to get the shafts back together.   Nonetheless,
the problem started as a result of the rebuild.

I redid the job, replacing the syncro rings, but nothing else,  because I
could see NO wear anywhere.    When I got the box back in the car,
the hard shifting was now in THIRD gear.    So what was wrong?  
The only common part between second and third was the operating
sleeve, which had been replaced.    When I went in the THIRD time,
I measured the inside diameter of the 2-3 operating sleeve and found
that it had been manufactured undersized on one side.    It was then
easy to conclude that I had reversed it during the second rebuild,
transferring the problem from one gear to another.    

Maybe this is your problem . . . that there is a whole population of bad
operating sleeves out there.    I would think so, since I got one and these
things aren't handmade.   

Good luck.

Dave
