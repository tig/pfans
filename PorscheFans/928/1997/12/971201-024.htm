Rob,

Although I'm not a metallurgist, I'm a mechanical engineer who's had to
design aircraft components to meet military dissimiliar metal specifications.
FWIW, here's my $.02.
As has been stated, the galvanic effect happens when metals of different
galvanic potential (EMF) are in contact with each other and a mechanism
(water) for electrolysis to occur is present. The metal with the higher EMF
acts as a cathode and the lower (more negative) the anode. Electrons migrate
from the anode to the cathode, decaying the anode. Or do I have that
reversed?
The ways to prevent this are: 1)keep the potenital(EMF) of the two materials
close or 2)electrically insulate the two materials, preventing the electrons
from flowing. The later is used frequently on aluminium by anodizing it. That
process creates aluminium oxide which is an electrical insulator. 
The EMF's for some common materials run from gold at 0.15 Volts to Magnesium
at -1.60 Volts.
My guesses on your questions:
1) The dip process is applied to the metal after it is installed. I believe
they dip the entire chassis. There is a process (the name escapes me) that
applies the zinc to sheet metal before it's formed. Computer chassis are a
common use for that. It is scraped of a little, but it's cheaper and the
computer sees a fairly benign environment. 
2)Large removal of the zinc could jeopardize the steel. With small removals,
the zinc can actually reprotect through electrolysis. Also painting the steel
will act as a good protective plating
3)Yes, all different metals will have a galvanic potential. The question is
how much. The mil-specs state a difference of about .25 Volts requires
special consideration. Zinc is -1.05Volts and low alloy steels runs about
-0.70 depending upon alloy. That's how scratched zinc plated steel can "heal"
itself. Aluminium is about -.80. That is close to steel, but steel has to be
protected from oxidizing (rusting) so it's usually plated or painted or ????.
I would think(hope) the factory has taken some  measures to either close that
potential or electrically insulate the joint or ????. 

As you can tell, this is a long and boring subject and I barely understand
it, but I hope that helped.
