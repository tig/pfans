Oh my Lord!!!  How can ANYONE..,  spend 25k on some meaningless piece of
transportation when they can own world class everything!  I am still
learning the intricacies of this machine but I know I am way out of my
league in my abilities as compared to the cars potential.  I was reading
Car & Driver and am looking at what they consider the 10 best cars to own=
, =

I look at the prices,  the performance,  the soul that those vehicles do
NOT possess and I wonder....  On the other hand,  can you guys get me
acquainted with a couple of issues.  My temp gauge always hovers from dea=
d
center (after the car warms up) to the next hash mark but never going ove=
r
it.  Is that normal?  Also,  my voltmeter also hovers (during the day) fr=
om
dead center to right below 14.  At night it never drops below 12.  The
needle will once in a while jiggle like a miniature energy spike. Is that=

normal?  And last but not least,  the engine is silky smooth at 2250rpm's=

and above, ( I know Leonard, it should always be above 2500) but between
1200-2250 it is a little rough.  I do a fair amount of city driving so I
was just wondering if that is normal for it to be  a bit rough in that
range.  It idles perfect with an occasional rumble.  Let me know what you=
r
experiences are.  I am completely in love though with this machine.    Al=
