For the first time in the 4+ years I've owned my '85 928, I thought
something major had gone wrong with it.  It died on me shortly after
starting and would not re-start.  I thought I had either lost the LH unit
or slipped a tooth on the timing belt because it sounded so sick when
cranking.  However, thanks to help from Susan Kirby (of Devek) and Mark
(Mr928) Anderson (of 928 International), I checked my fuel injection system
and found the FI relay was not making good contact in the fuse panel.

Don't let anybody tell you these aren't tough cars!  I cranked on that
thing for over a minute, non-stop, as it slowly started making one pop,
then another, then coughed and sputtered and dropped back to cranking and
then with a couple of pumps of the go pedal, it choked to life with gobs of
smoke pouring out the door of my garage.  My neighbors must have thought
the house was on fire.  I had occasionally treated them to the roar of the
V-8's exhaust and they got a real earful this afternoon.  Man, what a
sound!  No garage queen, this car.  The floor of the room above my garage
literally vibrates from the sound of that engine idling below.

Thanks to all who helped steer me in the right direction.
