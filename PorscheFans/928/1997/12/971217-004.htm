Re:  Tires

I bought my 928 last Spring with 36000 miles on it.  I knew that the tires
were going to need replacing before the year was out, and since I was
planning a long trip in the fall, I replaced the existing tires with Dunlop
Sport 4000 all around in September.  These tires are Z-rated and "all
season", which is necessary for downeast Maine for fall and spring driving.

Last weekend my friend and I went to Massachusetts in the car, returning on
Sunday.  A strong front was moving through the area, with snow showers, high
winds and dropping temperatures.  Once off the interstate for the last
hundred miles, the roads were VERY slick in places.  Road crews were sanding
and salting.

Actually, the 928 did extremely well, although some things were quite
apparent.  First of all, I would never try to use the 928 as my main
transportation north of the snow belt.  The car happily reminded me that it
would take very little to make it do a dipsy-doodle, so VERY light throttle
input was the order, and on uneven rural roads, coming over a crest onto a
reverse camber curve....well, I had no problem, but could have.

The tires were excellent, and short of true winter tires on narrower wheels
were probably the best choice for the money that I could have made.  Best
news is that I can drive the 928 all winter, on good days, and not worry
about getting caught in a sudden squall, provided I remember to be VERY careful.

For the guy who just bought his 928 in DC....my advice is to buy four tires,
make'em all season type, and don't drive the car when it is going to be
really nasty.  I think that the 928 is very stable generally, but it is
heavy, and once it goes on ice, it will really chase its tail.

Good luck!
