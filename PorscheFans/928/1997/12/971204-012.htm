Ken:
concerning your inspections in the Houston area, i recently purchased my =
car at Momentum BMW.  Before purchasing the car, i brought it over to =
Don McGill.  They did a visual inspection of the car only.  I ended up =
working a one-year Porsche warranty out to be included w/my deal, so it =
wasnt that much of an issue.  I recommend the full inspection though.  =
The dealer was able to give me info on where the last service was for my =
car (cam belt, etc.).  I called PCNA and they gave me some history also. =
 Ultimately i was able to locate full records from Don McGill.  I just =
asked them for it.  It seems odd that they would not do it for you, =
since they may receive some of your business in the future.
I hear that one great Porsche shop in town is called Koby's.  Just make =
sure that wherever you go, they do have a "928" mechanic.
