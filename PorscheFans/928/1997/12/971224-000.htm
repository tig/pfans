RE:  Oil type and 928 consumption levels

I've been using Castrol Syntec 5-50 for over two years now in all of my
cars, and its broad spectrum in this Canadian climate has worked out very
well.  In a combination of both road & track driving, my 32 valve '85 928S
burns less than half a litre of oil between 8000 km [5000 mile] oil and
filter changes, and this is with an engine that now has 122,000 km [76,000
miles] on it - and my experience on my three other automobiles has been
exactly the same.  Although I've no wish to start another round of Red Line
vs Castrol letters with Michael, it's been my experience that Castrol makes
a really fine product.  In fact, I've written to the engineers at Castrol
to see if they can provide any indpendent documentation [SAE papers, for
example] on the relative high-temperature non-shearability of different
broad spectrum synthetics.  If and when I get a reply, I'll post it here.

In the mean time, my '28 sleeps safely in a quonset, waiting out this
unseasonably warm Canadian Prairie winter.  But I think we'll roll out the
280SL this evening, put the top down, and stuff the kids in the jumpseat -
just to say that we drove topless on a Canadian Christmas Eve.

Merry Christmas to All,
Dave Jorgensen

PS:  "10 Best" in January's "Car and Driver" has a real fine picture of a
cheesehead...
