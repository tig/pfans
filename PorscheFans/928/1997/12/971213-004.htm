Dear Mark and the rest of the "Land Shark" tamers:

Several years ago, there was an article in Excellence (Oct.92 ?) on the
subject. The author, (sorry, but I do not have the article or the name)
trailered a small travel trailer with his 82 or 83 928. Ther trailer was
less than 5K lbs. but much more than 1K lbs. Seems the 928 had no problem
towing that trailer.

I occasionally tow a small utility trailer that weighs less than 1K lbs. No
special hitch is required and no extra holes were drilled into the OEM
bumper either. It was on my car at the "Frenzy".

On a different note, I still have some "928 Frenzy" polo shirts in stock.
The main color is  "ash" with black collar and cuffs. The button down slit
is teal as is the 928S on the left breast with the left side of the car in
profile. The words "928 Frenzy" are above the car. An oval with "shark
teeth" at the top and bottom borders the entire logo. In all, the logo is
3.5" in length and about 2.5" in height. The quality of the shirt is
compareable to "Outer Banks". $35 for Medium or Large, $37 for eXtra-Large
or eXtra-eXtra-large, including delivery. 

Send a check made out to "PCA Potomac", to:

Happy motoring and holidays. Ed

Hi Gang!

I am going to check out a 79 928 next thursday at a salvage sale.  It is
supposed to have damage to the RF and left side.  This could mean anything
from a slight dent to a wadded mass of "what is it?".  Anybody looking for
anything?  I will pick it up if it has anything going for it.

And my exciting news that is of no interest to anyone else, is that I conned
my wife into letting me keep my 79 and my 81.  I told her that the 79 could be
*her* 928.  I really need a bigger garage.........
