>Not a.

Based upon some previous posts, usage of 1 quart every few K miles is
not uncommon.  I just talked to my mechanic.  He said not to be overly
concerned with that range of usage - provided it wasn't leakage of
course.  He said he was pretty sure that the factory spec was 1 Quart
per 800 miles.

Perhaps it's more to do with harder driving.

>I see 6k on the tach occasionally too. (Yes LL I do)

I note the defensive posture wrt to LL :)

>What is the effect of C, I don't understand?

stabilizer?  I don't know either.  It's the last free variable in the
equation so it's suspect. I'm going to pull out the bottle and look
again at the contents tonight and double check. Some fuel additives
are based upon methyl alcohol which is not a good thing for your
engine.  I assume STA-BIL is not, since it was recommended by the list
and my mechanic.

All-in-all, I think that this has been a newbie false alarm.  I've
never owned a car that _wasn't_ leaking that went through that much
oil.  The 16V Scirocco uses _zero_ oil between changes (3K) and I _do_
drive that one with the pedal to the floor almost all the time.


Thanks for all the help though.

P.S.

BTW, SO mis-placed the catalog of car models (@!#&).  I'll have to do
a thorough search tonight.
