The CSi is about 20-35k more than a GTS, big bucks by anyones measure.

Not exactly approach, a Dinan equipped 850 surpasses a 928s performance,
and will put up a good fight with a Devek equipped car, and still be civil
in doing it

.. I don't mean to put down 928s, but the 94' on V8's and 95' on V-12's are
very good cars. I drive 928s, part them out, tune them, pretty much eat
breathe and sleep 928. But the 8 series is a beautiful car with a bomb
proof build quality and handling that seems to defy the fact that is
weights almost 700 lbs more than a GTS.

I feel much safer and comfortable doing 150 in the BMW than the 928. The
power delivery is silky smooth, and the interior is much better put
together than the Porsche's.


>...and needs modifications to approach the handling and adhesion of a stock
>928...

Not really modifications, I'm just returning it to European CSI specs
forshock valving, springs, and swaybar. Porsche targets the sports car
market (even with the "GT" 928), BMW doesn't, at least not with the 8
series. The us models especially have been softened up and I'm just
bringing it to use the cars suspension geometry to the maximum.



Anyway, let's end this thread, I love 928s, and I love the BMW 8's, that's
why I have one of each.
