We've got some really nice weather out here in New England (sorry to
you all on the West Coast) so I uncovered the Shark and took her for a
spin this morning.  I've got a couple of questions for the group:

The first thing I did was check all the fluids and I noticed that it
was about 1/2 of a quart low on oil.  I think mine seems to be using a
quart every 1K to 2K miles; I haven't driven it enough yet to get good
metrics. After following the thread on GTS oil consumption I was
wondering if any GT drivers/owners out there have any metrics on 89-91
Shark's oil usage?  BTW, it's got 29K on the odo, I'm using
non-synthetic oil, and I'm pretty sure at the moment that it's usage
and not leakage.

Also, the steering wheel is squeaking when I turn it.  I've never
owned a car that had a squeaky steering wheel, but I've only owned a
928 for a few months. Is this normal?  Or an indication of an existing
problem or an indication of one about to occur?  Any pearls of squeaky
steering wheel wisdom?


Thanks in advance.


BTW, the SO wants an Esprit, so I've been eavesdropping in on the
lotus mailing list. Anybody been over there?  IMHO, it isn't as fun as
this one...
