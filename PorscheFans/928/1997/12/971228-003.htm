This is late as it's my first chance to review what's been going on in
here since Xmas day.   Just thought you might be interested in what's
going on with the whole air bag/air bag switch fiasco.

My job interfaces me with Delphi (formerly Delco Electronics) where the
GM air bags are developed and produced.  Just two weeks ago, an engineer
required some help in solving a motion problem - he works in one of
their advanced engineering departments.  We discussed  technical aspects
and reviewed results to date, and he escorted me to their lab to see
some working designs.   They are developing an ultrasonic scanner to be
located around the sun visor area that will sweep the seat - building an
occupant profile.   Is anyone there?    Approximately how large?   This
info will be processed and the output of the airbag adjusted.   Smart
airbags.

There was no particular concern about propriety, and I'm certain most
manufacturers are working on the same problem.   We're probably a couple
of years away from first production units (at least for GM).

Have a good one, folks!

Anthony,

I had the same problem with my '90.
 
What I did was removed the tool kit panel. This exposed the hatch release
motor assembly and more importantly, exposed the motor assembly attachment
screws. These are the two hex head screws that attach the assembly to a
bracket. If you look closely the through holes taht these screws use in the
bracket are actually slots. These slots are up and down.

I loosened these two screws (and a pan head phillips which is attached to the
motor assembly with a tinnerman (sheet metal) type nut.  I forget which
direction I moved the assembly but I think it was down. I tightened the screws
and it's worked ever since.

I don't know if this is the official adjustment procedure, but when I saw
those slots, I figured they must be there for something.

Anyone have any other methods?

Hope this helps

Thats the same way I did it with my 89 GT. I moved it down because if it is
moved to much further up the hatch may not close properly.

Hi 

  I have an earily 928 (78) and the fan was not wired to operate without the
key in.  The car about cooked its self until I did two things.  The hood was
hot enough after two hours to grill on.  I was vary concerned about the paint
on the hood and the well being of the electrics.  For example the oil pressure
sensor would show no oil pressure until the car cooled off.

  As I send two changes have solve my problems.
  1) The radiator has a high temperature switch in the lower front (I don't
remember which side).  The swtch goes to the radiator fan and is controled by
a relay.  This relay doesn't get power if the ignition is off so the make the
relay activity I had power applied from the live side of the battery.  The
circuit board is under the passinger floor board was jumpered to make the
relay active.  So the fan comes on anytime the car is TOOOO hot.
  2) I applied some after market heat shielding to the under side of the hood.
I got it from devek or automotion - can't remember which.  The heat shield has
really cooled to hood.  I don't think that the engine is cooler but the hood
and air take seem to benefit.

  Regards
  Walt Chapman
