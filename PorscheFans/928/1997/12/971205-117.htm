Hi. I posted the following message a few days ago, but with one exception,
received no reply. Nor did I read my post in the forum over the past three
days, so I'll try again.

I drive a gorgeous 1990 928S4. I love everything about this car, with one
exception. I am personally bothered by the aesthetics of the car's featured
Design 90 alloy wheels. Apparently, the previous owner picked Design 90s
because they are wider than standard. 

These Design 90s are polished chrome in perfect condition, and feature the
usual tire pressure sensors. Would be willing to make a trade.

The wheel design I really like most are called *phone dials*. I've admired
them on 944s, but haven't seen them on 928s after 1989. (Frankly, I don't
even see that many 928s in the Seattle area). But I don't know whether or
not phone dials are wide enough to to fit my front tires 225/50 ZR 16, and
rear 245/45 ZR 6. 

Does anyone know whether or not phone dial wheels can be substituted for
Design 90s in 1990 models?. If so, where does one get them?  Thanks for your
consideration.
