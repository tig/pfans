In the Dec 11, 1997 928 list, you offered:

>> I used to have a blower in my 928.  I'll let you have her real cheap.  It
>> will save me the alimony payments.


Send her by.  Most parts are expected to perform to original specification.
Used spares live in the garage except when they are pressed into service, by
the way.  Have to presume that the seals are intact and that she can handle
the high-RPM service without throwing a rod.  Good bottom-end lubrication is
a must for this service...


This can get way out of hand in a short while!

To whoever it was that posted that their oil drain plug had stripped out and
were going to just remove the filter (or put a hole in it) and let the engine
run until all the oil spews out.

Man.....I have got to laugh at that one.....in fact......invite me over for
your next oil change, cause I want to see your face when you try this.

In all seriousness....that approach is a good idea.....BUT.....I don't think
that you want to put your internal components through the wear and tear.
Think about it for one second.  Not only is the only coming out, but there is
no lubrication being forced throughout the engine.  Engine oil is like the
blood in your body.  Without it your insides would stop working.  Let me cut
your foot off to drain you.  A bit graphic, I know, but I think you get the
picture. The connecting rod bearings, cam bearings, cylinder liner
walls/rings, lifters, and rocker arms need that oil to prevent metal to metal
contact/damage.  The oil which comes out of the pan also drains fast enough to
carry any contamination (like metal flakes, dirt, silicon, bearing material)
through the drain hole and into the pan (which is why you always make sure
your engine has been run for a few minutes before draining the sump.)  I think
you would be better off by removing the oil pan...taking it to a machine
shop...and having them oversize the hole and threading it.  Just use a larger
drainplug.  Or instead of a drainplug, have them install a drainspout.  I
believe I saw one in the brand new Performance magazine for about 20-25 bucks.
If you don't know which machine shop to go to in town, just call any big
car/truck/tractor dealer and find out who they use (if they don't have their
own).  

If you still think that the drain-the-oil-through-the-filter is your best bet,
I would be most appreciative for an invite to see this......I will bring the
bags of dry sweep/oil absorb!

Happy Motoring PO's,

Marc, (I think that is the person whom everyone is referring to about this) 

I found the article on the 928 towing setup you were asking about.
It is the October 1992 issue of Excellence, and is on pages 72-74.

The fellas name is George Caswell, and lives in Vermont. If you need his
number, I have it here at the house.  He has rebuilt several 928's and has
what he calls a love affair.  

Hopefully this will help you find out how he did the trailer/light setup.
Email me for the number.
