	Steve Peterson, wrote about a problem with the clutch hydraulics.



	There seems to be a little confusion, the clutch shares the brake 
reservoir but the hose going to the clutch is on the side of the 
reservoir, it will not completly drain the reservoir.  So no need to 
bleed the brakes, least not right now, the fluid should be changed once 
in a while.



	Bleeding the clutch, I didn't know it couldn't be done...   Fill the 
reservoir, open the bleed plug, let fluid just run down.  Then connect a 
hose and put it in a jar, now almost close the drain plug.  Get in and 
start pumping, if possible have somebody watch for bubles.  Keep 
refilling the reservoir.   Keep pumping to flush lots of new fluid, then 
tighten the plug without taking off that hose and don't let the end come 
out of the jar!  Now with the hose off check tightness of plug and check 
for leaks.

	While pumping push pedel down slowly, don't want to actually disengage 
the clutch.   You want the plug open just a little, that makes it work 
better!   If you open the plug to much it can suck air....
