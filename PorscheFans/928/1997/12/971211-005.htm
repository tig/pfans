Guess that qualifies me but it may be hard to keep up with you guys...you
all may be too far gone! :-)

This one had me gut in spasms and me eyes a-tearin'!!

<How about the Olive Green with a Red interior?  Maybe Talbot Yellow with a
Green interior would give you jalopeno cheese?  Of course, if you leave
your
cheese out long enough, you'll get a pungent combination of Oak Green
Metallic
and Light Blue Metallic.

Fondue, can you?>

<<Hire a lawyer?  I doubt that it would do any good in an automobile phisical

damage loss, unless there was some question of whether or not the damage was

deliberately caused.  Insurance policies are legal contracts.  They

stipulate what will be done under what circumstances and who will be

responsible for what actions after the loss.  And Actual Cash Value is what

any insurance company will be on the hook for, period.>>

I know this is late, but I'm still trying to catch up from the holidays.  And
after all, it's only my .02 cents worth, so freshness doesn't count.

The only thing on which I disagree with you.  An attorney can be very helpful.
You said it yourself: legal contract.  Don't be naive or romantic about
settling things on your own.  You could also screw things up (completely) on
your own.  You can't possibly think that the insurance company pulls out a
flow chart based on the "legal contract" and makes it's decisions in a
dispassionate manner with your best interests carefully balanced with their
best interests?

It took me three months to settle my last claim.  If I didn't have the means
to wait I would have settled for about 4k less.  As it is, I was paid in
November of last year $16,500 for a 1985 928S with 53K on the clock.  I
believe it was a hair more than the car was worth at that time, but not
outlandishly more.  And besides, it took 3 months to settle it  so they should
be paying a little more than if they had made a reasonable offer before hand. 

Oh, by the way, I didn't get the final $2000 until an attorney stepped in to
help.  
I also had to perform extensive research on the value of the car independant
of the "books" which don't EVER give a perfect value, unless by accident.  Use
the market to determine what comparable cars are selling for.  I still have
the spreadsheets that I made to compare my comps with the comps the insurance
company provided me to justify one of their offers.  Mine were far closer to
the description of my car, in terms of mileage, color, options, and condition.
My price was almost dead on what I had demanded.  Thier cars were the wrong
color, higher mileage, and different options.  No wonder they thought the car
was worth less.  

Incidentally the owner of the trucking company that ran over me got involved.
He was the local president of a PCA chapter.  Thought he new porsches, and
wasn't going to pay what I wanted.  What a pain in the ASS.  He was the one
who compiled the comps for the insurance company:  indiscriminately selecting
any '85 with less than 100k (some with more if you can believe it), and then
averaging the values.  What a Jackass.  

Do your homework, and call an attorney if you need one.  Even to get an extra
$500 on a settlement is worth a few hours work.  Several thousand dollars is
worth far more.
