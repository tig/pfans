    Having hit a bank nose first last week, I'd say bloody safe.  Part
of the 928's design brief was to meet all actual and conceivable safety
regulations.  It has an outstanding crumple zone, a very strong unitary
chassis, massive roll-over protection (check those B-pillars), side
intrusion beams, seat belts that fit, a longitudinally-oriented
front-mounted engine, and it's heavy.
    Being heavy is really good.  This is because you don't suffer the
same sudden deceleration as the lighter object that you hit.  Imagine a
truck and a compact.  Or a truck and a 928.  Or a train and just about
anything.
    In some circumstances the air bags can be a hindrance rather than a
help.  My smash would have been one example.  After being punched in the
face by an air bag, I would have had a tougher time shutting down the
engine, and then rolling the car to a safe resting place, out of the way
of other traffic.  I had absolutely no bruising from the seatbelt, and
wonder what would have happened if I did have an air bag.
    Most head-on collisions are not truly head on, but somewhat
off-angle, and certainly off-centre.  In these circumstances you won't
come to a rest immediately, and being able to see, and possibly steer,
could be advantageous.
    I realize there are no statistics in this post, and look forward to
other people's comments on this thread.

One aribag (or blower) is more than enough, especially without a stereo.
