Howdy Math, 
I know exactly how you feel, we have 9 cameras between Amsterdam and
Alkmaar a distance of about 30-40 km and they say three are active at
any one time so no hope of letting the beast loose on the way home.
Thanks for the kind comments although you better check the address you
sent them to. He He He. ( the old "reply" button I guess)??
I guess you're right about the benefits of a forum like this in
developing a good knowledge base especially if you are on the look out
for a good 928 (I'll be open to offers on mine in about 6 months or so
by the way its an '87 so its even cheaper!!!).
I just might go one step up to GT when I move as I may have some "Tax
Free" rights, something I must look into.

A question for anybody who has done business with 928 International:
Do these guys really have a catalog or do they just put it in their ads.
I've Called and E-mailed three or four times with no result.
