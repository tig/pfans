Hehehe - you guys make me feel so NORMAL!!!  When I got mine home
(after a 4 hour drive in the rain from down country on a Sunday night) and
parked it in the garage next to the Lotus I couldn't quite believe it was
really there.  It was like one of those dreams where you've got all the cars
you ever wanted.  I turned out the light that night to go to sleep and very
shortly I sat up again.  "What's wrong?" asked Vivienne as I jumped out
of bed, then she laughed "One more look, huh?" 

It was still there.  And again the next morning when I looked before I jumped
in the shower.  At least my garage is just down a couple of stairs from the
lounge, so I didn't lose too much touch with... ummm... what was her name
again?
