as far as 928's in movies, a few near misses come to mind:

a 'mini set' on display for viewing by people in the waiting room 
queue
for the attraction based on the 1974 movie earthquake features a tiny
street scene replica of a disaster street & includes a 928 which is 
pretty funny since the movie was made several years before the 928 was 
avail.  obviously somebody who constructed the set for the universal 
studios ride didn't do their research/continuity homework!

another near miss was the cool 928 scenes in the original batman
BOOK sized comic about the aging dark prince that was published a
few yrs prior to the movie.  bruce wayne owned a 928 but they didn't
put it in the movie for some reason, maybe not to steal any limelite 
from their hyped up techno-big-budget battycar?
