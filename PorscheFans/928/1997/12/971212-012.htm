Reminds me of an engine that we saw at this year's NER 928 Tech
Session. A cooling system hose had ruptured; the "Coolant" warning
light came on, but the owner ignored it. Engine got hot (don't
know if the temp gauge indicated it, as it may depend on the
presence of coolant). Because of heat and differential expansion,
a joint opened up and all the oil was quickly pumped out. All
this apparently happened in a very few minutes, with the end
result being a ruined main bearing journal in the crankshaft.
Fortunately the cylinder walls still looked like new.

Now, some of us have had cooling systems that leak a bit, and
have seen the coolant warning come on when the car is started
from cold when it gets down a pint or so. So you may be tempted
to drive a few miles more, to a more convenient stopping place,
if the light comes on while you're underway. The message at
the Tech Session was "Don't do it! Stop and check right now,
or you and your bank account may be very sorry." 

At least it gave us a nice engine to explore at the Tech Session,
but I doubt that that's much solace to the owner.
