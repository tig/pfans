I am doing an article on the 928 (I own an '86), and would like to obtain some hard numbers on the 
expenses of operating one, beyond what I already know or have experienced.  If anyone would care 
to do so, I'd like to know your typical total costs (the bottom line) at a dealer or independent 
shop for a routine 30,000, 60,000, or 90,000 mile servicing for a stock 928 regardless of which 
model you own. Or, maybe the average costs for having a dealer or independent shop perform typical 
maintenance and repair needed for a vehicle driven, say, 10,000 miles a year.   You can respond 
here or to me directly at: ejporter@ix.netcom.com      I will post the averages here for all to 
see; the point here is to gather some general information, besides the often quoted statement that 
928's "can be expensive."  We kinda already are aware of that!  Thank you for any information you 
care to provide.
