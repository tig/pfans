Have you read Ed's more recent post (earlier today) on this subject?
Successful plating is not just a matter of deposition, which is what you've
described; you've also got to convince the new material to stick, and stay
stuck, to the base. This is much easier with iron or steel than with
aluminum, because aluminum oxide is a hard, inert mineral which coats any
aluminum part left in air for any length of time. Bare aluminum is highly
chemically reactive, as you can discover by scratching up your wheels and
letting road salt get to them.

The etching Ed talks about is a chemical process to remove the oxide, which
process of necessity must eat at least a little into the underlying
aluminum. This isn't just a question of losing a small percentage of the
total weight of metal in the wheel. The "skin" (thin outside layer) is
disproportionately important to the wheel's strength, particularly in a
forged wheel, and you don't want to rupture or remove it. Strong etching
will also attack any little crack, void, or other inhomogeneity in the
wheel, typically making said flaw bigger.

Ed also talks about heat treatment, which wouldn't surprise me, in that a
plated layer may need to be annealed to relieve stresses so that it doesn't
later pull itself off the base (again more of a problem with aluminum,
which expands and contracts with temperature a lot more than steel or
chromium, and with wheels generally, which get a lot hotter, courtesy of
your brakes and wheel bearings, than bumpers or door handles). Heat
treatment might also encourage a bit more chemical reaction between the
chrome and the aluminum to get more of a bond. However, it will tend to
draw the temper on the wheel's metal, thus weakening the wheel.

Sorry, chrome lovers, I support Ed in discouraging you from doing this to
your aluminum wheels. If you need shine, polish them, clear coat them, wax
them, and leave it at that.
