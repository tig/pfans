I will not touch the ethanol subject.  It probably isn't as good as
regular gas for your car but its cleaner to the environment (this point
could also be debated...)

For the water, you can just go buy distilled water to fill up the
radiator blended with the appropriate antifreeze.  Even if you decide
to use your hard water, I would assume that the antifreeze manufacturer
would be adding some chemical to take care of them.  But this is just 
an informed assumption ;-)

Hope you get your shark soon,
