talking through my hat-- it's happened maybe twice before...

Does anyone else have any info on the stock
security system? I run into this problem a lot as
well. If I open *any* door other than the driver's
side first, the car won't start. I have to do a
musical chair type thing with the door locks and
the ignition key for 15 minutes or so, until I get
the combination right. Is there a way to get
around this security "feature"?

There is a SPDT switch mounted at the end of the door lock.  Depending on the year, some of the internal contacts are silver-plated rather 
than gold-plated.  If silver-plated, there will be tarnish.  It's just a matter of cleaning it with some chemical contact cleaner (local 
Radio Shack..) and everything should be fine.
