Forget models and movies.  Whilst in our nationwide junk shop (the
Warehouse) I spied a computer game called GT Racing.  And what was
featured on the cover  -- none other than our good ol' shark.  All for
$NZ9.95.  On the rear was a late model 911, and what I took to be a
Ferrari (it was red, and appeared mid-engined).  I didn't buy, because
they have a half price sale on Boxing Day (December 26th) so I'll grab a
copy then, along with all the other things I really need.  Does anyone
know if there is actually a 928 in the game?  It loooked a bit shonky,
so perhaps the cover is the only redeeming feature.  PA.  Feeling
flush?  Splash out before the 26th?

I wonder if the courses feature any banks?

Subject: oil consuption etc.



 Itried to post the following message to this list last week, but it never

appeared there.

Meanwhile, I have learned from John White that the oil consumption topic was

already discussed. Anybody remember roughly when this was, so that I can check

the archive?

Hi everybody!

two and >now feel compelled to post this mail. Basically, there are three

things I'd like to >address:

though.

live) to >Munich in a hurry (210 miles in 1:50 h), in moderate traffic, which

involved lots of >kick-down (some people think they should bumble along at 100

The original date of posting was Dec 17th , there were follow up postings on
Dec 18th and many more on Dec 19th.  (Sorry about the cut'n'paste it was a
little sloppy!) 

I would also like to add what I can to the "flaming chrome wheels" post...
	Having worked in the zinc plating industry for several years I, and receiving
several phone calls from customers looking for a chrome platter I have a
limited perspective on this subject. Having worked only with iron or steel
products. How it corresponds with alloy wheels, is up to the metallurgist
mentioned below.

Subject: Flames on Chrome Wheels



<<There has been at least



one incident where a wheel split under hard cornering and braking.



Fortunately, only slight body damage was the outcome.







For street driving, chromed wheels will probably be ok. If you plan to do



PCA Driver's Ed events, but must have shiny wheels, polish them.?>>



Ed-  



You knew I would be one to disagree.  Considering we have already had this

conversation with regard to polishing.  



There is NO evidence that the wheel you mention above split because of

chroming.  So it isn't relevant.



Chromed wheels for street driving will "probably" be ok?  They are most

definitely ok on tens of thousands of cars each and evey day.  



Where is the metallurgist that answered my questions about polishing several

months ago.  



Sorry Ed.  I don't have chrome wheels, but I am argumentative AND curious.  So

this is purely and academic excercise for me.  If anyone can explain why or

why not wheels should not be chromed, please do.  I am interested in knowing

if the heat range of the chroming process can actually weaken the temper of

the wheel.  

	In my experience the surface of the object that had to be chromed would first
be submerged in a caustic cleaning solution. Followed by a nice bath in an
acid solution( I believe the local's use sulfuric acid), then the process of
adding a nickel base and polishing to a shine, followed by copper, then nickel
and finally chrome, to achieve a layered effect.  This is the process I am
familiar with.  If this were the same used for alloy wheels.  The wheel
designated for chroming would almost certainly need to be made of a denser or
somewhat different mix of alloy to withstand the chroming process.  Of course,
being that I am a new member to this list, I have missed the first post on
this subject.  So It could be quite possible that there is a different method
to chrome alloy wheels.  But, in the way I described, It would be the acid
weakening the alloy to cause the cracking of the wheel under high load stress.
I guess this does not answer your question about heat affecting temper.  But
it is my understanding that depending on the heat intensity and duration of
heating does affect the temper of metals., We regularly sent finished products
off to be "heat treated" after we plated them,  i.e, our process affected the
temper of grade eight fasteners, and they had to be heat treated after our
process.
	Now of course I could be comparing apples to oranges, so I am prepared for
the inevitable flame.  But, as they say, that's my 928 cents worth.

~~Happy Holidays

	Hoping I don't get too flamed about my previous post, I will open myself up
to the inevitable jibe about ethanol.  Alas, I am not a 928 owner yet, but
plan to go shark fishing this spring when the weather turns more favorable in
this region. But for now, If you don't mind. Does anyone have any input about
ethanol?  I do not use it in my current rides, nor would I in any future
shark, but seeing how there is a plentitude of ethanol blends around here, I
am afraid of any harmful side effects if may have in a future 928. Any input
would be appreciated.  Also, this is a "hard water town", dare I think of what
that would do to the circulatory system of a land shark..?

Sooo.... it wasn't oil but a vapor trail upon re-entry into earth's
atmosphere.
Thanks for clearing that matter up, Gene.

Merry Xmas to all 928 astronauts

It is the drawing that is in Anson's 1998 catolog.  The catolog says it's a
GTS and the drawing is of an S4.  Don't think anyone is really sure exactly
what it will really be.
