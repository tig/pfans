Your post asked about replacing the front crank seal without
disassembling most of the engine.   I haven't seen a specific procedure
in the manual - but I did rebuild my engine several months ago.  It
appears to me the seal indeed can be readily removed and replaced with
the engine intact.   There is no special 'lip' or other doo-dad on the
seal hidden from view to make removal that difficult.   I'd probably
poke a small screwdriver through the outer face of the seal to try to
get enough wiggle behind it and slide it forward.   Another possible way
would be to twist two small self-tapping screws at 3 o'clock and 9
o'clock and gently pull forward.

The book and several after market vendors are specific in their
suggestion to use nothing on the replacement seal outer surface
(sealants, lubricants, etc.).   You likely don't have a deep-socket seal
driver for seating the new seal, but you should be able to use an
appropriately sized PVC pipe, carefully sawed square at one end, and use
this as your driver (for additional protection, you can run a strip of
duct tape around the edge of the pipe to further protect the seal
surface).   It should not take a whole lot of force to get the seal
seated - it's a straight shot around the crank and into the recess in
the block.

Disclaimer - I have not actually done this!   I definitely studied this
very issue while assembling  the engine so I could rectify any oil leaks
in the future.

Hope this helps!   Good luck and let us all know your results!
