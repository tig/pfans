Hi all:

The only thing worse for me than hearing all these stories of 'must
sell' is 'just crashed' !  Well it all goes around maybe all the just
crashed can buy the must sells and the crashed go to restorers or
recyclers.  I keep telling everyone there are less and less everyday,
imagine the 928 market in just a few years - just try to find a 5-speed
any year for what we're seeing them now.    

Andy I suspect the insurance company might try to write this one off. 
The body work and paint matching alone is enough to send claims
adjusters into the shivers.  Well, have a thorough inspection done maybe
it isn't that bad as the shop says.  As long as body measurements are
repairable within factory spec's and ditto wheel alignment settings.   
There is always the option of adding the Devek rollbar / cage +
harnesses :) though I am undecided whether I will run mine full time on
the street or not.  Imagine getting pulled over for speeding and trying
to get away with it while the officer is checking out your car!

Hmmm,
Phil Tong
