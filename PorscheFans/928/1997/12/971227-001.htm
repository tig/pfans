Dear Darrell and the rest of the Land Shark tamers:

Although my car did not suffer from the hard start syndrome, it did have a
poor idle and low speed hesitations. It turned out to be the Mass Flow
Sensor. As soon as it was replaced the CO increased into the normal range.
Prior to the replacement the CO was barely above background level. It was as
if the engine was cleaning the atmosphere. Now it runs much smoother and has
a bit more low end PUNCH.

I have heard of at least two other cases of this malfunction. Now that the
early cars with mass flow sensors are over 10 years old, it is likely that
more will fail.

My car has recently started to have a very slight miss at idle. I suspect
that the plugs need to be replaced. Anyone try something really good? I use
NGK Platinums and they are good. I had used Bosch Platinums, but was not
impressed. I've also tried the Splitfires and was impressed until they
loosened from their seats. I had torqued them all properly, but they still
came loose. I think I will try the Silverstone Plugs. You know, the ones
with the silver tips. Hey if you see a Prussian Blue 928S with the driver
yelling "High-ol-Silver Away!!!", he is probably refering to the plugs.

Happy motoring and New Year. Ed
