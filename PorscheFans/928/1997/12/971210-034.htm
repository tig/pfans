Hey, I guess I'll dive into this discussion, as when I owned a Mustang, I
was VERY close to buying one for it.

I would think that the best supercharger (centrifugal wise), would be the
Powerdyne unit that uses a kevlar drive belt and has no oil within it.  The
Vortech requires plumbing the motor oil lines up to it, and the Paxton
requires oil that also must be changed, but is contained only within the
unit.  The Powerdyne unit was selected by Ford SVO to be the kit that they
wanted to offer, and the prices on them are cheaper, as they are slightly
simpler in design and execution.  They also claim lower temps as they don't
have oil in them that gets warm.

Even though they don't make the heat of a turbo, the supercharger will
still increase air temps pretty good.  An intercooler would be a nice way
to help prevent detonation and allow you to use more boost for more power.
Procharger offers their kits with one on all 9psi+ kits, but they are more
expensive since they come with it.

Another thought might be an electric supercharger.  One is being prepared
now to offer a 6 psi unit for about $2k for 3.0 and larger motors and it
can truly offer the instant boost.  A centrifugal unit does not produce a
lot of boost off the line and does require spooling up to get a noticable
difference.  This is why the Roots guys like to claim they are better, as
their blowers do generate more off the line.

For setup, I would say that a centrifugal blower (and an electric would be
even better) would be the way to go for setup on a 928.  The Roots blower
would require a totally new air intake setup on the car.  IMHO it would be
much easier to air-plumb a centrifugal unit into the air intake on the 928
over a Roots.  If you're looking for top speed out of your car, then the
centrifugal is probably the way to go as they can help generate the higher
boost at higher rpm where needed.

Actually, in the Camaro/Mustang type group, the centrifugal units are now
getting more popular and plentiful over the Roots units, which were often
used on carbed cars and can be seen sticking out of the hoods of drag cars everywhere.
