Red Line's chemist agrees:  if the engine is air-cooled, or if the
engine is older and has greater bearing and ring clearances, the 15W50
and 20W50 will develop a thicker oil film.

>>Some racing engines hve the tolerances opened up and then use a 50 w
oil, this is done to reduce friction, a motor set up like this won't
last long.

I guess you might reduce friction by loosing clearances, but you're
going to rob hp by going to a thicker oil....each reduction in viscosity
grade will allow 1-2% more power.


VISCOSITY NOTES:

The viscosity seen in a bearing or cam may be completely different than
the labeled viscosity. Petroleum oils lose considerable viscosity at
high RPMs and high temperatures. In contrast, Red Line synthetics are
much more resistant to viscosity loss than even the best petroleums. A
petroleum 20W50 begins as a 20W oil and the oil is thickened with a
polymeric plastic substance which will thicken the oil at higher
temperatures. Unfortunately, when the oil enters a high shear stress
area such as a bearing, these large polymer molecules align themselves
in order to create the path of least resistance. As shown in Figure 1,
the apparent viscosity can be much less than the viscosity listed on the
container - typical 20W50s will actually be similar to an SAE 30 or 40
in the bearing. The same behavior occurs with all multigrades, with a
petroleum 5W30 shearing down to a 10W or 20W and a synthetic 5W50
shearing similarly to a petroleum 20W50. No wonder 5W30s are not
recommended for sustained high-speed driving.
