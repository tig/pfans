You're welcome. However, let me (strongly) suggest that you not copy the
entirety of the message to which you're responding. Among other things, it
makes it hard for the reader to find your response.
 
>Would you ever consider putting a supercharger on your car?

I am considering it as we speak, because no other modification gives as
much bang for the buck. However, as I told you last time, normally
aspirated engines tend to respond more snappily, in a way which suits most
people who go for big engines in the first place. This leaves me sitting on
the fence.

There's nothing in a nice shrink-wrapped box, but there are both
turbocharged and belt-driven supercharged 928s out there. One person on the
928 list who has direct experience with both is Marc Reviel
(mreviel@jump.net).
