Why? If you don't see the badge, do you forget you have a Porsche? :^)

I prefer to go "stealth mode". Having the only 928 in a 70km radius does
have its drawbacks. Having a nice bland colour (rubinrotmetallic) helps.

I know it's a Porsche (actually, I don't really care for Porschea in
general, but I love 928's. I'd have a 928 if it was built by Yugo.

I'm still trying to figure out the best way to remove the "Porsche 928S"
that it etched into the rear end of my car. Flexible body filler?

With a suitably hard-to-remember licence tag, and no identification
markings at all, Joe Average is going to have a hard time complaining.

Mr Police Officer: "So you say he passed you doing 130MPH. What sort of car
was it?

Mr Joe Average: "Duh - I'm not sure. It was crimson. Could have be a Toyota
Supra, I guess."

Mr Police Officer: "What was it's licence?"

Mr. Joe Average: "Ummm. OO1010, I think!"

Mr Police Officer traces the licence tag to a Trabant and gives up there
and then.


* God, I hope I got my apostrophes and Porsche pluralizationism right! *
