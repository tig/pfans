Help!

First of all, I got booted from the list apparently and had to re-join.
Secondly, and most important, my 84S got a slight reprieve from winter on
Saturday to go to the car wash. After backing it out of the garage(it had
been sitting for at least two weeks), I noticed a very large pool of green
fluid (anti-freeze) on the garage floor. Here is what I know: When I had my
car up on a lift doing some service this summer I had it running for about
10 minutes while I checked and added ATF.I noticed at one point that an
apparent coolant overflow had triggered and dumped fluid. It stopped and was
fine after getting back in the car and driving. Fact #2: Over these past 2-3
weeks I have started my 928 to keep it's blood flowing so to speak and let
it run for 5-10 minutes each time but did not drive it. After finding the
pool of coolant on Saturday I did continue on to the car wash and drove it
"calmly" for about 15 minutes watching the temp. gauge closely. When I
arrived back home I parked in a different spot and have not seen any coolant
since Sat. (2.5 days). If someone has experienced this or knows something
about it please let me know. I can't stand the site of shark blood.

Thanks,
