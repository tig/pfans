Best way would be to replace with new dash in original color.  Very
expensive. $Thousands.

If you have a leather-covered dash, it will need to be removed and
recovered with either leather or vinyl.  The major cost to this job is
the labor involved in R&R the dash correctly without messing up any of
the more delicate parts of the interior trim or electric instruments or
accessories.  I would not allow just any old trim shop to do this work
(I did my own R&R).  You could do it yourself with advice from the
repair manual, advice form those who have done it, and lots of care and
patience.  It's not hard or dirty work, just tedious and
time-consuming.  If you elect to have it done, I suggest only allowing a
mechanic who has done it before many times to do the R&R.  Book time is
around 11 hours.  Recover $250-350 vinyl, maybe twice that for leather
(+R&R labor).

An original vinyl padded dash crack is treated just like any other 1987
car.  There are people who can patch the cracks (if only one or two).
They use a putty or melt solid vinyl or similar into the crack trying to
match the color and texture of the surrounding material.  Emphasis is on
trying - it is very unlikely that an invisible repair can be made - or
that a new crack will not appear in the same or a nearby place.  For
example, the instrument cluster cover (pod cover) has a tendency to
crack front to back right in the middle.  Check with the service manager
of several  new car dealers for expensive makes - Mercedes, Lexus, BMW
etc. for a recommended repair person.  Or a really good detail shop or
high end used car dealer may know of someone.  After you ask around, in
your area, the same name will be recommended by several people.  This is
your guy.  Cost maybe $75+ depending.

There is a firm in Los Angeles, "Just Dashes" whose specialty is
recovering padded vinyl dashes.  You send them your dash, they grind,
fill, repad with high-density foam, then recover with vinyl,
vacuum-formed to fit (with heat).  They have several textures available,
will recolor to match a sample and guarantee the result.  I have visited
their shop, seen work both in-process and completed and can recommend
the process.  Cost $500-600 or so. This firm rebuilds many '50s cars and
handles very complex dashes - just look at a 1959 Caddy dash
someday....   I have seen one black dash from a 1986 that would be a
good candidate for this shop.  It had been in the sun so long that the
center and edges were curled up with underlying plastic deformed.  Even
so, I would probably look for a good used dash.

Another option is the so-called 'dash cap'.  Coverlay is molded styrene
that is glued over the dash (or pod) and is sold by many mail-order
houses.  This can be a pain to install and always looks just like what
it is - a chintzy repair. $100.

Carpeted cover.  "Dash-mat" $50-75.  Looks like what it is.  I actually
prefer this to Coverlay.  Eisier to install, can be taken off to wash or
replace and not very damaging to to original dash.  Most just have a few
glue-on velcro strips.

I suggest R&R yourself, have good trim shop recover in matching vinyl.
I paid $250 a year ago to recover dash and glove box cover in vinyl
which almost (but not quite) matches the leather.  Or, Dash-mat until
you have saved up enough money and courage to R&R and recover.

You'll notice that I have not recommended a used dash.  That is because
I have never seen one in decent shape.  I did luck out and find a used
uncracked pod cover from a 1987 and paid $150 for it.  I have my fingers
crossed every time I drive my car - no cracks yet.....  I have also had
my old pod recovered in vinyl - takes a real trim genius to do that.
Unfortunately, I neglected to ask the trim shop to enlarge the holes for
the six switches to allow for the additional thickness of vinyl.  The
switches bind and don't operate easily.   Thus, the used pod.
