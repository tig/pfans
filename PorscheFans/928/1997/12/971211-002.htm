Hi Andy,

The car only scares the hell out of me because I'm new to the whole super
car thing. I'm still upgrading the operators software. Even though I don't
have the fastest or the stiffest shark out there it's still got more
potential than I can bring out as yet. And, yeah I like the adrenalin rush
from carefully pushing past my own abilities. How else am I gonna learn. I
think this summer I'll take LL's advice and try a PCNA track weekend at
Loudon, NH to learn more about how to make the car handle properly.

As far as 911's are concerned I wasn't even slightly interested in one,
ever. Why would I want a car that is that imbalanced (oh man, am I gonna
get flamed for that). That's just my opinion of course. I'm a tech-weenie
engineer type and the 928 was the only car short of a Countach that ever
appealed to me. I waited until I was a home owner and had a good garage, a
stable salary, and could pay cash before even considering making the move
toward a 928. I also waited a year to find a 5 speed as opposed to an auto.
I still have an ear to ear grin every time I open the garage door. I just
hope that feeling never goes away.

Yadda, yadda, yadda.
