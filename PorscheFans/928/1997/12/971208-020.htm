Hello all,

Hopefully someone has come across with this bug!!!

Unfortunately I left my 928S4 '89 sitting for too long,  after three
weeks of inactivity I tried to turn it on, but it failed.  I noticed
that the gas level was very low,  as well as the battery.  My first
reaction was to add more gas and recharge the battery.  The problem
remained the same acting like out of gas,  the car cranks, but it
doesn't fire up.  There is this constant-fast clicking noise and
vibration coming from the injector racks (left/right).  Thinking that
the fuel pump might be bad,  I unscrewed the fuel lines by the right
rear tire under the tank intake and in front of the engine to verify
whether the fuel was being delivered,  as expected gas is not being
pumped up.  Easy fix - bad fuel pump,  right?.  

I decided to tow the car to my local dealership to get it fixed.
Explained to them what I have done as far as troubleshooting and the
first thing they said (without checking) was that the computer is bad.
They called me the next day with an estimate of about $2,000 to get it
fix,  the dealer claims that the LH control unit is bad which has
disabled the fuel pump,  they are also saying that there is a
ground-wire problem,  and that the car is flooded.  There labor charges
are 3.5 hours???....  I questioned the dealership by requesting a full
dump/print out of the computer register states as well as the error
codes to verify their claim,  but they refused to do that.  Also
questioned the "flooded state",  flooded with what?  there is no gas
being delivered to the injectors....  I rejected their claim and ended
up paying $200 for diagnosis charges (which I'm disputing!!).

Has any one seen this before?  The car is still disabled in the garage
(3 months already) and I'm trying to understand more about this problem.
 I called different mail-order companies RE: LH control unit,  the
lowest price that I found was about $600.  Are these units easy to
install? is it the whole computer? any workarounds?


Appreciate your help....
