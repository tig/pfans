Hey:

On 12.10.97, Patrick listed the Old Car Price Guide "values" for 81-89
928s'.  The 83-84 928 was listed with a higher relative value.  Was this a
misprint?  Ignorance?  Is there any rationale for this higher number?

With the exception of a few sarcastic remarks (no offense taken), the list
members provided no explanation for the variance.  I was waiting for a
highly regarded and enlightened member to provide an "everyone knows why"
justification. Your explanation would certainly go a long way toward
helping me justify having way too much money in my 928.  Did I mention it
was a 1984?

In any case... Patrick, if I send you a self-addressed, postage paid
envelope, will you send me a copy.  I'd love to have it for my files.  Not
that it would help me sell my car for "what it's worth" to any of you
"sharks," but maybe it would help with some "trout" who is a shark wannabe.

After a few weeks as a subscriber, this is the first time I have posted.  I
want you all to know that I really enjoy your company.

Take care.

Steve
