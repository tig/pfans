  Devek's catalog mentions that the rear toe arms should be "pinned" for

  wide tire applications.  I'm not sure how that is done, but if you did

(Hi again Jim,)

Actually I believe you don't void "the design".  At Frenzy, Marc Thomas
showed me (and the rest of the CT gang) the pinning thing.  There's a
bushing that mounts the front of the rear control arms.  It's just
outboard of the pivot and is about 2" in diameter - very funky looking
design.  In any event, the "mod" is to drill through both bushing and
control arm and insert a bolt ("pin") to keep the rear toe from changing
as much as originally designed.  As others have said, the reason is that
wider tires are much more sensitive to toe and so you want less toe
change under load changes for wide rear tires.  (There's even a pilot
hole already in the bushing.)

Now the funny part - I didn't have my car at Frenzy and when I got home
I looked under mine and saw it was ALREADY pinned!  Since mine is an
early S4 (#181) with the 16x8 rears, I wonder if this was a factory mod
(but maybe later dropped by the factory).  What's the origin of the
mod?  I doubt that all S4's have this bolt in there - some of you can
check and then post pinned or not with last 4 digits of the VIN.  (It
could be a prev owner did it - but from what I know of my cars history
and from seeing so little modified on the car ( no stereo, alarm, .... -
nuthin) I really doubt it.)

Very curious,
Kurt
