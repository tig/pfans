>Sung, I know these aren't similar cars as-far-as design and purpose, =
but >what are your driving impressionsof each. . .

The Volvo 850 Turbo used to be my everyday driver until I recently =
bought the GTS.  The 928 was very fun for awhile, but I'll take the SLK =
as the most enjoyable experience for both short and long trips.  There =
is just too much worrying going on with the GTS to have any real fun.  =
Especially when it comes to electrical glitches that I can't seem to =
solve (I guess I'll have to start looking for corrosion at all ground =
connections).

As far as the C2 Turbo 3.6L... it's been refined to the point that it's =
almost as comfortable as the 928 on the freeway.  Please do not confuse =
this auto with earlier 930's as it's ride has been softened up plenty =
even compared to the 91-92 C2 Turbos 3.3L.  I still haven't mastered =
driving this beast as I still have a tendency to lay off the throttle =
on/off ramps which can be very dangerous as higher speeds.  It's a good =
thing that I only get heavy on the throttle in nice straight paths.  =
I'll find some time to goto a PCA event and really learn how to drive =
this thing in the near future.  I mainly bought it because I found it at =
a bargain price ($52K in perfect factory condition and 12K miles from a =
widow that had to leave the country the very next day).

Overall, I guess I'll pick the MBZ SLK as my favorite driver followed =
by:
	2.	Ninja (once a week thrill ride in the canyons)
	3.	C2 Turbo (trouble free PERFORMANCE!)
	4.	928 GTS (if everything ever works at the same time!)
	5. 	Volvo 850 Turbo (solid as a rock!)

Don't get me wrong here.. I love all these cars even the Volvo!  It's =
been very good to me.  I can't say the same about the 928!

I had one of my AC hoses replaced this summer. The subject of R12 replacement
came up and I believe the shop told me that the only thing that may need
changed was  the O ring seals. Apparently a certain type O ring must be used
to be compatible with R134.
