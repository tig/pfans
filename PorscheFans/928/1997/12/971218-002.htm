Anthony,

  Years ago I bought a book from one of those organizations that tells you
  how to avoid or beat the rap on tickets.  One case they cited was about
  a speeder that got nailed from a plane.  The speeder asked the officer
  on the ground how many people were in the survellence plane; the officer
  replied that there was only one.  As it turned out, the speeder happened 
  to be a pilot and he knew of an FAA regulation which prohibited a pilot 
  from doing anything but flying the plane (i.e. by FAA regs, the pilot could 
  not perform survellence AND fly the plane).  The speeder took the case to 
  court, cited the regulation, and got his ticket dropped.  You may want to 
  do a bit of homework to see if the situation applies to your case.  I can 
  look up the particulars if you're interested.
