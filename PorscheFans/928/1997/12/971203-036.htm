A 1981 928 w/AT is not a rarity.  Hold out for one with NO tranny
problems.

Lift hatch, lift carpet, see batt cover and spare tire cover.

Attachment point in engine compartment.  See owners' manual.

Maybe time for tranny rebuild.  $2,000 done right?

But, leather repairs are not cheap.

Complete Competition group includes Bilstein shocks (green in color) and
Recaro Sport seats.

Switches are marked with silk-screened symbols.  Yours have just worn
off.
New switches $35 each.

Window controls are outer switches on appropriate side. DW, SR, RW, PW.

How about documentation, repair history, contact with prior owner (PO)
check by real Porsche mechanic, not the dealer etc.  Do you have proof
that the timing belt was changed at around 100-120,000?  If not, you
will have to do that (cost $500-600).
