A few months ago I locked my keys in the hatch of my 88s4 and after a
half an hour of swearing I phoned the dealer and they told me to take a
towel and a screw driver and "gently" pry open the door and fish the
keys out, I didn't like the idea of that very much so I opened the
yellow pages and phoned a couple of locksmith's they all said "we can
open it no problem" the first one came and after trying to pick the lock
he said he needed a special tool that he didn't have. So after that I
phoned the second guy I talked to and after he tried to pick it and
failed he said "sorry I thought it would be like a 944". After hours of
frustration I took the trim off the rear quarter window and took out the
glass and grabbed my keys, the next day I went to a body shop and the
put the window back for 60.00$.  Does anyone out there have a better way
of getting in?.

Thanks,
