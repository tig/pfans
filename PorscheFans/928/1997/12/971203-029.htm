For an initial estimate, try Bruce Bowling's calculator
(http://devserve.cebaf.gov/~bowling/aero.html).

Looks like a stock-bodied S4 would need about 550 bhp at the rear wheels,
which means at least 600 at the crank.

You've raised an interesting (and fairly frequently asked) question; here's
a short answer. At a very oversimplified level:

- power goes up in proportion to displacement (e.g., going from 5 liters to
6 should result in 6/5 or 120% of power before the mod)

- power goes up in proportion to the highest engine speed at which torque
remains high (e.g., raising the gasping speed from 6000 to 7000 rpm should
result in 7000/6000 or 117% of power before the mod)

- power goes up in proportion to the air pressure going into the cylinders
(e.g., adding a supercharger which produces a boost of 0.5 bar, resulting
in 1.5 bar total pressure, should result in 1.5/1.0 or 150% of power before
the mod)

- any combination of these will increase power by the product of all the
individual factors (e.g., doing all three of the above should result in
210% of power before all three mods)

I state these not to provide an accurate estimate (there are all sorts of
interactions, plus all sorts of more minor mods, including improved intake
and exhaust flow and reprogramming of control computers) but to help you
get a rough feel for what can be attained and to permit estimating "bang
for the buck" for each approach to modification.

Remember, however, that numbers aren't everything. A nicely designed
normally aspirated (no supercharger) big V-8 gives a snappy, instantaneous
response to opening the throttle that is hard to match in a supercharged car.

>maybe we can get this car back into the spotlight.

I do like the current low profile; it helps to surprise the hot rodders.
