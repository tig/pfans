I think that you get a quick back view of the doctors 928 in Steven King's
"Thinner".  I have a feeling that there was another 928 in one of his other
movies, although I can't remember which one.  Hey who knows he may even
write a book about road killing 928's (beerfrogs included) with better
lateral supports made by  cheeseheads. I guess he could call it
Cristina..........or NightDriver.......or Needful Parts.  WARNING:Due to
sleep deprivation my humour will now self destruct. Thank you.
