I find it hard to believe a CLUB(TM) could help in such a situation. 
The 928's steering lock is quite substantial. And the 928 steering 
wheel is almost trivial to remove. I have been told a C02 cylinder for 
an air gun and a hammer is all it takes to remove a Club. Puncture the 
C02 cylinder and vent the gas on a particular place on the Club. Then a 
sharp whack with the hammer breaks the frozen steel. Or maybe that's a 
Modern Urban Myth? Makes enough sense to wonder.

Am I mistaken in assuming you had an established routine? Drive to the
train station, off to work, and back that evening? And you had a
favorite parking spot? You were a marked man. Or at least your car was.
