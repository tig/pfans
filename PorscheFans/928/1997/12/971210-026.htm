Wow!  This really makes my day!  Now, I can justify to my wife in
selling my '83 and get an '89... and still have some money left for
roses and chocolates!  :-)

Yes, you've been pretty scarce......where the heck have you been?
Good question..... The water-cooled 996 and the current 993 both use multi-
link rear suspensions which are principally of Weissach axle design. 
I'd say "pinning" the suspension as Devek recommends essentially deletes the
Weissach axle effect.
I've seen various articles about it, but the December Excellence has a blurb
regarding the 996 as compared to the 993, stating that "it's kinematics were
adjusted for even more toe-in control under various loads." 
So apparently the factory plays with the geometry (and perhaps bushings like
the 928 Weissach engineers) to get it right. Also, as we now know, apparently,
part of the equation to be figured in, is tire width.
Well, as it stands, I'm not going to extreme rubber as I was once
contemplating.
(now the question is.....what constitutes extreme?.....perhaps 315+ mm cross
section as Leonard suggests) 
Do not want to run the risk of Weissach axle over-compensation...........
otherwise known as OWS.  (Over-Weissachization-Syndrome)   :)
