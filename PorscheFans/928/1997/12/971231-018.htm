One of the best ways it to use another key.

I heard some great advice from a friend of mine & thought I would pass it
along.

Instead of using the typical magnetic spare key holder which a lot of
people look for by feeling under the bumpers or where ever, I was told to
use duct tape!  Duct tape a spare key somewhere.  Even if someone were to
"feel" for it under the car looking for a magnetic holder, they probably
would pass it by.

It might be embarrassing crawling on the ground to get your spare that way
(if you hid it real good), but it would've saved you a BUNCH of time & money.
