Hi Landsharkers,

Well after lamenting the fact that I LOVE the 928 and that ONE day I'd
have one! no-matter-what!

Good news!!  I took purchase of my 1985 (oct'84 build)
Crystal-Green-Metallic
928S. 4spd Auto (no..I know the "man" goes faster..but I wanted the auto
OK!!? :^)

It is EVERYTHING I expected!! ...(including the things that needed
fixing!) above all it is truly the
sensational car of my dreams!

Some of the things that needed fixing:

Straight up ....a new battery :(
Airconditioning ...Electrical short and a re-gassing
A host of minor electrical repairs to mirror, pass seat, rear wiper,
rear hatch release, high beam relay..phew!! :^)
New expansion tank for the radiator
New air hose to air filter (to match the other side!)
Set of locking wheel nuts - Tracker alarm is on the wish list for next
year!
New drivers door latch - (The door kept coming ajar at speed!!)

I took the baby (and the SO) to the Porsche Club of New South Wales,
Christmas Run to the "Blue Mountains"
(approx 50 mins west of Sydney) ...a very pleasant experience! I chased
another 928S up the
"Bells Line of Road" (the "twisty" and "preffered" back way up to the
mountains) and it went like a rocket!
Glen's 928S is a manual ..however I didnt feel as though I was at a
disadvantage having the auto!

Leaving three 911s' in our wake!! :^) we continued up until we met up
with a larger group that had left earlier.
All in all there were over fifty Porsches of all colours and models
arriving at the resort for the Lunch.
Happily Glen and my 928S  (the only 2!) sat nicely in amongst the
various air-cooled siblings and a few 944s'

The 928S is a joy to drive..reading all the stories on this list about
the various trips made has been a real pleasure.
Now I can write my own stories. It's true...you DO want to take it on
long trips..its SUCH a joy, I find every time I return from a journey, I
want to turn around and go somewhere else!! (WARNING! this car is
ADDICTIVE!!).

Right now it feels (touch wood!) as though it is complete..everything
works as advertised, doors, windows, mirrors, seats and sunroof .....man
this IS an ELECTRIC car!! The new battery turns the 4.7 ltr engine over
without fuss.
Starts first time EVERYTIME!   How does it sound? Fan-BLOODY-tastic! :^)
A friend in the club reckons
I look TEN YEARS younger!! :^) ...and who am I to argue!! <grin>

Do you ALL drive along with that smile PERMANENTLY fixed to your dial ??
Well I think you get the idea!

Next year is a big year for PORSCHE,  it's the 50th anniversary year and
there is going to be a big event
staged in Melbourne in November..read about it in the PCNSW Web Site at:

http://www.ozemail.com.au/~mechanic/

Merry Christmas to all on the list and your families. Above all ....safe
driving in your Landshark!

Regards,

Leonard Zech
