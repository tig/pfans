<<Subject: re: Speeding Ticket

To: 928@porschefans.com

From: "Christopher T. Joffe" <joffe@ibm.net>



From what I have been told by MANY people, fight ALL tickets.  The worst



that will happen is that you end up with the original cost of the ticket

(as if

you'd never fought it.)>>

Not even remotely true.  The worst that happens is the judge raises the fine
to the statutory maximum.  The bail listed on the ticket is what you will be
allowed to pay if you do so without a trial (if that is even an option on that
particular ticket, which most simple speeding tickets are).  

A judge has full discretion to fine you to the maximum allowed by statute for
the offense you have been convicted of in court.  

I have had my fine raised twice.  Once just last june.  From $99 to $150.  And
I flew from Virginia to Oregon to make the appearance.  However, I knew what I
was getting into, and I knew that I should have paid the ticket when I found
out what judge I was assigned.  But, I had flown all the way there, and I'll
pay $50 to make the cop shake with anger about being made to draw pictures,
and not knowing where speed limit signs are posted, and not knowing exactly
what the speed limit was where I was pulled over, and not knowing how far we
traveled from when his lights were on, and not knowing where we stopped
finally.

It was great fun.  It was also worth the $50 when the judge said to me, "I
wouldn't have that license plate on my car (MR-WRNG)", and then I got to
sweetly respond, "Well, Judge, you couldn't because I already have it."

Heh, heh, heh.

Oh well, the point is:  make an informed decision about what your time is
potentially worth, and what your chances are in winning or getting it lowered.

<<There has been at least

one incident where a wheel split under hard cornering and braking.

Fortunately, only slight body damage was the outcome.



For street driving, chromed wheels will probably be ok. If you plan to do

PCA Driver's Ed events, but must have shiny wheels, polish them.?>>

Ed-  

You knew I would be one to disagree.  Considering we have already had this
conversation with regard to polishing.  

There is NO evidence that the wheel you mention above split because of
chroming.  So it isn't relevant.

Chromed wheels for street driving will "probably" be ok?  They are most
definitely ok on tens of thousands of cars each and evey day.  

Where is the metallurgist that answered my questions about polishing several
months ago.  

Sorry Ed.  I don't have chrome wheels, but I am argumentative AND curious.  So
this is purely and academic excercise for me.  If anyone can explain why or
why not wheels should not be chromed, please do.  I am interested in knowing
if the heat range of the chroming process can actually weaken the temper of
the wheel.  

Ed-  do you have any info on the 3P event, in terms of 928 relevancy?  I see
it is in your region, and am thinking about going.  Will you be there?  Anyone
else going?

Also, did the license plate photos from the frenzy turn out?  I was thinking
that they  would make a good composite photo.

<<With the exception of a few sarcastic remarks (no offense taken), the list

members provided no explanation for the variance.  I was waiting for a

highly regarded and enlightened member to provide an "everyone knows why"

justification. Your explanation would certainly go a long way toward

helping me justify having way too much money in my 928.  Did I mention it

was a 1984?>>

There was sarcasm for two reasons:

1)  The prices overall were not indicative of presently prevailing market
prices

2)  The prices for the '84 were laughably high.  Probably just a simple
mistake in copying the information into an email.

<<finally the question:  does an 86 928s have a similar tesioning system with

the rubbing block that wears and breaks, I have an 86 928s I just bought with

75k miles on it and am concerned that a cheap piece of plastic may ruin my

day.



Thanks

Glenn >>

I guess the shop you work at doesn't touch 928's.  Heh, heh, heh.

Well, I don't know the answer, but thought it interesting that the people you
work with wouldn't know the answer.
