Dear fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

I just want to invite all of you to the Potomac Region's "Porsche
Performance Products Exposition" (P3 Expo). The Date is January 31, 1998,
from noon till 5:00 p.m. The location is at the Hyatt Regency, Reston Town
Center in Reston, VA. The cost to all attendees is ZERO.

Although this event is not specifically geared to 928s, it is focused on
"Porsche".
I plan to be there for the entire session and would very much like to meet
you at the event.

For more info on the event, go to the Potomac Region's home page:
pcapotomac.org

Happy motoring and holidays. Ed

In a message dated 12/19/97 9:59:46 PM, you wrote:

<<With all the stuff you mention that the cop didn't know when you 
examined him, what reason did the judge give for RASING your fine, 
instead of throwing out the ticket? Isn't the point of fighting a 
ticket that you show it more likely than not that what the cop alleged 
on his ticket was false? And with all the weaknesses you pointed out, 
it would appear you should have succeeded.>>

I did succeed.  But when you are in a statutory court (as opposed to
constitutional court), in front of a cop's judge (if you know what I mean),
your better bet is to be remorseful and apologetic and hope for a reduced
charge (in this case there wasn't any available to a simple speeding ticket)
and reduced fine.  I just didn't feel like playing the game that day.  I have
before, but wasn't in the mood.  

The reason a judge will take a lot of leeway with the burdens and evidentiary
proof is exactly as you state:  more likely than not, or better described as
"a preponderance of the evidence".  51% or greater.  It is all a matter of
testimony at this point, and who are you gonna believe?  In this case it was
the officer.  

Also since it is a statutory court there is an appeal as a matter of right for
any reason whatsoever.  What this means is a trial de novo.  A brand new
trial.  The judge also knows this, and acts accordingly.  This process is used
to unclog the courts.  Most people wont appeal, and in this case I didn't find
it possible being so far away from the venue.  

Now keep in mind, some judges follow the rules and don't grant special
consideration to cop's testimony that appears faulty and unreliable.  Some do.
My judge did not.  And I knew she wouldn't when I went in there.  I already
had the word on her, and decided to have some fun.  At least it was fun to me
to see the cop's jaw muscles twitching in anger and frustration.  

<<Maybe it was because you called the judge "judge" and not "your 
honour" when replying to his MR WRNG remark.>>

Nothing at all to do with it.  In fact, it is overwhelmingly likely that I did
indeed say "your honor".  I have excellent courtroom etiquette.  No joke.  

<<The reason I am particularly curious is that I went to court over a 
ticket once, and was all brimming with confidence about mistakes and 
sloppyness evident on the ticket, and how that would get me off free. 
And I could never test that theory because the cop didn't show (so I 
still walked off free, which I'm happy about; but it leaves we wanting 
to know what would have happened).>>

Well, now you know what one of the scenarious could have been.  Also, if I
would have been in front of the regular judge for the trial, I probably would
have walked.  He doesn't do any favors for sloppy police, and unreliable
testimony.  He demands that you do your work properly as a police officer.

God this is depressing :( 
Oh well, cash needed, I have to sell.

1988 928-S4 5spd. Red w/camel interior. 90k miles. 2nd owner. New timing belt,
clutch, radiator, brakes, etc. - $9,600 in receipts for work done in last 18
months. Runs like a dream, tight, perfect. Immaculately kept. 

Could use new tires and brake pads. Stunning car.

Hello!

I tried to post the following message to this list last week, but it never
appeared there.
Meanwhile, I have learned from John White that the oil consumption topic was
already discussed. Anybody remember roughly when this was, so that I can check
the archive?
Also, nothing personal Jeroan, I know it must have been a rough week...

Original message:

>Hi everybody!

>I'm fairly new to this list, have been lurking in the shadows for a week or
two and >now feel compelled to post this mail. Basically, there are three
things I'd like to >address:

>1. To those who plan to visit the Porsche factory:

>The address of the factory is: Dr.Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG
                                            Porschestr. 42 (what a
coincidence....)
                                            70435 Stuttgart
>Their phone # has changed, it is now ++49 711 911-0 (some person in marketing
>got a raise for that idea...), not sure what the number for the museum is,
though.

>The in-house-928-guru is a guy called von Dueren, don't know about his
foreign >language (i.e. English) skills, though.

>2. My tech question: What is the average oil consumption of fairly hard
driven >928's out there? I recently drove from Baden-Baden (where I currently
live) to >Munich in a hurry (210 miles in 1:50 h), in moderate traffic, which
involved lots of >kick-down (some people think they should bumble along at 100
mph in the left >lane on the 'Bahn, more about that below...) doing an
indicated 180 mph where I >could, but having to slow down to 90 mph or so
frequently. In Munich I had to >refill about one litre of oil, which seems a
lot to me. Even when taking it easy, a >litre/1000 km (600 mi) is always
necessary. I bought the car (87 S4 auto >(obviously)) earlier this year (my
first 928) with 30 k miles on the odometer (only >been driven in the summer,
always washed by hand, etc) in perfect condition >inside and out. Some friends
driving behind me (only for a short time, I assure >you) noted a small amount
of blue smoke  when I hit kick-down, but nothing >excessive. There are no
visible oil leaks. Any opinions?

>3. Hey Gene O'Rourke, are you out there? I understand you realized that your
>first "Chessehead"-reply was a little harsh, but *please* do *not* encourage
>cheeseheads to "go out and play in the left hand lane of the Autobahn"!!!!
It's bad >enough out there as it is, especially in the summer months!!! Stay
in the right >lane, pleeeease.

>Thanks for your attention, anybody in the area (close to Stuttgart at the
edge of >the Black Forest; we have a casino here) feel free to stop by.
