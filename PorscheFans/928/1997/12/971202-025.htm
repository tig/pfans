First of all, I'm sorry about your loss. I hope you have a good punching
bag.

928s are rare. They are stolen less often than other cars. Statistically in
past years 2-3 year old buicks have been the #1 most commonly stolen
vehicle. When cars like ours are stolen  it is to fill a specific order. 
(Or joyriders) A Pro will get your car no matter what you do, club and all.

My roomate had his Suzuki Bandit (Ladder type frame, nice bike) stolen two
weekends ago from our house. After a day of rage and sadness, we came home
to found that the thief had driven it back to the nightclub next to our
house and abandoned it. Possibly a joyrider? Of course when my Moms truck
was stolen they found it 6 years later in Sonora Mexico. None of my cars
have ever been stolen. Although I lost my 3rd car stereo Thanksgiving eve'
out of my truck. One problem a thief might encounter is that none of my
vehicles will move more than 3 or 4 feet without 'running out of gas'
because their fuel systems dont get any power unless I say so.

I would get another 928. If you dont you are letting the thief win. You are
letting some prick who deserves to be pummeled to death scare you out of
driving something you enjoy.

Now that you've had the horrible experience, your next 928 can be a little
safer. You can use the club, install a fuel system kill device. (One of
those systems where you pull out a second 'key' and leave the circuit open)
And a lojack. When I get my 928 out of the shop one of the first things I
am going to do is get lojack installed. (I dont have theft insurance, too
costly for me right  now)

If you aren't familiar with lojack it is a device that is hidden in your
car, and allows police to triangulate its position when activated. Every
lojack installer puts their device in different locations, so they are very
difficult to find and disable. Here in San Diego the vehicle recovery rate
(when using lojack) is very high. Plus you are doing a community service
because when they find your car the thief is not far behind. (Prosecute,
Prosecute)

Why dont you give us a description for your car. Im sure we can all keep an
eye out at our local dismantlers. (Where DOES my local guy get all his
cherry 928s anyway?) Even though your insurance company would no doubt own
the car by the time any of us found it, it would sure as hell make me feel
better. :)

Any lawyers on this list? I have always wondered the legality of putting a
device under your seat, very simple in fact, that would 'disable' a would
be thief. Several chemical agents could be used to do this, with varying
degrees of 'disabledment'. My simple device involves a small pressure plate
under your seat, a canister of aforementioned agent, and a pin, which, when
someone were to sit on the seat, would puncture the can. Two designs I have
come up with allow you to either remove the pin or remove the canister. I
prefer the second, allowing you to put the canister in a safe location
where it wouldnt be punctured in an accident. We cant put in a 'hold him
down and fry him' system like in Robocop.... But maybe we can keep them,
and our car, in the driveway?
