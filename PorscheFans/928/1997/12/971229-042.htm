> Hello everyone,

Hi Carlos!

>The shop that I took the car to is called "Lomita 911 Service", 
>the porsche mechanic there mentioned that he prefers working on 911's.

Carlos, I also live in PV and have been taking my car to Lomita 911 for
several years as well as our Mercedes.  Dieter, the owner, has a 928 of his
own and he has worked on mine.  Derrick is probably the most experienced on
the 928, while the other gentleman who works there is 911-centric.  This is
not a 928 shop per se, but every time I go by, there's at least one and
sometimes 2 or 3 928's in for maintenance.

I recommend Dieter and Lomita 911 based on my past experience.  He's been
fair to me and has done a pretty good job.  

Welcome to 928-land and I like your idea about a get-together somewhere
here in the south bay.
