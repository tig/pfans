James,

Re: your post on tires.  I've been driving 928s as long as they've made =
them and have tried lots of different tires.  I've had good luck with =
Pirellis, Fuldas, and Bridgestones.  I've been running Toyo Proxes until =
recently.  Expensive, and never gripped the road like some others.  I =
replaced the front tires with Dunlop D40-M2s a few weeks ago and they =
drove me crazy.  They sang like snowtires.  I took the car back to the =
dealer and he replaced them with SP 8000s which are considerably more =
costly but he only charged me the difference between them and the D40s =
which worked out to just under $100.00.  Not a bad deal seeing as I had =
put a couple of thousand miles on them.  The SP 8000s are much quieter =
and are better tires all around.  A long winded reply to your query, but =
I noticed that D40-M2s were one of your possible choices.

Gene O'Rourke
