Aaaaaarrrrrggggghhhhhh!

At the risk of being flamed for sarcasm just let me say that the "delete"
is wearing off of my delete key. Can we develop a new virus that eats posts
with the same subject when they number more than two or three? It could be
enhanced to recognize junk mail and mlm scam/spam stuff as well. Could be a
programming challenge that would elevate one of our ranks to "Most Exhalted."

Maybe it could be called "post nuke" or "ibid eater" or "ditto death."

ps and by the way, I think that the biting satire on this list is more than
appropriate. I think the apostrophe stuff is hilarious. The level of
intelligence and diversity in this group is awe inspiring. Don't let a few
curmudgeon's (and I looked up the spelling) spoil what is entertaining and
healthy banter. 

(If a cheesehead is sitting in a sports seat with enhanced lateral
support....)
