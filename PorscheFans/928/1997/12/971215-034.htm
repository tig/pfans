This gauge claims to be indicating your instantaneous fuel consumption,
measured in liters per 100 kilometers (so a higher number means worse gas
mileage, as it would if you tracked gallons per mile; 6 liters/100km = 1.59
gallons/62.14 miles = 0.026 gallons/mile, equivalent to 39 mpg; 18 l/100km
is thus equivalent to 13 mpg).

It would be nice if this gauge actually received continuos measurements of
fuel flow (in, say, liters per second) and vehicle road speed (in, say,
km/hr) and did the division on the fly, and it very well may (modern
electronic fuel injection control systems could work out this calculation
from the info they monitor).

However, there was a time when cars (clearly not supercharged) came with
manifold vacuum gauges which were highly speculatively calibrated in miles
per gallon; this is probably beneath Porsche's dignity.
