I did this too and like the resulting clean appearance, but this part
weighs enough more than the foam sheet that it will overcome the hood
shocks if they're not at full strength, causing a gradual descent (e.g., on
your head while you're working).

Now that I have your attention.

If anyone is around the Fairfield, CT area could you stop by Continental
Motors, Inc. and check out a white and navy '93 GTS auto for me.  Ask for Al
Vancheska (or something like that) and tell him you are there to look at the
car for James Morrison.  We talked today (12/8/97 at 4:30 CST).  He does not
work on Wed but he is there the rest of the work week.

He said that the doors had been keyed and repainted (poorly apparently) and I
would like to know how bad that is.  Are there full service records with the
car.  What condition is the carpet and seating surfaces in.  Does the engine
bay look good and clean.  He said something about having had the wheels redone
too.

Let me know what you think and if it is worth about $38k...I think that was
the asking price anyway.  Seems high to me.  Should be a perfect '93 with
fewer miles and then $38k would be ok, this sounds more like a $32k car to me,
but I sure would appreciate someone taking a look at if for me and letting me
know what you think.

TIA,
James Morrison
