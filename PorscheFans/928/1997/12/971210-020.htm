For now I will enjoy my Weissach rear ended, skinny tired, non- s4 braked,
old shark. I know you guys with the super trick, 4 valve, fat tired guys
think I can't be having any fun but this car still scares the hell out of
me when I drive it on twisty back roads in Vermont. Yeehaw!

Jay,

As the owner of a factory-tricked, 4 valve, semi-fat tyred 928 I would like to
HEARTILY reinforce that I would NEVER imply, think or suggest that your
928 doesn't provide you with fun!!  (Mind you - I am not certain that having
my car "scare the hell out of me" is my definition of fun!  I know, I know - I 
am deliberately taking you too literally there!)

I used to have an early Esprit S1 and the guys in the club who owned turbos
always implied that my car wasn't as much fun.  Sure, it wasn't as fast, but
it was AWEsome fun.  Your 928, I am certain, is the same only better!

Regards,

Philip Adamson
