Hey guys,

Any ideas with this one?

Twice now, since I got my 928 a few weeks ago, the thing won't start 
when I turn the key.  The Porsche immobiliser seems to have worked okay, 
all the ignition lights come on and the LED glows continually - but the 
starter motor just won't engage.

On both occasions leaving the car for ten minutes or so and then trying 
again seems to work.  Spoke to my local Porsche dealers and they 
suggested the auto-box inhibitor switch may be playing up, but jiggling 
the selector doesn't seem to make any difference, the car won't start in 
either Neutral or Park, and the leaving it alone bit points more to the 
immobiliser I reckon.  On both occasions the car was parked on a 
downward slope, although this may be coincidental and irrelevant.

I could hear a relay clicking as I turned the key, which rules out the 
ignition switch I think and if this is the starter motor relay could it 
be the starter motor itself?

If only the problem were consistent, I could get the car recovered and 
get it fixed, but it's only happened twice now and both times gone away 
after 10 minutes or so.  It just means I've no confidence the car will 
start when I turn the key at the moment - kind of takes away from the 
928 bliss I'd come to know.

Anyone any similar experience?

Does anyone on the list have experience with the throttle body mod that AJ USA
markets.  they do machine work on an exchange basis.
what kind of power if any can I expect?  any drivability problems? will it
effect any of my vac operated accesories?
Thanks
