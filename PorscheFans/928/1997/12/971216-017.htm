In response to the numerous queries regarding the problems with battery
drainage and theft concerns, here is a little tid-bit that my PO clued me
in on.  If you remove the rear panel in the "luggage compartment" which
houses the tool-kit, you will notice a wing-nut approximately 1-inch in
diameter which is bolting something to the frame.  That "something" is the
negative ground for the battery.  My PO recommended that if I let the car
sit idle for more than a week or so, I should unscrew the wing-nut and
disconnect the ground.  This will keep your battery from discharging, as
well as, the added benefit of disabling your ignition from would-be
thieves.  Of course the unfortunate side-effect is that it also disables
anything working off the battery while the ignition is off (i.e. the
alarm).  I guess your faith in the factory alarm will determine whether you
consider this an added security measure or a detriment.

As a disclaimer, I have to add that I have not yet tried this since I can't
seem to let the car sit for more than a week anyway.
Let me know if anyone else has tried this.
