Dear sharkers,
    I have enjoyed the recent dicussion on tyres. My 928s has Japanese =
Goodyear Ducaros F1 and they have served well. I have a question about =
my wheels. They look similar to those on S4's or GT"s. A couple off =
weeks ago someone on the list mentioned the rim size is near the valve. =
Mine has a couple of letters there that look MC and one has the  brand =
name VIA. They measure 7.5'' front and 8.5'' rear. Are they after market =
wheels?
    Also my odometer and trip meter do not work. One rare occasions the =
tacho and speedo  decide not to work, I presume a poor earth for them. =
The odometer seems more serious. Any one else had this problem?
    Regards,
    Graham Bates
