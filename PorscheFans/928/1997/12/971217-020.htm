With full respect to Brian and his suggestions, I take a more conservative
view and recommend that you have the same brand and model of tire on all
four wheels (the sizes will, of course, be different front to rear). This
is most important if you're cornering at or near the limit of adhesion,
where you explore the details of the way in which the tire breaks away.

Two different sport tires may have about the same overall level of
adhesion, but one may break away gradually (e.g., the Bridgestone Potenza
S-02) and another more abruptly (e.g., the Michelin Pilot SX MXX3). If the
two ends of the car disagree at such a critical moment, you could have an
interesting crisis to resolve RIGHT NOW.

First, decide what balance of characteristics you want. The highest
performance tires (e.g., the two I just mentioned) are balanced primarily
for maximum stick at extreme speeds on dry, warm roads. They're OK in the
rain, but can get stupid even on dry roads when the temperature gets below
freezing, and don't handle snow very well. The next step down in summer
performance (e.g., Michelin Pilot XGT Z4) are still terrific sport tires
but handle rain better, stay sticky at winter temperatures, and have some
tread siping to get a bite on snow. They also cost significantly less than
the top tires.

>Are snow tires even worth considering or are they available?

There are speed-rated true snow (not "all-season", which tend not to handle
snow well) tires (e.g., Michelin XM+S 330, rated for a sustained 130 mph
and available in S4 stock sizes), so you can have maximum performance
summer tires and change to snows for the winter without losing much
capability. If you do this, consider laying out even more money for another
set of wheels so that all the tires can stay mounted.
