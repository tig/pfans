During my retirement between jobs, I had the honor and privilive of
working as an inspector (tester) for Texas when they started up the
centeral run state test facilities.

We worked part time, 20 hr./week at mim wage, $7.50 and went to a day
training class where we were taught to set up the car, do the prelim.
checks, and run the car on the dymo. 

The car was driven on to the rolls, the front wheels were chocked, and
the test inspector got onboard. In Texas we had a profile on a t.v.
monitor, and to pass the test the car speed had to be within the bounds
of the profile, and if it dropped out for over 1.0 sec.(as I remember)
it would fail and you did the run again.

When we started we practiced with our own vehicles. I had my 300 zx I
did twice, and that was enough. I'm here to tell you it was no 2500 rpm
jaunt. The manuals transmittions were tough because the test people had
to learn the clutch and that made for some intresting test runs. The guy
from Ohio had it right, if you missed a gear, it wasn't good. Some of
the test speeds were up to 60 mph (again as I remember), the tests were
set up to test at road speeds and that's what they did. It was a
simulation of a short city drive. A start up, up and down speed drive,
and a ramp entry and freeway sprint. I remember someone saying the test
was recorded by someone doing a run around Austin or somewhere. At any
rate, it was not a simple runup and cruise test.

We did on some occasions let the owner drive the car. If they made it
through the profile, it was all over. If not, do it again. In our
defence I will say that by the second or third week, we had things down
pretty good, and seldom made a blunder, but it did happen. 

The outcry from the local garages forced the state to do away with
central test stations and let the garages buy some sniffers,etc., and
changed the test so it could be done stationary. It also caused a
multi-million dollar lawsuit against the state because they had
contracted with, and sold franchises to people to setup and operate the
central test sites and after about three months of testing, pulled the
rug out from under them by canceling the central test facility.

Enough history. Emmissions testing is not for the ecology, it's for the
money. Just like speeding tickets are for highway safety. There is a
grain of truth to it all, but the bottom line is still the "bottom
line", and that's how speed traps came to be.

I said I'd try to be more concise, I guess I lied, but I'm still trying.

 Looking forward to seeing lots of 928'ers in Dallas on the 6 th.
Have a good day all.
