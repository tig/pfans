A Hearty thanks to all who responded to my plea for help on 12/26 (Clutch
Trauma): you folks helped to restore my faith in the nobility of people and
in the general worth of the Internet as a medium for human communication. 

Here's where I am: removed the slave cylinder for the clutch (after a mildly
painful journey up the ramps) and disassembled: it appears the big rubber
bushing was worn and probably contracted in sub-zero temp.s, thus failing. 
I think I spotted a small puddle of brake fluid in that approx. area once
the vehicle was moved (hard to tell amongst the snow, weeds and stains left
by vehicle normally parked there). Here's the plan: get a replacement unit and
return to scenic Steamboat and replace. Seems simple--the part is one of the 
few accessible things underneath and has a bleeder valve. 

My question: since the brakes and clutch share the same fluid reservoir,
will it be necessary to also bleed the brakes? (They seem fine at this
point). Any other tips from those who have had this problem? I'm also
considering having the old unit rebuilt as a backup (it's small enough to
stow in a number of places); any info about the frequency of slave cylinder
failure out there?

Since I'm back in the metro area, please send responses to sdp@commerce.com.

Many Thanks,

Steve Peterson

PS--I spent 3 years in Steamboat as a wayward ski bum, so if anyone has
questions about the area (i.e. for the gathering scheduled this summer),
I may be able to offer tips and such: e.g. the relative quality of hotels,
restaurants, good places to camp, hike, etc. Either mail me directly or 
post to the list. As I recently discovered, be forewarned that parts and
service are slim to none for P-cars in the 'Boat (multiple day wait to ship
from Denver). If there's sufficient interest, perhaps a FAQ is in order?
