Hello sharkites,

I've done some investigation on my hot-start problem, following
recommendations 
of many of you.

Here's the symptoms:

With the engine warm (5 mins of idling will do), shut it off.  Try to
start it again...it
barely starts & dies within 1 second, or doesn't start at all.  Starter
motor
cranks and cranks, no igniting of fuel at all.   Wait 10-20 minutes, and
it starts
right up.  Always starts immediately when cold.

Here's what I've done:

 - fuel pressure check (OK)
 - ignition spark check (OK)
 - replaced all 3,523,165 rubber hoses and vac lines
 - idle checked (cold = about 1000, hot = 750)
 - tried bumping the hot idle up to about 850, no effect

The problem happens about half the time.  Usually, it's at a gas station
(otherwise,
I'll generally have stopped long enough for it to restart).  Once it's
running, it runs
perfectly.

My guesses at this point:

1.	temp sensor I or II
2.	cold start valve?
3.	hot start valve (I saw a pic in the shop manuals, not sure if my
car
	has one...haven't investigated this thoroughly enough)

I think it has to be temp related--I don't think it's vaccuum line
pressure draining
away that makes it start again after 10-20 mins.

Opinions?
