Great!

>My wife likes them :-)

Also very good.

>I am also going down to the local bookstores and find some 928 books,
>any reccomendations?

Uh, oh.  Book notes again.  But at least they have good lateral support :)

Seriously, your local bookstore may not have anything on them as the books
are somewhat few and far between.

Probably the best one is:

Porsche 928 Performance Portfolio $20 and it covers from the early ones to
the GTS models.

My local bookstore couldn't get it, but you can from Devek (they have some
other 928 stuff as they are performance gurus for these cars) at www.devek.net

And another place would be Classic Motorbooks, which is like
www.motorbooks.com or www.classicmotorbooks.com, I'm not sure which or if
that's even right.  But you can call them at 1-800-826-6600 for a free catalog.

If you're quick, check your local bookstores the latest Excellence magazine
(all about Porsches).  They have 2 928 articles this month.  One is on
buying and current pricing (which has been discussed here) and the other is
on the Devek 928 with loads of mods and top speeds nearing 200.

Also, be watching for the new issues of European Car as they will be having
an article in the next few months on buying 928 and the things that can be
done with them.
