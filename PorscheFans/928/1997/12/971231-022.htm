Drawing on my experience from modifying my Porsche 928, I can say this is
right and wrong.

If you have a bone stock M3, don't expect much from any "cat-back" exhaust,
*except*

1. A nice sound!
2. Nice chrome look with fat outlets
3. Long lasting stainless construction (from only some manufacturer's)


Maybe you'll get 5-8 HP max, and only showing up at high revs.

Remember, you still have the same header design and catalytic convertor,
which is restricing flow considerably, these act the bottle necks. On my
Porsche, I changed the headers to a set designed by Devek Performance using
old Can-Am technology, and I eliminated the catalytic convertor (do not do
this if you plan on driving on the street), then had a 3.5" tube all the
way to one Borla XR-1 racing muffler. This setup is VERY loud, especially
when its connected to the 928's V8 (I eventually switched to two mufflers
just to tone down the sound). But this is a REAL performance exhaust, that
gives REAL hp gains. I dynoed the car and got a 41 hp increase, at the rear
wheels !! (53 hp at the flywheel). These numbers were with the below mated
mods.


But remember, all a freer exhaust will do is allow the engine to breathe
better on the exhaust cycle, you have to modify the induction system, which
is what I did by extrudehoning the induction system (runners, plenum), and
going to a K&N dual cone filter system, and extrude honing the throttle
body. I also installed a camshaft with a more aggressive lobe profile, and
an adjustable fuel pressure regulator. I also did a few other minor tweeks
such as switching from a fan clutch to electric fans, etc.

The bottom line was that my 928  put out 369 HP at the flywheel, and does
0-60 in 5.1-5.3, all with bullet proof engine reliability! On a side note,
I think its important to note that torque was affected less substantially.
These kind of mods are "squeeze the last drop of HP out at high revs" type
mods, if you want a real step up in torque and hp throughout the entire
powerband (which will be power that will be useful on the street as well as
the track), you have to either increase displacement, turbo, or
supercharge. You can only do so much to an already great motor (ie. most
all Porsche motors, some BMW motors) without going to more cubic
centimeters or forced induction.
