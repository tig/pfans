Adam,

I totally agree with your project, but have a few thoughts and comments:

Why change the body??  The 928 S4 has a nice efficient shape, a frontal area
of about 21 sq ft and a cd of 0.34.  Start adding flares and extras and you will
begin to defeat your own goal by making the machine harder to push through
the air, this making the top speed of over 200 mph harder to achieve.

First, the car already IS a supercar!!  Duh!!  You (like me) just want to put
it into the McLaren F1 league.  That's a different story.

I've been running simulations and computer modeling this stuff.  400 lb ft
or torque along with 500 bhp will do the trick, according to my initial calcs.
You'd need the 2.2 diff (the ratio that the automatic has), you'd need the
engine balanced to do 7000 rpm, and you'll probably go for wider rear tyres
to try and keep the power where you want it.

As for the parts to achieve all this... (Susan?  I'm sure you've got some
thoughts?)  I'm in New Zealand, far too far away to research it all easily, 
but the Devek 6 litre kit looks like a good start.  Other people will have 
better input than mine here - I know what the goal is, what the needs are, 
I just haven't found the most cost effective way of achieving it.  Yet.

I'll look forward to following this project.  It's a topic quite dear to me
right now, as I'm planning a similar path with mine, just not in the immediate
future.
