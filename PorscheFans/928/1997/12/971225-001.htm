Happy Holidays to all members of the group.

Couple of things.  In yesterday's post Bill Parrish mentioned that he =
averages 12 miles to the gallon.  Bill, your car should get better =
mileage than that at 150 miles an hour!  Something is drastically wrong. =
 I've never had worse than 17mpg around town or 22-24 mpg on trips, and =
thats in seven different 928s. Do you possibly have teen aged neighbors =
who own a siphon hose?

Secondly, all this esoteric talk about the relative merits of different =
kinds of oil and which brands last longer etc. baffles me.  I can't =
remember ever having to add a quart of oil to any of my 928s between =
changes and I usually change the oil about every 6000 miles even though =
the owners manual says 15000 miles is okay.  Also, I don't baby these =
cars, I drive them as hard as they were designed to be driven.

All members of the group who are constantly discussing the above, should =
have a July 1996 copy of Consumer Reports.  They did a major long term =
test of motor oils.  They took 75 New York City taxicabs and tested them =
over a period of two years..  Anyone who's ever spent much time in =
Manhattan knows the horrendous conditions these cabs are run under. =20
Just for starters, temperature differentials of over 100 degrees, =
constant heavy braking and accelerating, 24hour days, general abuse, =
etc.

They used all brands and viscosities, synthetics as well as regular, =
etc. etc.
they changed oil in the cabs every 6000 miles.  They all had over 60,000 =
miles put on them during the test period.  At the end of that time they =
tore the engines down in all 75 cabs, and guess what they found? Wonder =
of wonders!  It didn't make a damned bit of difference what brand or =
whether the oil was regular or synthetic. All engines had about the same =
degree of wear!

The magazine obviously goes into much greater detail.  The article looks =
like it's probably at least four or five thousand words, replete with =
charts, graphs, etc. as I recall.  I would imagine that copies could be =
obtained by contacting the magazine.

Lastly, several members have likened driving their cars to wet dreams =
come true etc.  I can understand their feelings, after driving them for =
20 years the damned things grow on you like barnacles.  I have other, =
much newer, quieter, cars with all the bells and whistles but find =
myself driving my ten year old 928 most of the time.  They/it have/has =
become like an extension of my body.  When driving other cars I find =
myself unconsciously reaching for controls, switches, etc. where logic =
and Dr. Porsche deemed they should be, and being somewhat irked at the =
obvious stupidity of their designers for failing to recognize that =
simple ergonomic fact.

I have therefore informed members of my family that upon my demise,  I =
wish to be stuffed and mounted, with my Stirling Moss driving shoes, =
Juan Fangio helmet, and Dan Gurney nomex driving suit on (which will =
prabably come in handy where I expect to be),  Sat behind the wheel of =
the freshly detailed car with Linda Ronstadt and Nelson Riddle playing =
softly on the stereo, and lowered into a 928S4 sized resting place.  =
Except for one brother who is also a long time Porsche addict, the rest =
of the family thinks I'm sick, but wait till they open my will and =
discover that I'm serious!

Merry Christmas and a great 928 "98"

Merry Christmas everyone,  I posted this before but never recieved any
responses.

I am putting the interior back into the car and the switches in the pod cover,
headlight, hazards...etc.... they go in fine but when I twist them it dosen't
catch. I can basically turn them around in circles if I wanted to. They are on
right with the clips bieng vertically.  Is there any tricks to them? Any
solutions? Any help is appreaciated, thanks a lot,
