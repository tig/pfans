Texas 928 fans! For a couple of months now we Austin folks have had the
benefit of our own mailing list for local discussions like getting tips
on local service and planning events. So far, we have organized group
attendance at the Round Rock Car Show, a Fourth of July gathering, trips
to Texas World Speedway, a tour of Ft. Hood, and the Dallas Mini-Frenzy.

In any case, this keeps us from tying up the main list with traffic
most of you could care less about. At our mini-frenzy last weekend,
Sterling Gee and I thought it would be a good idea to expand this to
DFW and all-of-Texas (and surrounding) lists. This is definitely how
we will organize the next Texas Mini-Frenzy. If you think we need yet
another Texas regional list, join texas-928 and tell us about it!

Please note that these lists are for local discussion only. Topics of
general 928 interest should still go through 928@porschefans.com.

You are hereby invited to join us. Please see the following URL for
subscription details. If you don't have web access and still need help
(note: majordomo@wolfeden.org), feel free to send me mail asking.

Most of the site graphics still say `Austin 928 Mailing List', but I'll
get that updated to `Texas 928 Mailing Lists' soon.
