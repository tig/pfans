I know I posted earlier this year, and there was a two-week thread about
fuel additives.   But, just for argument sake, here's my .02 worth:

Having lived six years in Wisconsin and during that time dealing with
storage of cars, boats, chainsaws, lawnmowers, motorcycles, etc., I've
come to the conclusion that Sta-Bil is best used when the stored item is
in a heated area.   If stored in a pole barn, for example, Sta-Bil has
no appreciative effect compared with 'unprotected' engines.   No science
here, just personal observation.

I often had trouble getting a 'Sta-Bil'ed engine running and tuned after
treatment, but really had no trouble at all with engines left alone
(other than fogging) at storage time.   If these items were going to be
stored longer than one year, it may be a different story.   My
experience convinced me to quit using the stuff and concentrate on other
aspects of storage.

Good luck to all putting their sharks to temporary sleep!

Eric,

I too have heard of the electrical gremlins in the 850CSi.  My friend who
recently sold his gorgeous 1994 Alpine White 850CSi had problems with the CD
changer and BMW installed phone from day one.  Besides the problems with the
stereo and cellular equipment, and the fact that it had no resale value, he
loved the car.  You mentioned that an electronic brain control had to be
replaced on an 850 by your mechanic, wouldn't that normally be covered under
BMW warranty?  I know that my 1994 325iC (which I sold a month ago)  had
terrific warranty coverage.  I am thinking about having the best of both
worlds, I have my 928S which I love and probably wouldn't part with, but I
found a 1994 Black/Black 850CSi with 29,000 miles at an insurance salvage
facility in Detroit.  The car needs some sheetmetal (hood, front fender and
headlight assy.) and some bang out work in a few other areas, I haven't heard
back from the dealer, but at the moment, I am assuming the car is in perfect
mechanical condition, besides the fact that it needs one rim to be driveable.
The reason it caught my eye is because it has a clean title and they are
asking only $36,000 O.B.O.  Not bad for a car which cost $108,000 three years
ago.  I am also waiting to hear back from a BMW dealer on how much parts would
be.  Well, that is my .928 + .850 cents.
