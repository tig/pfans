1K miles is a little excessive for oil changes; I know certain zealots who
do the same. My mechanic recommended 6000KM between oil changes, which is
3750 miles or so. I usually go a bit less than this. At the rate I drive my
car, I'd be changing the oil every three weeks. Come on, let's get real.
There is a gadget that is available in a few stores, and Griot's Garage by
mail order. It sucks the old oil out via the dipstick, and then you fill it
on top through the filler. The only thing I don't like about this is that
if by chance you have some filings or debris in the bottom of the pan,
you'll never know about it because the thing can't usually suck all the way
to the bottom. Good for a quickie change, though.
