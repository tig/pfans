 I have taken everyone's feedback into account regarding what a 928 needs
to break the 200MPH barrier. I also had an in depth discussion with one of
Paxton Supercharger's engineers, and he stated that a Paxton supercharger
should be good for 475HP on the 928. He hasn't personally done any 928s,
but they regularly put the Paxton on the Camaro, which starts with a 300HP
5.7L V8 (similar motor), and it apparently does 450HP easy. The only thing
he mentioned was that he wasn't sure if it would fit in the cramped engine
bay, and that I would have to get custom brackets machined (no biggie).
I would like to point out it's inherent advantages:
 - No permanent mods to engine, as with 6L kit from Devek.
 - Bolt on design works with stock motor
 - Uses less fuel of boost than 6L motor
 - No Turbo Lag - Paxton claims instantaneous response (optomistic)
 - More horsepower than 6L kit
 - Uses low boost on stock motor, can be set higher when combined with
other engine     mods.
 - Requires no intercooler, runs very cool
 - Cost for the supercharger is only $2500.00 !

Granted there would be some work to shoehorn the unit into the engine bay,
but I think the results would be worth it. I think you would gain the same
effect as the 6L kit, for less.It wouldn't be enough to get to 200MPH, but
I wouldn't have very far to go. I still would have to get brake and
suspension mods. No, I don't work for Paxton, but I think they've got a
good product that a lot of us overlook in our quest for speed.

Let me know what you guys think.
