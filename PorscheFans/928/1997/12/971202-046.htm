Sounds good for the Portfolio.  I'll be looking forward to receiving 
it from Devek.

The Porsche 928GTS book is about 5-6" tall, about 1/4" thick, and 
about 9" wide.  For about $15 it has several pages of full page 
pictures of the GTS and a few of the earlier models, several cut-away 
drawings of the engines/transmissions and quite a few tables showing 
the different available car designations and their information such 
as size, power, engine type, etc.  It was well worth the money for 
the book.  It is part of a series that has the 911, the Testarossa 
(512), the 348, and several other cars.  I have the 911, 928, 512, 
and 348 ones, BTW.  I bought mine through Classic Motorbooks out of 
WI here in the US of A.

If you want any more specific information, please let me know and 
I'll be happy to provide it.
