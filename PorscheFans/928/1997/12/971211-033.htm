Philip Hi!

Yes it JUST so happens that the banks are throwing money around at the moment...
and the prices are such that I thought I COULD afford the one I wanted NOW NOW NOW!!
Having spoken to a few ppl in the club etc etc..I found that I DIDNT need to buy an "unleaded" version
ie: 32 valve!
So I went for the LAST of the 16valvers!! (good descision!) after looking at about 12 of them and test
driving about 6 I finally decided on this one!! (and the fact that Ian Hamilton ..Porsche guru said quote...
"if you can get it ..GRAB IT!") So..I did! hehe

It cost me A$34,000 plus around $1,600 in repairs to get it up to a standard that I'm happy with! (for now!)
These lucky "septics" who pick up these "art forms" for below 20K dont KNOW how GOOD they get it! :^)
Or..maybe they DO!! <grin>

I also discovered that my Insurance company is doing DEALS with "Quicktrack" the tracking carwatch alarm
ppl ..its SUCH a good deal that I'm getting it fitted within the week!! (as opposed to next year!) YES!!

I'll look forward to having a beer with you ..and showing off  "BABY"  ANYTIME!

Kind regards,

Leonard  Zech
