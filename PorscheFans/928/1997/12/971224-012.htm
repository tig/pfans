You might actually find that very high octane gas (104 through 114
octane is what I've used in the past) causes your engine to run poorly.
This has been a topic of much discussion on the motorcycle race list,
and I know several people whose street bikes ran like crap on 100+
octane fuel...although mine have always loved it.

I believe that higher octane merely gives you a bigger safety margin
against detonation (assuming everything else stays the same).  This
allows you to tune your engine closer to that terrifying, expensively
catastrophic edge.

When I've run street bikes on race gas, they've generally run better,
stronger, etc., but I suspect it's more to do with other properties of
the race gas other than octane.
