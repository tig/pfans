OK, I couldn't stand it, so I went through the shop manual and some other
references and found some more answers. The 928 manual, at page 90-27
(dated June 1982), describes diagnostic procedures for (ta-daah!) the fuel
consumption indicator, which is fed by a "sensor signal (duration of
injection)". This is described as a square-wave signal changing frequency
with engine speed.

Understanding that the "square" wave is actually a train of variable-length
pulses, this description fits an intermittent-injection system like the
L-Jetronic, in which the injectors open for a controlled time each engine
cycle. The average value (duty factor) of this signal does a good job of
indicating fuel flow (e.g., liters/hr).

This page of the manual also shows that the fuel consumption indicator
looks at the speedometer signal (also a pulse train), which carries the
road speed info (e.g., km/hr) needed to permit the f.c.i. to do the
division and calculate fuel consumption (e.g., liters/100 km).

So, if everything is working, this indicator actually does what it's
supposed to, within the accuracy limits set by the source signals and
whatever electronic or electromechanical trick is used inside the gauge to
divide the two values.

If you haven't yet fallen asleep, check out page 90-53 (dated August 1984)
and its description of the upshift indicator (another parasite on the
tachometer), which is explicitly described as using the speedometer signal
and the injection time signal from the L-Jetronic control unit.
