Was browsing DuPont's web site and found a button for emailing 
questions to real humans. So I asked a question:

Was pretty sure this stuff had been around a long time.

I have a  new  part time job at a small but busy independent porsche repair
facility and have worked on several 944 with 4 valves per cylinder. these
heads look very similar to 85 and on 32 v 928 heads.  It seem that it is a
some what common problem that the tesioner that adjusts the chain tension for
the 2 cams has a rubbing block that wears and breaks causing major damage when
the chain jumps or breaks and bends valves.

finally the question:  does an 86 928s have a similar tesioning system with
the rubbing block that wears and breaks, I have an 86 928s I just bought with
75k miles on it and am concerned that a cheap piece of plastic may ruin my
day.

Thanks
Glenn

I am getting ready to have my intake runners, plenums and valve covers
painted, I have a question on the color (86 928 usa).  On my car these parts
are not silver in color, they are more of a bronze , gold, dirty silver color.
Is this the color, or was it silver and changed color from the heat oil etc?
thanks
