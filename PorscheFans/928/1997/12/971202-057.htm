     I recently posted to the list about a 1981 928 for $5995.  I was told
over the phone a couple of weeks ago that the automatic transmission was
starting to go out.  
     I went to look at the car today, and it seems to be in decent shape.
 The engine runs good with no misses, and it idles at around 900-950 RPM.
 There was a very small amount of steam when the car was initially started,
but it disappeared in a few minutes.  I suspect it was just condensation in
the tailpipe.  
     I didn't drive the car today because it was in the evening and I want to
drive it in the daylight to look for loose items, smoke, and leaks.  I did
run the shifter through the gears and they all engaged well.  The salesman
didn't mention anything about the transmission this time (HMMMM!).  Anyway, I
thought that I would check the transmission fluid, so I went to the engine
compartment to find the dipstick.  I couldn't find it in the engine
compartment, then I remembered that the transmission is in the rear (DUH!).
 So, just how do you check the transmission fluid, anyway?
     Where is the battery?  It''s by the rear axle, right?  I didn't see it
when I was looking back there, but then I didn't crawl underneath.  I'll do
that after I drive it.  By the way, how do you guys get jumpstarts?
     The car has 150,000 miles, and seems to be in good overall shape.  It
has a few paint chips and small cracks in the Driver's side leather, but it
is a 1981, so I guess I should expect that.  It appears to have the
Competition group with front and rear spoilers and no body rub trim (could
have been done by the PO).  Two things that really bothered me were the
Passenger's side window and the Sunroof didn't work.  This might have been my
fault, the switches weren't marked, so I'm not sure if they were the right
switches.  Do I have the orientation right with the switches?  Center
console, from Driver's side to Passenger there are 4 switches: Driver's
window, Passenger's window or sunroof, rear wiper, Passenger's window or
sunroof.
     Any things in particular that I should check when I drive the car this
weekend?  The Salesman said that he would have their mechanics check out the
window and sunroof to see why they're not working as well as give it a more
thorough going over to list the other problems they might find.  Of course,
they probably won't be looking too hard;)  Thanks In Advance.
