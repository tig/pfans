Michael - My car did that a few times a couple of years ago. I knew
that the battery was weak - it would start to slow after about ten
seconds of cranking - so I replaced it, and the problem instantly
vanished. There is a voltage threshold somewhere that's quite sharp.
Probably in the injection control unit, but that's just a guess.

The other thing is: did you check the fuel rail pressure when the
thing was refusing to start? Or at least verify that the pressure
stays high after the engine is turned off? Vaporlock due to the
combination of heat and reduced pressure is a frequent cause
of your symptoms.
