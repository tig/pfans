The slave cylinder is pretty inexpensive and the cost of a rebuilt might
be almost the same.  So if you really want to carry a spare, might as
well
buy a new one or just carry a rebuild kit (if they make it).

As for bleeding the brake, the clutch cylinder only disable half of your 
braking system.  The reservoir is built so that either the front or rear
brakes
will remain operational in case of a leak.  If your reservoir never got
empty,
bleeding should not be necessary.  HOWEVER, bleeding is easy and running
out
of brake is not funny (or even dangerous).  I would bleed my brakes just
in
case.

The biggest problem with bleeding the clutch is the proper way to do
it.  It
cannot be done like the brake system as the pedal will not come back up
on 
its own.  I think the best way is with a pressure bleeding system or the
old vacuum pump.  If someone has a better way, please let me know.
