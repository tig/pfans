E.J.

Your post immediately made me think of Alfred Vanderbilt's reply to =
someone who asked him how much it cost to operate his huge yacht,=20
"If you have to ask, you couldn't afford it".  However, its' difficult =
to come up with an average.  I'm on my seventh 928, and have driven them =
roughly 350 thousand miles since my first one in 77.   Some I spent next =
to nothing on, and a couple of them were sort of like Vanderbilt's =
yacht.  Much depends on the type of driving, mileage, and climate.  As =
far as tuneup costs go, when my present car, an 87S4 5speed, approached =
the 60K mark, the local Porsche dealer told me in a very cavalier =
manner, that the 60K tuneup would run "somewhere between 12 and 15 =
hundred dollars.  Instead, I had the local mechanic I used at the time =
do it.  He charged $523.00 and apologized profusely for the big bill =
which was largely labor.=20

I feel that if you can find an individual who is really experienced with =
928s and who isn't into raping you because you drive an expensive car, =
that you're usually better off than taking it to a Porsche dealer.  I'm =
sure some of the members will disagree with that, and I realize that =
there may be special circumstances where a dealer might be equipped to =
perform some services not normally available from an individual =
mechanic, but in all my years of driving the breed I haven't found many =
of them.

While I goofed on my "200 hundred..." comment, in spirit it was pretty
accurate.  The farther you drive a 928 the more you love it!  My original
intention was that my 928 would not be a daily driver, but it's so much fun!
Don't tell my insurance company, I get a deep discount as it is listed as an
occasional ride.

Merry Christmas to all!
