I have installed a rebuilt torque tube in my car, from 928 international, I
now have a strange whining noise throught the console that I didn't have
before.  I have not mentioned it to the guy's at 928 International, I'm sure
they would make good,as they are the best source for 928 parts.  The problem
is the labor,  I don't want to have to spend a full day ripping the trans
out just to replace the tube.....

On the subject of stolen cars.  Thiefs steal the easiest targets.  I say
make them work for it!  The harder it is for them to get the car, the longer
it takes, the better chance ther is of them getting caught.  I personally
have tried to remove a club by sawing the steering wheel.  It is easy enough
to do, but if the club is on tight it takes some work to get it off.
Combine that with the factory alarm, and the  alarm I have added, my shark
is no easy target.  There is also a auto taser that you can install with
your factory arlarm that will disable the thief just like a normal taser!
It cost about $200.  if you want to keep your car, then work at it.  Owning
a 928 is not just the fun part of driving it......You have to protect it as
well.  Oh, I also moved the factory alarm module to a very obscure place
just in case the thief specializes in 928's! :o)
