Last Saturday, as I was re-packing by Beastie for the winter (I
unpacked it for the Thanksgiving Day trek - and what a trek it was :)
!! ) as I removed the battery I noticed the tell-tail yellow/white
powder-like spoor at the bottom of the battery box.  I coated the
bottom of the box in a bit of baking soda and sprayed some water over
it and carefully rinsed with clean water.  Most of the water and
salt-goo drained onto the ground through the box's weep holes.  Then I
thoroughly dried the box.  When I was done it was as good as new - no
rust, no acid salts.

Total cost - about $0.50. Did I do a bad thing?  I think I'd rather do
this once or twice a year rather then leave a mat in the box.
