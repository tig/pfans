Dear fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

Yesterday my 86 was assaulted by a run away Honda Civic. Fortunately, there
was only minor damage and the offender was charge by the local constabulary.
Repairs will begin soon after the holidays. If you live in the Metro
Washington, DC area, you may already know the best places for body work. I
have a few in mind, but I am always on the look-out for others.

When it comes to batteries, my advice is get the biggest and best that you
can afford. Also, DO NOT EVER get/use a freedom or no-maintenance battery
for your Porsche (any Porsche). You know, the type with the glowing "green"
light on one of the cells. All that light tells you is; "That particular
cell is charged". One or more of the other five could be deffective or dead
and it will still glow. I use the top-of-the-line Interstate battery and
have only had two bulbs and one relay fail in the nearly 8 years I've owned
the 928S. My lack of electrical problems is partly or entirely due to the
use of a quality battery.

My general advice to all of you is; Don't repair or replace parts on a 928
with less than the quality it originally came with. Use OEM or better and
your 928 will reward you with multiple care-free high performance miles of
smiles.

Happy motoring and holidays. Ed
