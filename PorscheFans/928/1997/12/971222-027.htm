>>I'm running Penzoil in my '83 S.

If you *have* to run a petroleum oil, Kendall is one of the better ones.
But I wouldn't recommend using any petroleum in anything but junker
cars.

>>The local 928 shop recommends it.

In order to know a good oil from a bad one, you need to subject two
engines
to identical conditions for a period of time, measure things like dyno
HP,
temperatures, etc., then do a tear-down and measure wear on parts.

Most shops don't do this sort of testing, which means they're repeating
to
you what they've heard elsewhere.  Unfortunately, information passed
down
tends to be distorted...and if it starts its life at the marketing dept
of the oil
company, well....

Who DOES this sort of testing?

The oil manufacturers.  Can you trust them?  Probably not--you can
design
tests and manipulate stats to prove almost anything.

Auto manufacturers.  Can you trust them to be fair to the oil companies?
Maybe...but usually they won't release finding for legal reasons.  If
you're
interested in Red Line vs. Mobil 1, you can get a copy of an extensive
test
done by GM Delco Chassis division (racing Olds Quad 4 engines and 
transmission) from Red Line 1-800-624-7958.

High-dollar race teams and engine builders.  Can you trust them?  Only
if they're not sponsored!
If you're interested, call Red Line for race team testimonials...and ask
them to tell you which
teams are sponsored and which are not.  Check out Jim Jones' (the owner
of
Traco Engineering) story--he builds 350 V-8 motors for Corvette
endurance racing, and his engines 
are run by different teams using different oils, many of them other
synthetics. He will get engines 
back from the different teams after a 24-hour race. All engines ran at
the same track and have the
same number of miles, but he can always tell the Red Line engines from
the others. The difference in 
wear is incredible. The most noticeable difference is in the valve
guides. After 24-hours operation on 
other synthetics they are completely worn, while with Red Line they are
still in good condition. 

I think this is a meaningful comparison, since this guy doesn't choose
the oil each engine is run
on, and isn't sponsored...and the engines are identical and subjected to
the exact same conditions.
