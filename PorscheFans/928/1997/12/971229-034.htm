Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

Actually, it's "Phosphate" that is the ingredient to avoid. Perhaps
silicates do not help either, but phasphate will eventually eat the water
pumps and other moving ports in the cooling sysytem on aluminum engines.

On the subject of Chroming Alloys, as I've been told by several
metalurgists, the wheels need to be both etched and heated for the chrome to
adhere. Both have a weaking effect on Alloys. If the wheels were steel, they
could take the process with little or no harmful effects. Alloys are usually
built to be light-weight yet strong. If one removes some of the material one
runs the risk of weakening the wheel below TUV standards. For day-to-day
driving there will likely be no problem. However, when these wheels are
subjected to the forces usually encountered at a track event, one could
exceed the strength of the potentially weaked chrome wheel.

It is interesting to note that all of the major German Auto manufacturers
specifically mention that their OEM alloy wheels should not be chromed. To
do so voids the warranty. I think they know more about their products than
the vast majority of us. I do not intend to second guess Porsche AG as to
why they do not recommend chroming. As I said before, it's your wheels,
money, and life. The wheels and money can be replaced.

Happy motoring and new year. Ed
