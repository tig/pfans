Hey all,
I will be getting the diamond blue/maroon 1987 928S4 auto that I sold a
couple of months ago back in stock.  Anyone interested?  It is a
beautiful car and is in excellent shape.  E-mail me back or give me a
call.

There was a recent post about the color names and codes "indischrot" and this
triggered a question that had been percolating in my brain. I just got a 1987
S4 and the color on the door was cherryrot. This sounded close enough to
cherry red to be reasonable, but there was a nagging thought that cherry in
German was "kirsch". When I called PCNA to check on the car's history, they
told me the color was Rubystone Red! I wondered if others had a simiar
experience and if there was a list to decode german to english colors. What is
Guards red in german? My 84 is schieferblaumetallic, I think that translates
to marine blue metallic, but I have not yet called PCNA to verify. Feedback on
other colors might be interesting.

Hello everyone and happy new year,
  I was wondering what the best way to cut through sheet metal was?  Also, I
have looked at the S4 update packages and they all seem to be fiberglass. How
strong are the bumpers? Would it be better to do it by getting used bumpers
from S4's that are bieng parted out and how much harder is it to put the
original s4 bumpers on? Just wondering and thanks,
matt
