Alex - I never hear my fuel pump (of course, my hearing ain't
what it useta be). Always wondered about people who mention that
they can hear theirs all the time; it seems unlikely to me that
Porsche designed it that way.

As to batteries running down: the newer the car, the more little
odds and ends it has drawing current out of the battery even with
everything shut off and the doors closed. Radio, alarm, clock,
engine control units, cell phones,... My '84 draws just about
13 milliamps with everything off, and the battery has never
run down, even after sitting for a couple of months. One other
thing is that the early cars had a somewhat less powerful
alternator, so it may not have been sufficient to keep the
battery charged under worst-case conditions (lots of short trips in 
traffic with the headlights on and the stereo blasting, for
instance).
