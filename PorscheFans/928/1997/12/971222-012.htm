Here's some general info on oil and oil changes--I've become a bit of an
oil expert, having spent a lot of time researching synthetics....

(I'm not a chemical engineer, I just play one on this list)

Petroleum:  dino juice is pretty useless after 3000-4000 miles.
Materials
"cook" out of it, evaporating and depositing on surfaces.  Friction goes
way
up pretty quickly...and it starts off fresh MUCH worse than any
synthetic.

Synthetic:  varies by mfg'er, since radically different base stocks are
used
for different oils.  Under moderate loads, you'll find an oil like Mobil
1 15W50
producing about 35% more wear after 5000 miles...under heavy loads, 
this climbs to more like 60% at 5K miles.  Wider-range synthetics will
increase in wear more dramatically.  If you spend the money for Red
Line,
the increase is not measurable at 15,000 miles under moderate loads, but
under heavy loads, the wear will increase to nearly 25% after 15,000
miles.
To put this into perspective, it's useful to note that the Mobil 1 15W50
after
5000 miles is still vastly superior to fresh petroleum 20W50.

Red Line's recommendations:  drain the oil between 12,000 and 15,000
miles,
but stick to your normal filter change intervals (5,000 to 7,000 miles).

Synthetics resist breakdown due to temperature and shear forces much 
better than petroleum oils, and tend not to "cook" off and leave
deposits 
(Castrol Syntec is an exception).  However, you need to continue to
change
your FILTER at the normal intervals for three reasons:  (1) filter
durability,
(2) particles in your oil that are small enough to pass through the
filter, 
and (3) chemical contaminants in your oil (blow-by, etc.) which the
filter
can't filter out.
