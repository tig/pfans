>'88 928 SE (original condition)

	Who cares about how rare it is! No car has ever been, or will ever be a
decent investment. If you want to modify something on the car, just make
sure it's reversible. I've heard to much crap from Porschephiles about
"original concours condition" and I think it is ludicrous. If you want to
leave it stock, do so. If you want your car to be what you want it to be,
and not what Stuttgart wanted it to be, then all the power to you. You must
realize that every production car is a compromise. Porsche must compromise
to create a car that all of its buyers will like. Not everyone wants a rock
hard suspension, 1.0G of braking, or 500HP. Remember that most people
purchased our sharks as a grand tourer. That was its intended role.

Besides, after my S4 is finished, complete with body mods on the rear,
motor upgrades, etc., it will be a one of a kind. If would argue that if
there is only one of my car in the world, that makes it quite a bit rarer
than the SE, doesn't it?

Don't sell it Philip. Do whatever the hell you want with it. It's your car,
your business. I applaud you for even wanting to modify it in the first place.

'87 S4 Definitely Not Stock
