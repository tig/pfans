Perhaps that's how it happened, but quite frankly if it were tightened that
much,
it would much more likely strip the threads than break the spark plug.    Maybe
a combination of corrosion and vibration . . . who knows.


However, as most of you

I would tell my customer to first get ready for a fairly high labor bill,
because 
there will be NO guarantee that it will all come out.   I think I would try
to cut another
spark plug in half  at the point where this one broke just to see what I had
to work
with.   Then remove the valve cover, and see what the access is like.    If
you have
been able to figure out the right tool, then be careful, get firm purchase
on the
stub and hope for the best . . . after lots of penetrating oil.    

If you get it out, see if all the pieces are present.    If not, time to
remove the head.
Costly?   Sadly yes.    

If you can't get it out, see above.   Head removal.    

Hope you get lucky.

Dave
