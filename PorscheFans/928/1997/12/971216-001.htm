Ever since I've had my car (a whopping 10 weeks now!) I've had trouble 
making my passenger seat move forward.  This weekend, the disk on the 
switch broke off completely!  I'm assuming it was a bad switch all along, 
and it obviously needs replacing at this point anyway.

I suppose I need to replace the whole switch unit, right?  Anyone know 
ballpark pricing for a new one and how easy it is to install?  I'm not the 
world's best mechanic, but I can handle a screwdriver.  While I've got the 
switch out, is there anything else I should check to make sure the seat 
will work properly when I get the new switch in?

Thanks in advance,

Bill
