Dear Mark and the rest of the "Land Shark" tamers:

Several years ago, there was an article in Excellence (Oct.92 ?) on the
subject. The author, (sorry, but I do not have the article or the name)
trailered a small travel trailer with his 82 or 83 928. Ther trailer was
less than 5K lbs. but much more than 1K lbs. Seems the 928 had no problem
towing that trailer.

I occasionally tow a small utility trailer that weighs less than 1K lbs. No
special hitch is required and no extra holes were drilled into the OEM
bumper either. It was on my car at the "Frenzy".

On a different note, I still have some "928 Frenzy" polo shirts in stock.
The main color is  "ash" with black collar and cuffs. The button down slit
is teal as is the 928S on the left breast with the left side of the car in
profile. The words "928 Frenzy" are above the car. An oval with "shark
teeth" at the top and bottom borders the entire logo. In all, the logo is
3.5" in length and about 2.5" in height. The quality of the shirt is
compareable to "Outer Banks". $35 for Medium or Large, $37 for eXtra-Large
or eXtra-eXtra-large, including delivery. 

Send me an E-mail for an address to send the checks. All proceeds go to "PCA
Potomac Region". My e-mail address is: eds928s@erols.com

Happy motoring and holidays. Ed

I guess I'll throw in my few cents worth about supercharging...

The intercooler's function is to reduce the temperature of the pressurized air
to prevent the fuel-air mixture from detonating in the cylinder after it is
compressed by the piston, which further raises its temperature.  It is
important to stay away from the mixture's auto-ignition point.  Just because
the temperature of the compressed air coming out of the supercharger is higher
than that of the incoming air does not mean it is less dense.  Pressure is
also higher, resulting in a smaller volume.  If it wasn't for the problem of
auto-ignition, the higher temperature compressed air would be beneficial since
it is extra energy which is released to the piston.  Intercooling the
compressed air releases this energy to the outside air stream thereby wasting
the work put into the air by the compressor.   Intercooling will allow you to
increase boost to cram more air into the cylinder (which unfortunately also
raises the effective compression ratio) by offsetting the temperature increase
due to the effective compression increase.  As pointed out, reducing the
engine's static compression ratio will also reduce the effective compression
ratio, helping to offset the hotter pressurized air.

I'm pretty sure that truck engines use turbochargers (you always hear that
characteristic turbo whine when they go by, or vice-versa).  Diesels do best
over relatively narrow rpm ranges (hence the use of many gears), consequently
turbos can be optimized for a small rpm range of operation, which reduces lag.
Positive displacement types, on the other hand, work over a wide rpm range
(10:1 is not uncommon).  They have a very linear flow vs. rpm characteristic
(which of course the engine itself also has...more or less) which makes them
ideal for providing the same power delivery characteristics as a big-inch
motor.  As far as I'm concerned, a positive-displacement supercharger is the
way to go if you want the power delivery characteristics of a normally
aspirated engine....nice linear power with no big spikes at WOT.

My opinions, not those of management.
(these controversies are quite interesting...they make you think about lots of
things, burn up lots of brain cells)

BTW, no way can you make an electric CONTINUOUS supercharger.  Like LL said,
you'd need quite a bit of HP to drive it.  You'd have to have at least a 15 HP
motor, and even then it really wouldn't be enough.  You're talking about 1000
amps at 12v volts!  For DC motors this big, it is typical to use 270volts to
keep the current at a reasonable level (like 30-40 amps).  I'm more than a
little sceptical.  This would have to be magic.
