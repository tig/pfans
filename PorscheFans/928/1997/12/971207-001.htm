Has anyone gone through the modification to re-valve the automatic
transmission to always start in first, as opposed to second gear? If so,
what were your experiences with this modification? Was it easy to do?
Costly? How do you like the change? My trans is coming out of my car, so
I thought it might be a good time to do it, if it's not too much
trouble. Thanks for any feedback.

Mike,

You might want to try 3M's Imperial Hand Glaze, part no. 051131-05990. I
bought it at our local auto paing supply house. It was recommened to me by
John Paterik, the PCA restoration guru.
I originally needed it to remove the haze from the back plastic window of a
911 Cab I once owned and it worked great. Later, I tried it on the instrument
panel lens of a 944 Turbo S I had and that too worked very well.

Good Luck,

John Weber

can some one explane Why the weight of my 1988 928 automatic is 3398 on the
title when the factor specs say 3549?

to any one with a custom chip from autosport design :
what kind of performance can I expect on a 1988 928 s4 automatic with Devek
racing exhaust and headers , and K&N filter?
how long does the programing take ?
