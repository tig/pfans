With a heavy heart I offer our beloved 86 928S for sale at $10,500 to
support my son's entry into Formula Atlantic.  It is white/tan, 5-sp,
serial number 407, with new bilsteins, water pump, and timing belt in
the past 4k miles, 82K miles, never bent, good records.  This is a
southern California/Arizona car with no rust, scratches, dents, or
dinged wheels. The dash has a couple of minor cracks, but other than
that, it is in very good condition.  Please call if you want to
discuss.  Thanks. Stan, (520) 886-9559, Tucson, AZ

Leonard,

Unless I'm really dense (no pun intended), does not your reply agree with the
following statement I made in my last post?

>Just because the temperature of the compressed air coming out of the
supercharger is higher than that of the incoming air does not mean it is
less dense.<

>>Sorry, this is not correct. There is not a fixed relationship between
pressure and density. Imagine a sealed container with room air inside and a
pressure gauge mounted. Put the container on the stove so the air inside
gets hot. As the temperature rises, the pressure will too, due to the
higher average velocity of the gas molecules. The amount of air inside the
container hasn't changed, nor has the container's volume (at least not very
much), so the density of the air (mass per unit volume) is unchanged.<<

A second item I still believe is correct.....

Energy gained by the ambient incoming air due to work applied by the
compressor, whether in the form of pressure or temperature, is energy that can
be used to drive the piston.  Obviously this is only a very minor contributor
in comparison with the energy provided by the fuel, but nevertheless it is a
contributor.  One of the initiatives to improve internal combustion engine
efficiency (piston and turbine) is to retain as much heat as possible inside
the cylinder; heat loss is just wasted fuel.  A lot of work is being done to
coat the cylinders and pistons with ceramic to retain heat.  Similarly,
intercooling dissipates some of the energy gained in the compression process
through temperature reduction, so it is not a good thing in and of
itself...but it is necessary if higher charging flows are desired in order to
keep the mixture below the autoignition point.  The density of the charge will
not increase by cooling the compressor's output, it is unaffected in the sense
that the amount of mass flow entering the cylinder will not be increased.
Certainly cooling the air entering the compressor is beneficial, but once it
enters the closed system defined by the outlet of the compressor, the
associated plumbing to the engine, and the fixed volume of the cylinder,
density, or rather mass flow, will be unaffected by the intercooling process.

Another thought to explain this, as I see it, is that if the intercooler's
purpose was to increase charge density, hence mass flow to the cylinder, you
could achieve the same effect by setting the waste gate to a higher blow off
pressure, or use a larger compressor if necessary, rather than go through the
trouble of plumbing in an intercooler.  I therefore stick to my contention
that the intercooler has the sole purpose of reducing intake charge
temperature to avoid autoignition.  If you add an intercooler and do not
increase supercharger output pressure, there will be no power increase since
the density of the charge to the cylinders will be unchanged.

Oh well, I'm sure we can discuss this topic some more....and maybe come to
some agreement??
