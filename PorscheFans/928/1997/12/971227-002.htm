I've read a few messages lately about the integrity of the 928 in the
event of the front-end collision. Well, in 1995 this happened to me.  I
collided with a Karmen Ghia (college student in opposing lane made a
left turn in front of me in a very wide interection. Posted speed along
boulevard was 50 mph). I was accelerating through 2nd gear approaching
the intersection that just turned green for me, going about 30-35, and
he decided to run his "late" yellow. Police figured he was going through
the turn about 25 mph.  It happened so fast, all I could do was stab
right to avoid a head-on.  He hit me just in front of the left tire. I
recall watching the Karmen spin 2 times as he bounced off me.  I had
braced myself with the steering wheel, stood on the brakes and the
Porsche stopped without losing control after skidding in a perfect arc. 
I had the presence of mind to keep my clutch in.  I turned the motor
off, unbuckled the seat belt and had absolutely no injuries -- not even
a bruise from the belt.  I was a bit sore later but no cuts, broken
bones, etc.  The Karmen driver had to be extricated from his car and was
taken away on a stretcher.  Now the damage report: The lower left a-arm
was cracked in half, the front-end, hood, cowling totaled.  The lower
frame rail was bent under the shock tower, upper a-arm broken at the
ball joint, radiator and all front-end stuff was mush.  The motor on the
other hand ran ok, and did not suffer any apparent damage. Also, the
left front wheel did not break or crack.  So, here is an actual account
of how phreaking strong these cars are.  The 928, in my estimation, is
the best engineered high-speed GT car in the world.

Here is a story I don;t get a chance to tell much these days. In the
early seventies, I had an occasion to take part in a slalom at the
Porsche test and development center at Weissach, West Germany. At the
time I was living in Germany, and drove a 356 S90 (and pursuing plans to
race formula cars). The "prize" for winning your class was the privilage
of being a passenger for 4 hot laps in a 917 short tail.  I did, and it
was incredible. Other cars available for hot laps included a turbo 911
driven by Jurgen Barth...also on hand to give us Porsche driving tips. 
On the circular skid-pad parking area was an odd looking contraption (so
I thought).  It didn't have any front fenders and was powered by a
water-cooled V8.  At the time, I thought it was really ugly.  It was
heavily fitted with measuring insturments. I was told it was a protoytpe
design under development....have you guessed what it was ? Yes, an early
928 prototype.  Little did I know, one would save me from serious injury
some twenty-years later.

John and Phil asked:  Are fans supposed to operate with the key in the off
position?

The fans only work when the key is ON (ACC or IGN position).  There is no
voltage to the fan control unit with the key in the OFF position, hence no
fans.

They are operating normally.
