Steinar, for what it's worth, my experience in trying to find parts in
Germany for my Euro model was not good.  I was looking for an early Euro
S motor, very rare over here.  

In the US, there are many dismantlers of wrecked cars, sadly 928's
included.  Used parts are therefore available at reasonable prices.

In Germany, I'm told that wrecked cars are quickly shipped to the former
east bloc countries, that no network of parts salvagers exists.  As an
option, I was told that Holland has a few dismantlers.  Maybe you'll get
some responses from our Dutch list subscribers.

In England, I have contacted two dismantlers (see below).  Got their
names through the Porsche Club in GB.  Give them a try?  The shipping
would certainly be cheaper than getting parts from the US.

Good luck!  Let the list know how you make out.
