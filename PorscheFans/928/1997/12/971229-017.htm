Re: The thread on tires -

There have been several comments about noise from the Dunlop tires.

My '86S 5-speed has Dunlop D40-M2 tires, and I get no detectable tire
noise. The car is very quiet overall - interesting, non?

I have been happy with both wet and dry traction, ride quality, etc. Of
course, I might mention that I have no real basis of comparison, as
these are the only tires that I have used on the 928. BTW, my Jaguar XJS
has Michelin Sport EPS tires, and the wet traction is totally
unacceptable. The car will spin both rear tires (limited slip) starting
in second gear. The Dunlops are much better. 

Since I believe that we all are much more likely to reach traction
limits in wet conditions than dry, I consider wet traction to be more
important. My 928 is a daily driver, though. It is snowing heavily as I
write (very unusual in the Atlanta area!), so I may go see how the
Dunlops are in the white.
