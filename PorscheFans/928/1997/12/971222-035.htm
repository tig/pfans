Yahoo!!!!  
Just bought an 86 928S and drove it 1000 miles home.  Tried to be good
all the way back, but it's a real kick in the rear when floored at 70.
Engine feels strong, exhaust is clean.  Just had the emissions checked
for licensing and it was almost perfect.  Handling is tight and sure.
Slight vibration at 40 and 75, this will be checked tomorrow.  I think a
slipped belt in one of the tires, hoping for just balancing.  I checked
the half shafts and there is no wobble.

Thanks for all of the commentary on the 928.  Several people provided
individual help and this list provides motivation where the spark is
alive.

This weekend planning to replace front brake pads, ATF fluid and
Coolant.  1. Brakes should be no problem, 
 2. ATF - Any hints, tricks.  What is the Torque for the pan bolts? 
Without knowing I will check torque by adjusting and tightening bolts
with my torque wrench.
 3. Coolant - Owners manual says to check and fill to the seam when
cold. Manual says to replace O-rings, is this necessary?  Can I get them
from any parts store or are they special Porsche parts. 

Thanks 
Ken

'86 928S auto  for fun!
