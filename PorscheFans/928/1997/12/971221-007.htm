Thilo,

Your remark concerning oil consumption at an indicated 180 mph makes perfect
sense.  also, the blue smoke your friends noticed can easily be explained.
An 87S4 with automatic transmission can reach 180mph approximately three
seconds after if falls out of a C-130.  The blue smoke your friends noticed
was not coming from your car.  It was seeping up through cracks in the
autobahn from a place far below.  If you heard any other sound over the
anguished scream of the engine, it may have been Gabriel blowing his horn.

Cruising at or below 150mph will dramatically decrease both oil consumption
and tire wear. Now that you've identified yourself as an attorney, I'll
reiterate my earlier remarks about playing on the freeway.  Perhaps you
should add some teflon coated rosary beads to your mirror.  They may come in
handy.

Gene O'Rourke

>way, or you get good access to the bolt heads.   Loosen both bolts - but
>no need to remove them - on the side to be adjusted.
>4.    You have options at this point:   You can grasp the rod by hand
>and carefully maneuver the pod so it rotates "more open" while holding

>pod rod and clinch.
>5.    Temporarily tighten the clinch bolts and test positions by

>There are a couple of 'stops' in the headlight mechanism that you can

>
>Hi, all
>I currently have a 1990 S4 with the originial Reno2 cassette player. I've
seen
>that the CD-2 CD player was an option that year. I was going to get the
>current Blaupunkt CD player, but the saleman said it has its own amp and
would
>bypass the amp that the Reno2 uses. It is outboard of the passenger seat,
>under the carpeted cover.
>I want to have my cake and eat it too. I want both CD and cassette.
>Unfortunately, I can't have the cassette player/CD controller unit with the
CD
>changer mounted somewhere in back.
>So, I was wondering if anyone knows if the CD2 requires the external amp.
And
>also if someone has one to sell.

>David - my '91GT using 15-50 Mobile I (21,500 mi)does not discernably burn
any oil at 1000 - 1200 mi. But two things...

"tender" on the engine. I'm sure consumption would increase if the engine
