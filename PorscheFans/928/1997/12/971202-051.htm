Re: Trying to reset the radio after the battery has run down, or been
disconnected.
I'm sure there are more knowledgable people on line  on this subject,
but I'll give you my input.

One of the "features" of this radio is that the code is to keep people
from stealing the radio and using it. The code keeps every thing shut
down until it reset.

Details on how to do this is in the Bleaupunkt (spelling) manual. If you
don't have one, I think you can get one from the state side rep. If not
e-mail me and Ill fax you the insructions from my cheat sheet.

Any way, yes you need to leave it powered up for some time. I think 4
hours is a minimum. When "code" comes on the display, use the preset
radio buttons to enter the 'code'. The buttons are numbered 1 to 6.
The code is entered starting with button one for the first digit of the
code, the second for the second digit, etc..

If the code is 5306, press button "1" 5 times, go to button "2" and
press it 3 times, go to button "3" DO NOT PRESS THIS BUTTON because it's
A '0' and no input = zero, then go to button "4" and press it 6 times.
Now you have entered the code 5306, and if it feels like it, it just
might come on and play for you. If it doesn't try it again and pay close
attention to how many times you press each button to be sure you put in
the correct code number for that position. You only get three chances as
I remember, and if you fail, you need to unhook the battery for a while
then reconnect it again, and wait for "code" to come up on the display
again. I'm all thumbs and I finally got mine to work.

'90 s4 and toooo many others, yes, I just bought another today for my
daughter. I had 5, and now it's 6. Does anyone ever get away from their
kids!
