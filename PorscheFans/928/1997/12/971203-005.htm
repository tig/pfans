Well, no worries at the moment, since Andy is still around and I don't get
his 928.  He probably used a water gun at dawn instead.  I guess I would
have done the same thing :-)

And my monetary situation won't even allow a visit to your side of the
world at the moment.  Although it would be nice as its getting right chilly
around here now.

Oh, BTW my brother's name is Philip, so I'd be right at home down there
with all of the Andrew's, Andy's, and a Philip.
