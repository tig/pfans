Mark Sherman:
    Reference your request for info on the various flavors of 928,etc..
There was an article about mid summer in Panorama, the Porsche Club
magazine on buying a used 928, which I thought gave the most practical
advice I have seen on all of the nuances of models and options and the
like as well as the pitfalls to avoid. Find a member of PCNA and I'm
sure that they will have that issue.That will enable you to refine your
search and you can then come to this list for specific details about
your proposed selection. Good Luck!

Anthony Bodin mentioned that his boot motor was working, but not releasing the
hatch.

In my case, had a similar situation.  The right rear corner of the hatch was
closer to the bumper cover than the left rear corner (and would sometimes
strike it if hatch was closed too vigorously).  No problem, just extend the
little rubber bumper at the right corner (turn CCW) to gain a little more
clearance between hatch and cover when closed.

Now, although the hatch appeared to close and latch properly (couldn't open it
manually), the motor would not always successfully release the hatch when
activated.  It seems that the latching mechanism was not fully reset when the
hatch was closed.  Any way, turned the hatch adjuster CW until the hatch would
release reliably.

Could you have the same problem?

Merry Christmas to All.

Hi All,

A few weeks ago I responded to someone's question concerning where to get a
928 aligned in the Portland, Oregon area. I reported that my son was satisfied
with a wheel alignment he had done at St. John's Tire at 7301 N. Lombard.

I also had my '86 928 aligned there and I was not at all satisfied with the
job. The Shark would wander so badly that my wife was convinced that the wind
was blowing hard whenever we drove it. All the while I was doing my best to
keep it in the same lane. St. John's Tire would not correct the problem and
told me to sell the 928 and get a VW.

I tried an alignment at Pace Way in Hillsboro, OR which is close to where I
live. They could do little better, and wouldn't even try to get it driving
correctly. Pace Way specializes in suspension, brake, frame straightening, &
wheel alignment work.

Both of these shops produced alignment readings well within the allowable
specs, but the result was terrible. Possibly their equipment was not
calibrated correctly. Their attitude toward charging for a poor job and then
not even trying to correct their mistakes got me so steamed that I wouldn't
take a wheelbarrow to them for alignment. I would recommend to not get any
work done at those places.

Brian Robinson posted a response suggesting Portland Tire Factory, located at
902 N. Lombard, Phone 503-283-3102 or 800-927-2526. I took the 928 there on
12/24 and they did the job right. The car finally drives like I think it
should. It took the mechanic about 3.5 hours to get it done. He drove it first
to see what the problems were, and then drove it afterward to check the
results. The owner told me to drive it a week or so and if something didn't
seem right, then bring it back and they would fix it. The charge was $90.00.
Cheap when you consider what I spent at the rip-off shops and got nothing but
wasted time and a lighter wallet.

Portland Tire Factory also polishes wheels and had several examples of Porsche
wheels there. They looked very good. The charge for 4  928 wheels was $525.00.
That included removing the old finish, painting the inside of the wheel and
lug nut recesses, polishing and sealing. The polished wheels will require
periodic waxing. They didn't recommend chroming, or powder clear coating.
Apparently both coatings require heating the wheels and eventually will begin
to peel.

Thanks Brian, your suggestion was right on.
