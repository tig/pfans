>>Rain X really works and you don't have to worry about removing it.=A0
Like wax, it wears off by itself after a few weeks of driving and takes
just a minute to re-apply.

I hope I didn't sound too negative about Rain-X....I use it on my "fun"
toys, but it's a pain to keep up on my old truck's
windshield, mostly cause I don't get inspired to even wash the thing
very often!

I also use Rain-X on my motorbike helmet shields, and on the
headlights...side effect is that the headlights don't get dirty!

>>She thinks Zymol is overrated, especially for the price.=A0=20

Yeah, the wax stuff is hugely expensive.  Does anyone know the real
difference between their wax and polish?

I'm using the polish now, it lasts 3-4 months for me, beads up great
that whole time, and it's not so expensive.
