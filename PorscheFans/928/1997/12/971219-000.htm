Hi all!

I have posted a couple of times and I thought you would like to know
that surprisingly enough, the car that Stan Clayton posted last weekend
is now in my possession!  It is a beautiful White with a chocolate brown
interior, and in fantastic shape!  It is great to have a 928 again!

I do have a couple of questions that I am sure you 'old timers' have
dealt with already or know of someone who has.  Here is my list of
problems:

1.  The alarm doesn't dis-arm from the drivers door, but will from the
passenger.  It does however ARM from the drivers door.  And the hatch
doesn't set off the alarm when it is opened either.  Also, are the
flashing lights supposed to be on continually?  Mine are, all the time.

2.  It has the stock stereo, the SQR 24 (I think) with 8 speakers.  Is
there an amp somewhere and where is it? I was thinking of changing to my
CD player from my previous 928, but it is pre-amp out only. I have read
that many of you have SUPER systems in your sharks, any ideas from you
guys?  I was thinking of adding a woofer too.  Where do I put it?? (or
the amp?)

3.   The digital clock is in military time. Is there a way to change it
to standard??


   I want to that the couple of people who emailed me privately about my
response to the red '86 with the salvaged title, this one that I bought
is clean and has all the records.  It is a stand up car!  Worth the
wait!

Thanks for your ear, 

Brian Malm
86 928 S   White/Brown and completely stock! (even the radio!)
