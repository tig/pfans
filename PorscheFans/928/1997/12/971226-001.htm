Just thought i'd add my point of view on airbag safety:
I own a '90gt w/airbags.  I feel great about the fact that i have the =
best in technology to assist me in a serious crash.  Andy, how fast were =
you going when you hit that bank, anyway?  I have known several people =
who walked away after colliding with trees, cars and other objects head =
on at high speeds.  In a serious head on crash, i can't imagine having =
time to direct your car to safety-  especially if the steering column =
and oncoming glass from the windshield are coming toward you.  Seems =
like a person would still be braking long after the airbag has come out =
and deflated.  In those few seconds the airbag has done its work.  I am =
a believer in the airbag, as are most of the automotive industry and =
public.  From everything i've heard and read, if you are a small  adult =
or child you may have some reason for concern, but as an average size =
adult I think the fears may be unwarranted.  Airbags have saved tons =
more lives than they have taken.  I compare it to the fear of flying.  =
Lots of people are afraid to fly, but the odds of a fatality are much =
higher in your automobile... =20
