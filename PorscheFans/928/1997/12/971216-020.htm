 Finally had the time yesterday to give my car a proper once-over.
 It had been running raggedly (poor idle and an absolute bear to 
 start when the least bit warm) ever since I got it back from a
 dealer after some clutch hydraulic work. Of course I blamed the
 poor running on the onset of cold weather (it got quite cold while
 the car was in the shop and it seemed to run worse as the temperature
 continued to fall.)  WELL....given one nice day and nothing to do, I 
 pulled off the air intake tubes, airbox, and gave the engine a detailed
 inspection.  It certainly didn't take me long to discover the source of
 rough idle/hard start: the vacuum line from the booster was not attached!
 (Stupid me for not looking for it 2 weeks ago.....inexcusable for the dealer
  to leave it off after mucking with the system!)  Also discovered the reason
 for gasoline fumes in the cabin: the rubber seal on the bottom of the air box
 was not installed properly.
 Inattention to detail like this makes me hope I NEVER have an emergent repair
 that I defer to a dealer again.
