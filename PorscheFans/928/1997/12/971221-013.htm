I have dreaded sending this letter, but financial considerations and the
inability to sell my Ferrari kitcar force me to sell my S-4.

Details:

Daily driver, but good enough to show locally.  126000 miles.
Maintenance is up to date.  I also have the records from previous
owners.  (I am the 3rd owner.)  Car is red with black interior and it is
a 5 speed.  Includes manual, compressor and tools.  Southern car - no
rust.  No accident damage and very few paint blemishes.  Interior looks
good, but pod is cracked on top.  Also has cracks in each corner of the
windshield that cannot spread any further.  Plastic nose and tail have
been repainted.  Wing in great shape.  Engine sounds good, runs great.
Alpine CD with original speakers and grilles.  A/C works, but does not
have the optional rear vents that were in some 928s.  Excellent heater.
Nonsmoker, always garaged.  It needs a new CV joint, but I'm planning to
fix that.  Car is located in Aiken, South Carolina.  $15,000.
