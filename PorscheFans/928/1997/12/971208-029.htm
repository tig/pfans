Hi,
	
	I am planning a summer trip to Germany.  I want to visit the factory.
Can anyone give me some info on who to contact or what ever ?

Thanks,

Don Vellenga

Hello all and Happy Holidays to you.  

Well, sad story begins here (tears forming as I type).  My 79 finally arrived
here in Raleigh from Phoenix, and in the first three hours of driving
it.....many, many problems occur.  If anyone has the solutions, or technical
publications, or even parts breakdowns, please fax me a copy at 919.890.4395.

First, driving along at about 60 miles an hour, it begins to get dark and I
turn on my lights.  Well all is well until it gets dark enough I realize that
my instrument lights are inop.. The lights illuminating the buttons work, and
the ashtray lights work, but no others around the tach/speedo/cluster.  Any
solutions?

Second,  as I stopped to fill up my thirsty shark, I put approximately 21
gallons in, and all of a sudden fuel start pouring from beneath the car, from
the front/topside of the tank.  Could it be the fuel tank filler neck has
split? Has anyone had this problem? If so, what was the problem, diagnosis,
repair (part numbers?)

Third,  I also noticed that the fuel pump/regulator above the fuel filter is
leaking gasoline at an excessive rate.  Is it a transfer pump, valve, ...?????

Finally, about a mile from my house the car begins to overheat, but does not
register on the dash.  The temp needle is in the middle.  Could this be my
water pump failing, do the pumps usually lock up or does the impeller inside
loosen and not circulate the water?  I am looking to replace the pump,
thermostat, fan temp. switch, and radiator cap.  Is there anything else I
should replace while I am replacing the components? (timing belt, front crank
seal, etc.)

Also, I have noticed that at an idle my alternator does not charge, but when I
raise the rpm's above 1500 that the needle jumps to about the 12-14 range and
all of the headlights, taillights, etc. brighten excessively.  Could it be the
alternator is not grounded properly, weak alternator windings/brushes?

Thanks for you help.  Before I start disassembly, I thought that I would try
and pick y'alls brains.  If you have had the same problems on your 79, call
me/email me and let me know what your solution/diagnosis was.  Thanks.

Adam mentioned a couple of things regarding supercharging that I'd like to
comment on.

1)   Immediate throttle response...
First, Paxton engineers are correct in stating that supercharging has no lag
associated with it as compared with turbocharging.  There are two reasons for
this; the first being that the supercharger is always operating at some fixed
percentage of engine speed regardless of throttle position, so it is by
definition always up to speed.  And secondly it is a positive displacement
type air pump as opposed to a centrifugal type like a turbocharger.  For each
revolution of the pump, it displaces a fixed volume of air into the intake
system, therefore the faster the engine turns, the faster the air is pumped
into the intake system...but always at the same ratio, so the air flowing into
the cylinders is always the same percentage greater than it would be if the
engine was normally aspirated.  So at any speed, the engine's effective
compression ratio is higher, and the same...if it is 15:1 at 4000 rpm, it is
also 15:1 at 1000 rpm.  However, this is only theoretically true because air
flow is not instantaneous and the cylinders will still fill better at some
speeds than at others, but the idea of a constant increase in compression
ratio across the board is the important conceptual difference from a
turbocharger.

The turbocharger, on the other hand, provides a pressure source which is a
function of turbocharger speed, which is not directly related to engine rpm,
but rather throttle position and engine rpm.  Boost pressure doesn't really
rise very much until the turbo is spinning near the top of its speed range,
hence power is kind of mushy down low, especially if the engine's compression
ratio is lowered in order to allow a larger boost pressure.  Sometimes
multiple small turbochargers used in tandem or sequentially are utilized in an
attempt to minimize the lags inherent in their operating principle.

2)  No intercooler required because superchargers run cooler...

The use of an intercooler is unrelated to the method of supercharging; it is a
feature which can be used to good advantage with either turbo-supercharging or
crank-driven supercharging.  As higher air compression is used to increase
performance, the intake air temperature climbs, promoting detonation.  The
intercooler reduces intake air temperature allowing higher compression ratios
than would otherwise be possible.

3)  Uses less fuel off boost than the 6L motor....

Within reasonably measurable fuel consumption, I don't see the difference
between a 6L motor and a supercharged motor.  It takes the same horsepower to
go 50 mph with either engine, the only difference being the frictional losses
associated with the longer stroke 6L motor versus the lower efficiency of
using a supercharger to increase the "displacement" of the 5L motor.  I'm sure
that there are many other subtleties which affect fuel consumption, but I
suspect that they are in the noise, so to speak, and you wouldn't be able to
tell the difference between the two cars in a blind fuel consumption test.
