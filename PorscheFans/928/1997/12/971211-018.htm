My comments relate to Superchargers and not turbochargers. There is a
difference.  Turbos benefit from using already expended energy(exhaust)
to turn the turbine and increase intake pressure.  A small increase in
pressure, 5-8 lbs, is beneficial because the energy trade-off is
favorable. With a supercharger the energy swap is less than 1:1 by the
amount of friction.  A net increase in power will only occur if a large
increase of intake pressure is used efficiently by the engine( or a
dramatic intake pressure loss[altitude] is replaced.  To efficiently use
a large intake pressure increase requires ignition changes, different
cams to alter valve patterns and major fuel management mods.  The cost
of all that would would dictate a small block chevy already pumped over
550+ at a lower cost.   I'm sure the supercharger guys would be happy to
spend your money putting in a setup that can use existing engine setup
but all it will do is make some great noises and be a maintenance
headache.
