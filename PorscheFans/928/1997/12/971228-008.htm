Only if you get the *real* Zymol, as in the expensive stuff, not what 
you see at WalMart.  I think the real stuff is made in CT?  Guys?  I 
use Meguairs or Mother's for the wax on my car (not a 928, but I 
would use it there as well).  For my leather interior, I use Lexol, 
and that's what the local Porsche dealer sells, along with a couple 
of others.  I like it very well.

RainX?  Love the stuff.  Wouldn't drive a car in the rain without it. 
 You will love what it does as well.  It beads the water up and at 60 
mph, if you give it a few seconds, you don't even need your 
windsheild wipers in a heavy rain.  It wears off naturally in a 
couple of months (depends on how often you use the wipers) and 
through the elements, and requires re-application.  It does make the 
wipers wear a bit faster, but IMHO, its well worth the cost of wiper 
blades maybe 30% more often, if that much.  Quite a few race car 
drivers that don't have wipers use the stuff to keep the rain off as 
well.

That might be the case for '87's. My research for my '90 as led to a different
conclusion.
In the MY90 Owner's Manual it states on Page 69, "WARNING Even after the
engine has stopped, the radiator fan may continue running until temperature of
the coolant has dropped to a certain level. Therefore, never touch the fan
blades as they will rotate spontaneously when the thermostat turns the fan on,
EVEN WITH THE IGNITION OFF."
On page 106, it states:
.... When the engine is warm, the fans may continue to run after the ignition
key has been removed. To avoid any danger of injury, the fans are switched off
when the engine hood compartment is opened....".
From reading the above, I assumed that the fans would come on, given the right
circumstances, even with the engine stopped and the key removed.

Since my hometeam, the 49ers, had a bye this weekend, I thought I'd grab my
manuals and voltmeter and go exploring. In the workshop manual, Section 19
Engine Cooling, thers a section headed Cooling-Air Flap Control, '87 Models
Onward. It details the cooling flap and fan operation. It also describes a
troubleshooting procedure.

According to it, Pin 2 on Plug 1 of the control unit(located outboard of the
passenger seat) does have supply voltage (battery voltage) even with the key
removed. Also supply voltage is present at the fan output stage (the black
finned unit just forward of the radiator) at pin 4. I did confirm this on my
car, without the ignition on.

So, Steve, it sounds like perhaps there's a difference between the '87's and
'90s.

But, the fans on my car rarely (2 times in 1 year) go off with the key removed
after they were running moments before with the engine on.

Hmmm. I'm still curious.

Any more comments, enlightenments out there?

Thanks,

Dave,

Thanks for the feedback.

I had mine on for a little over a half hour (on the way to work one day) and
it didn't turn off. So I figured it must be broken.

I did find something interesting today while tinkering around with my
voltmeter. When the defroster switch is depressed, it supplies the battery
voltage to the defroster relay (terminal 85a) ONLY while the switch is held in
place. Once I removed my finger from the switch, the voltage was gone. It's
not a press once for on, press again for off, like I assumed it was. Also, the
wiring diagram shows an area represented by a transistor in the relay. Perhaps
this is the timer or heat sensor your mechanic told you about.

Unfortunately, I'm a mechanical engineer trying to read an electrical
schematic so any interpretation's possible!!

Thanks again for the info.
