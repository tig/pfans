I guess no one ever answered you on that one.  I also have an 85 and
whish I had the S-4 intake.  It looks cleaner and would make working in
the engine compartment a bit easier.

However, the modification is quite involved as it required changing the
throttle valve and some of the sensor??

So it would be possible but very expensive.  Probably would be cheaper
to install headers and get the same performance increase (but that is
just an educated guess...)
