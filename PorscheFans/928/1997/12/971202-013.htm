Tom,
I have tried to forget performance for a while when looking for another car
(before I got my Supra) and it just wasn't possible.  There is just
something wrong with the other stuff.  Nothing tangible at times, but its
just not there and that's why the Supra will stay, and a 928 will be added
to the stable in the future.

Its best just to live life and enjoy what you can in this regard.  Just try
to imagine yourself in 1) another 928 or 2) a Passat.  Which do you think
looks better?  Wait a few weeks, drive a couple of Passats, and then think
again.  The hurt is bad, but it passes.

Andrew
