Richard,

  Your post did get through before we all had to take time out to search
  for cheeseheads.
  
  Quite a few months ago, someone else posted to the list inquiring about
  the same pieces you're trying to find.  The general concensus was that
  they were too perishable to show up in used parts circles, so you would
  most likely have to make your own.  You do know that the original was
  just a piece of foam backed plastic, right?  As long as you find something
  flexible enough to stand up to an occasional pounding from items stowed
  in the hatch area, the piece shouldn't be hard to fabricate.  If you need
  a template, let me know and I could trace mine on a piece of paper and 
  mail it to you after the 1st of the year.
