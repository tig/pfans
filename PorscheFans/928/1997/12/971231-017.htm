FWIW, I have used several sets of RE71's on 3 different performance cars
over the years and have loved them...until last year when I bought 2 RE71's
(porsche spec) from Tire Rack for the rear of my shark.  I immediately
noticed a squirrely feeling in the rear whenever I made a quick turn.  It
felt like the rear of the car had a mind of it's own and wanted to keep
coming around for a while after the turn.  The tires never lost traction
but it felt like the sidewalls had no rigidity.  I hated the feeling so
much, I had to remove them.

Now, this could have been because I was mixing tire types, but I had
Michelin XGT's on the back prior to the RE-71's and they were great.  I now
have the RE71's on the front and Yokohama XVS Intermediate's on the rear
and again, the car handles very predictably and solidly.

I don't know what happened with the RE-71's on the back.  Maybe tire
technology has passed them by.  Maybe it was just a freak mismatch with the
Pirelli's.  But I won't be buying any more RE-71's for the 928.

Just my $0.02
