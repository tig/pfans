Jason:
I'm sorry for your troubles, but I'm pleased to tell you that the gas tank
repair may likely be a cheap one.  When I bought my '85 32 valver two years
ago, the PO had drilled through the hatch floor in order to install a CD
player or a cell phone.  The idiot drilled right through the floor and into
the top of the gas tank, and I had a full tank of gas sloshing all over the
place just like you did.  Fortunately our gas tanks are plastic and can
very easily be repaired through plastic welding.  The tanks themselves are
reasonably easy to drop [look for the nuts ahead and to the right of the
spare tire well], so this problem is fairly easily rectified.

Best of luck with the other problems,
Dave Jorgensen
