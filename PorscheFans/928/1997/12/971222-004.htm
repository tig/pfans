Hi Dan, 

had very much the same problem with my 79. You don't say if the engine is hot
when it happens, mine would do that only when hot, when I stopped somewhere and
tried to restart it within minutes.
Anyway, my problem turned out to be embarrassingly simple.
The battery charge was too low and letting it sit for 20-30 minutes would allow
the battery to recover enough charge to start without any hesitation.
I had no other signs of anything being wrong with the battery, everything worked
OK and it would always start when cold.
 
Recharge your battery and monitor it for a while. This may not be your problem
but it doesn't cost anything and you could save yourself a bundle.
If you don't drive your 928 every day, and I know that should be a criminal
offense, you have to give your battery occasional help.

"928s forever"
