Hi Bob,  (Wasn't that a drinking-game in college?)
 Sounds like you have a lean-running engine.  The ceramic insulators, 
ideally, should be tan.  White indicates very lean running.  I have found 
on several 928 engines that an overly lean condition manifests itself as 
poor part-throttle response with misfires in the low/mid-range RPMs.

 (Standard Disclaimer: The following is what *I* would do if your car 
were sitting in my 928-infested driveway.  If you feel any hesitancy with 
"tinkering" with your car, then don't!)

 The following also assumes the ignition, plugs, distributor, timing, etc 
are all normal.

 Since yours is a '78 model, it is equipped with CIS (Bosch K-Jetronic) 
fuel-injection. There are three things that determine mixture: 
 1) the number/thickness of washers on the spring-loaded return regulator 
(located at passenger/backside of fuel-distributor,
 2) the control-pressure regulator located at front of engine, over the 
thermostat.
 3) the mixture adjustment screw (small hex head) located in front of the 
fuel distributor.

 #1 can almost certainly be eliminated--have never ever seen a problem 
here.
 #2 is highly suspect, as I have had numerous problems of this nature 
related to this.
 #3 is possible, but has limited adjustment range, so usually is not 
capable of major effects.

 (Usually, when the 928 CIS system needs adjustment, it is for 
idle-CO/emissions, and a CO meter is used to monitor the exhaust during 
adjustment)

 First thing to try is to turn your 'mixture-adjustment' screw 
clockwise--this is the spring-loaded hex-screw located beside/behind the 
air-metering plate.  You'll have to push the hex-head screw in all the 
way (against the spring) and THEN turn it.  Try 1/4 turn at a time. Also 
note how many 1/4 turns you apply, so that you can "un-do" if needed.  
Remember that CLOCKWISE is RICHER.  Each time you crank up the engine, 
look at the exhaust--it should not be idling with  any black smoke 
visible.  If it is, you've gone too far, back off whatever it takes to 
eliminate the black smoke (a little black smoke when revving it up is 
normal, though.) You must do all this with the engine at normal operating 
temperature.
 After you have made what you feel are good adjustments, drive the car to 
verify.

 If this did not help, un-do the number of turns back to where you began. 
 The control-pressure regulator is now almost certainly the culprit.  
What happens is that over time the control-pressure regulator develops a 
restriction which RAISES the normal "control pressure."  "Control 
pressure" is the pressure that OPPOSES the movement of the mixture plate. 
 So the same amount of air moving over the plate produces LESS movement 
of the plate resulting in a leaner mixture being delivered.
 The best thing to do would be to measure the control pressure--it should 
be anywhere from 20 lbs (cold) to 50-55 lbs (hot). Dealers have the 
equipment to do this, although I made my own from an oil-pressure gauge, 
some NPT fittings, fuel-line, and hose clamps. Although, if you have 
eliminated everything else, and are willing to gamble a bit, just replace 
the regulator.  New, they are about $200, from a junk yard I have paid 
$50-100--maybe if you have a friend you could swap regulators with to see?

Hope this bandwidth-eating, quick n' dirty CIS tutorial helps,

Marc
