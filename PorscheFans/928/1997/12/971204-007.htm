I R&R'd the oil pan on my '85 by jacking up the engine slightly (1 or 2 =
inches is all you can do), dropping the front of the pan down about 3 to =
4 inches max as the pan sits on the steering rack crossmember, unbolting =
the oil suction tube and letting it drop down into the pan, and then =
pulling the whole thing forward.  The hardest part is removing the three =
small bolts on the suction tube, and especially getting them back in.  I =
used a small 1/4" drive air ratchet because of the limited amount of =
room to work a wrench.  It took a while, but it can be done.

You could probably work a gasket in around the suction tube (maybe) if =
you only wanted to replace the gasket.  I've found that the 30 or so =
bolts which hold the pan on seem to come loose.  Keep your eyes on them =
when you're under the car changing the oil or whatever.  Don't =
overtighten and tighten them evenly all the way around.  It is a thick =
cork gasket and if you just keep cranking on the bolts you'll just end =
up in trouble.
