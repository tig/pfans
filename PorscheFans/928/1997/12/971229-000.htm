Hello all,
Hope you all had a good Christmas! 
Got a very nice book from my brother for Christmas. The book is "Porsche - The
Fine Art of the Sports Car". The ISBN # is 1-57145-135-8. It's the finest
"Porsche" book I've seen!  It's hardbound....14.5" x 11.75"....and has 336
pages. 
Excellent photography!
 
On another good note....(knock on wood)..... My car hasn't burned a drop of
oil in it's near 75,000 miles. (Mobil 1 15w-50 every 3000 miles)
From what I read here, oil consumption seems to be more common on the GTS
model. How does it manifest itself ? ..... smoke? ..... fouled plugs? .......?

Also.....FWIW.....(don't get me wrong--I like BMW's too)
The local BMW shop (Ky. Motorsports) has co-owners. They both own and prefer
to drive Porsches. (albeit 911's)  When I asked why, the one started to get
into it,  explaining all the reasons, and the other jumped in and said
(looking at my car) "you should know!"      
They're great guys, and so dang car-smart!
