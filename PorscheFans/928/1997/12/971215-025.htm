Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

Here are a couple of quick responses.
1) The interior light/door gong is located behind the radio.
2) I have a die-cast 1:43 model of the 928S painted Prussian Blue. The
manufacturer is:
			"NZG Modelle" of Germany. Ask for item No. 262 BTW, the model's hood,
rear deck, and both 		      	                        																		
			doors open. The engine is a typical 16 valver.

I received a pre-publication write-up on the "Frenzy" from Kim Crumb. Be
looking for it in a future Panorama.

I'm down to the last few "Frenzy" polo shirts. Get them while they last.

I am still awaiting a response from PCA on forming a 928 Registry. I promise
to keep you all informed as I get reliable information.

Some time ago, I contacted PCNA about producing the Service manuals on CDs.
They said they were looking into it and were already negotiating with a
"publisher". That was at least six months ago. My advice, don't wait. Get
your hard copy now. DEVEK has them on sale.

Happy motoring and holidays to one and all. Ed
