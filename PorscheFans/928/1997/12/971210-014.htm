Adam:

5 PSI is a little more than 1/3 of an atmosphere of boost.  Perfect gas law
says that the number of molecules is directly proportional to the absolute
pressure, assuming no other factors change.  So, assuming no pumping losses
in the motor,  ignoring mr newton's thermodynamics, and also confident that
the unit itself takes no power at all to spin,  you would see an ideal
output increase of maybe 35%.  Reality (at least last time I looked...)
suggests that those other factors do exist, so perhaps 20-25% would be
closer to what you'll actually see.

Still a pretty impressive improvement,  but still not quite enough to break
200mph without other changes.


Somehow the sales guys each try to 'normalize' out the conservative factors
they -know- the engineers have used.  Kind of like getting a "corrected"
reading from the dyno and using it as if it is God's truth.  Reality says we
don't always drive at sea level at 59 degrees and 30" barometer and 80% rh.
So why bother?
