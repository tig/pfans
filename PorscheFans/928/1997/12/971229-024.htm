What they're aiming at is the city driver, who might not put on lots of
miles, but *IS* putting lots of engine hours and revolutions on it.  Go
with
a good synthetic, and change once per year (or by mileage).

Why use Mobil 1 rather than Red Line:

 - much cheaper than Red Line
 - easier to find dealer
 - still way superior to any petroleum

Why use Red Line rather than Mobil 1:

 - under very extreme conditions (heat/hp/racing etc.), 25% less
friction
 - slightly better protection
 - you can extend your drain intervals to 12,000 (or once per year)
 - extended drain intervals bring the annual oil cost down to the same
   as Mobil 1

I believe Red Line is the ONLY synthetic that doesn't break down at
the same (or greater) rate than petroleums...so don't extend your drain
intervals beyond 5000 miles or so with Mobil 1.

>>Where is it sold?  

1-800-642-7958 to find your nearest dealer.

You're basically going to stop the wear on the engine.  If it's 90%
of the way to needing a rebuild, it'll about stay there.  Problem is,
rubber, hoses, belts, vac lines, etc. are deteriorating, so you'll 
soon need engine parts anyway.  Questionable value in switching
at this point.

Ladies and Gent's:

With much reluctance I have recently sold my cherished '87 S4, and I'm looking
for new homes for some leftover odds & ends:

*  One "stealth bra," a Colgan two-piece bra with sewn-in radar absorbent
liner.  Very good condition with one small curb rub.  Used on two cross-
country trips, and the bloody thing actually saved me from a couple of certain
tickets!

*  One Wolfsport cotton car cover, light blue, good condition.

*  One contoured console mount for cell phone, black, purchased from Beverly
Hills Motoring Accessories, excellent condition.

*  One OE rear muffler, undamaged, approx. 60K miles use.

I'll accept the best offer for any or the lot.  Please e-mail me directly.

Mike M.
