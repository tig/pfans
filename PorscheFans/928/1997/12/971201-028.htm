Lately, I'm finding that my temp gauge is not working at all.  All the
other gauges seem to work fine.  Furthermore, my dome light comes on
sometimes whenever I go over a large bump on the road not to mention not
going off when I shut the door.  What is going on here?

My A/C seems to be on regardless of whether the A/C switch is depressed.
Factory stereo with cassette and 6 CD changer seems to be totally
inoperable as well after the battery was disconnected for a short period
of time.  An incorrect code was entered a few times and locked up, says
the PO.  I finally got the correct code from a dealer and they said that
I had to keep the stereo on for a few hours until the "CODE" came on the
display before entering the code.  Nothing changed after 2.5 hrs.. just
a blank lit up display on the stereo (CD-1).  Also, how do I enter the
number zero as part of the code?  I only see one thru 6.

I'm getting really confused here.  Or mice are eating thru my wiring
harness during the night!  Everything seemed to work just fine a week
ago.  The auto is 100% factory with absolutely no modifications made to
it.  I hope someone can help with with at least one of these "problems."
Please don't tell me that these are all inate features of the 928.
