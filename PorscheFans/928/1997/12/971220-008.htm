Hey there fellow Land Shark Tamers!

I haven't been able to keep up with the list in the last few months so I
hope this is not a repeat.

I just watched "Days of Thunder" with Tom Cruise, & guess what I saw 50
minutes into the movie?

Yes, it looks to be a highly modified 86 or older 928 with a monster wing
in it.  It's just before the scene where Cole & Rowdy rent an extra car &
go at it on the streets on there way to the restaurant.
It's in the background in the parking lot where Cole is talking to Claire
his  Doctor. (Nicole Kidman).

Hi, all
I currently have a 1990 S4 with the originial Reno2 cassette player. I've seen
that the CD-2 CD player was an option that year. I was going to get the
current Blaupunkt CD player, but the saleman said it has its own amp and would
bypass the amp that the Reno2 uses. It is outboard of the passenger seat,
under the carpeted cover. 
I want to have my cake and eat it too. I want both CD and cassette.
Unfortunately, I can't have the cassette player/CD controller unit with the CD
changer mounted somewhere in back.
So, I was wondering if anyone knows if the CD2 requires the external amp. And
also if someone has one to sell.

Happy Holidays,
John Weber
