Andy,

I can loan you the 5 bucks if you want to buy it now and not wait!  (Or did you
mistype the price?  You're really going to wait until after Christmas to save
five dollars????)

I do think this will do you some good - I mean - if you WANT to throw a 928
at the scenery a computer game is a REALLY good way to do it.  Next time
you're in Auckland we'll go into my office an smash up a few 911s and F50s,
eh?  (This invitation is extended to ANYone on this 928 list who is in Auckland
at any stage - we have three PCs permanently set up with steering wheels and
pedals.)

If it wasn't for last-minute panic (ie - Haven't bought Vivienne's present yet and
I don't think she wants a power drill) I would go and grab a copy and publish
an incisive, in depth review of it for everyone here.  Yeah, maybe on Friday.

Regards,

Philip Adamson

Forget models and movies.  Whilst in our nationwide junk shop (the
Warehouse) I spied a computer game called GT Racing.  And what was
featured on the cover  -- none other than our good ol' shark.  All for
$NZ9.95.  On the rear was a late model 911, and what I took to be a
Ferrari (it was red, and appeared mid-engined).  I didn't buy, because
they have a half price sale on Boxing Day (December 26th) so I'll grab a
copy then, along with all the other things I really need.  Does anyone
know if there is actually a 928 in the game?  It loooked a bit shonky,
so perhaps the cover is the only redeeming feature.  PA.  Feeling
flush?  Splash out before the 26th?

I wonder if the courses feature any banks?
