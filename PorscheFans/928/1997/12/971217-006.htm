  Since the factory manuals don't provide a test for the brake booster,
  this is what I used to determine that my booster was bad.  Instructions
  for replacing the booster are in the works.

--Part 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------

Operational Test of Brake Booster (taken from 1984 Toyota Supra Repair Manual)

   1. Operating Check
      a. Depress the brake pedal several times with the engine off, and
         check that there is no change in the pedal reserve distance.

      b. Depress the brake pedal and start the engine.  If the pedal goes
         down slightly, operation is normal.

   2. Air Tightness Check
      a. Start the engine and stop it after one or two minutes.  Depress the
         brake pedal several times slowly.  If the pedal goes down furtherest
         the first time, but gradually rises after the second or third time,
         the booster is air tight.

      b. Depress the brake pedal while the engine is running, and stop it
         with the pedal depressed.  If there is no change in pedal reserve
         travel after holding the pedal for thirty seconds, the booster is
         air tight.
         
--Part 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is from my Mercedes Service Manual

   Attention!  In the event of a loss of brake fluid, which cannot be
   observed visually, check whether brake fluid has entered the brake booster
   through a leaking secondary seal in tandem main cylinder.  If so, proceed
   as follows:

   1. Do NOT remove brake booster.
   2. Draw off brake fluid.
   3. Change brake booster if there are more than 100cc of brake fluid in unit.

   Note: The flexible diaphragm is resistant to brake fluid, while the reaction
   disk and the plate valve in control member are not.  For this reason, draw
   off brake fluid only with the brake booster installed.  With the brake
   booster installed, no brake fluid can reach the reaction disk or the plate
   valve up to 100cc.

   (Note: the manual does not give a cross section diagram of the brake
    booster, nor does it explain what/where the reaction disk and plate valve
    are.  Like the Porsche, however, the brake booster is manufactured by Ate.)

Subject: Tires



I just purchased an '88 928 and the rear tires need to be replaced.  Is it

better to replace all 4 with the same brand or can I get away with only

replacing the rear? What make of tire do you recommend?  I live in Washington

DC and will be driving the vehicle daily (rain and in extreme circumstances

snow).  Are snow tires even worth considering or are they available?

Thank you.

I ran Dunlops on the back with Conti's on the front when I first got the car.
I then ran Conti's all the way around.  My next iteration will be Conti's on
the front, and Dunlops on the back, again.  Then I will migrate over to
something else.  

The Conti's wear out too quickly.  And there isn't enough back traction from a
standing start:  the car is ridiculously easy to spin.  The Dunlops did a
better job back there.  They were 4000's, and now I will mount up SP 8000's
when the Conti's wear out in the back.  

I like the Conti's up front, but again they wear out too quickly.  I don't
know if I will  use SP8000's up front, or try something else when the time
comes.

Use the proper size tire, and if possible use the same brand and model.  But
if it isn't time to change them all, then don't.  Just don't match performance
tires with snow tires, or something else like that.  The car will handle
crappy, and be dangerous to boot.

I am looking for you.  Your email address is bouncing everything back to me.
Please drop me a line.  I want to update my list of "VA 928's)

<<Sure, most chipmakers could do that, but do they 1. Care or 2. Think 

its worth the time to put that into their chip vs. development 

cost/potential lawsuits versus saving that money.



I don't claim to know anything about them, as for some cars, all they 

do is adjust the timing to make it more agressive, and I can do that 

by setting my base timing anyway so why would I pay to do that?



Andrew  >>

I would venture that it is EXTREMELY easy, no extra cost, to put torque
reduction at the shift points.  Why would they care?  You said it yourself:
lawsuits over bent engines/transmissions.  Producing a product that the
consumer adds to his automobile himself, at your direction, is fraught with
legal issues.  

The reason you would want a chip is becuase it is controlled as part of a
system.  By advancing your timing you aren't taking into account the other
factors that interact in your car.  

I'm very curious 1) if this "torque reduction" is real, 2) if it is in fact
part of Autothority software.  

Hey Leonard-
Does your chip take advantage of an active transmission map?

I've been thinking it's time for a 928 trip.  I was considering where might be
go to meet somewhere between Richmond and D.C. for a day trip.  

Or, on the other hand, I was wondering if anyone is interested in planning an
overnight trip around VA, maybe up in the Shenandoah area.  I was thinking of
a trip that started Saturday morning and ended Sunday.  

I have friend who owns some hotels up near Winchester (NW Virginia).  I was
thinking of talking to him about a rate for a group of people.  

If anyone has any suggestions about a day trip, or comments on an overnight
somewhere, please let me know.
