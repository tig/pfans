Barry,

I am reading my nine volume set of shop manuals (the best investment you =
will ever make) as I write this:  "Cast light-alloy disk wheels must not =
be fitted to the vehicles with four-piston fixed calipers (as from Model =
86)."  There is a picture of the phone dial wheel with the description =
of "Cast light-alloy disk wheel."  Since you have a '90, Porsche =
recommends that these wheels "must not be fitted" to your vehicle.  =
Also, the "phone dial" wheels are not designed/intended to accept a tire =
wider than a 225.  A 245 will probably fit, but the wheel is too narrow =
and you will experience wear problems.  I hope this helps. =20
