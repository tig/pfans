Hello feollow "Land Shark" tamers:

Just wanted to add my 928 cents. Porsche AG does not recommend that their
wheels be chromed. The is a very good reason for this as most of you know.
To apply the chrome, the wheels must be heated. The OEM wheels come with a
"temper" that makes them strong. Once they are heated, the original "temper"
is reduced or eliminated. Thus, the wheels are no longer strong.

This is not a trivial issue. Along with many other activities in the Porsche
Club of America, I also am a technical inspector for Potomac Region Driver's
Education Track Events. I, along with my fellow inspectors will not allow
any Porsche on the track with OEM chromed wheels. There has been at least
one incident where a wheel split under hard cornering and braking.
Fortunately, only slight body damage was the outcome.

For street driving, chromed wheels will probably be ok. If you plan to do
PCA Driver's Ed events, but must have shiny wheels, polish them.

Now I expect some flames on this, but consider the possibility that Porsche
AG is correct. It's your money and your wheels and your life. The wheels and
money can be replaced.

Happy motoring and holidays. Ed
