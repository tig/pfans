	Well here is my 2 cents worth on insurance:  Never take the first offer, 
tell them you are going to cunsult with a lawer (but don't bother), they 
will come back with a better offer.  Know what you will get will make 
nobody happy, more than what the ins wanted to give but less then you 
want!  If you can prove the car was valued at more than book value give 
it a try.  GOOD LUCK!  Insurance is not there to make you happy, it's 
there to make a really bad situation less bad....   One option total the 
car and buy the scrap car back from the ins company (yes they own it when 
totaled) take the car and the cash to a body shop, tell them you will 
find the parts or give them info needed to get used parts and the best 
prices on new parts, treat yourself to a complete paint job and enjoy 
your fixed car, sell it and loss a ton of money!   See the body shop 
quote included new retail parts,  and you can alwasy get lucky.   There 
were many delays getting my 914 painted, I needed a new windshield for 
the 928, they felt bad about the delay on the 914.  So he called his 
glass supplier, told them he broke the glass, "help",  they had some 
glass that had been sitting on the shelf since these cars were sold new,  
installed $360!   Find a reasonable body shop and be NICE, tell them you 
are not in a hurry, help them find the parts, don't get upset about 
delays.  Look in the adds in the back of the Porsche club to find parts, 
parting out cars.



	If you use anouther car for main transport and use the 928 less than 
5,000 miles a year then call CHASE AND HECKMAN  215 248 4445  DON'T KNOW 
if they can sell out of state....



	Agreed value, and coverage for instruction track events.  I use this INS 
on my 914 the rates are very reasonable.



	I pay $110 per month for liability on my 928, so stop complaning!  INS 
in the philly area is really bad!











	There has been some talk about the oil pan bolts/gasket, question is it 
possible to remove the pan with the moter still in the car?  I don't 
think so....   Lets remember oil is cheap, the NEO synthetic I use is $8 
per quart still thats cheap compared to that pan gasket!



	I think some of my oil mess is the front seal, is there a trick to this 
or is it a normal repair?



	Both cam boxes also leak, that again seems like a big job, I only use a 
few quarts a year anyhow.  With all these leaks it must not burn any oil 
at all....





	By the way maybe we should start a little contest: Who has paid the 
least for a 928?



Bought mine for $5,000   Now with the new tires I have maybe $7,000 
spent.  Not bad, what else can you buy with 7K.  Most of the 2K was the 
radio and A/C.   Very reliable solid car,  not sure of the milage the 
speedo rarely works.  In a year and a half I have fixed most of the 
little things, next spring I will take it off the road and use the 914 
for a while and fix a few more things.
