MIKE, et.al.

I must have been asleep when I wrote the name of the R-12 replacment,
it's called FREEZE 12. It's made by the Technical Chemical Company in
Dallas. The address is: 10737 Spangler Rd. P.o.Box 540095, Dallas, Tx.
75354. The phone number: (972)556-1421, or 1-800-527-0885, and Fax (972)
506-7493.

I called them and ask for an info package on the refrigerant, and they
sent it out right away. It has lots of info answering your questions,
and a lot more, one being temp/pressure chart for the gas.

I don't know how much it cost, it was a turnkey job that also included
two new adapter fittings and a label for the system to tell the world it
isn't R-12 anymore. Given that I messed up the name of the stuff, I'd
rather you sent for the data pack and get the straight scoop. 

Hope that helps.

1 928s4,dirty, and to many others to keep going.For some reason, the
count keeps growing. I think I'm going to have a yard sale to clean up
the place, and have time for other things in life.
Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year to all!

928 fans,

Glad to report that my new child has arrived safely from San Diego, CA.  The
trip to Austin costs $950 but it is enclosed and has a lift to get it into the
truck...no ramps and thus no scratches or broken parts.  I used Exotic Car
Carriers of FL and they did a great job picking the car up when they said and
delivering it when they said and to my door step no less.

I recommend them if you need to ship a car anywhere in the country.  Nice
driver too.

The one thing I noted when my car arrived is that it is in desperate need of
new tires.  While I would like to get a good set of tires I would not like to
spend a fortune as that was already expended on the car itself.  We are
talking a '94 GTS here and it will never (ok maybe once while I own it) see
rain or wet pavement, so rain performance is not an issue, what tires should I
get?

R1's $594 for the set
A032R's $646
D40M2's $582
Firestone SZ50's $714
P700Z $710
Falken ZE-502 $582
Sumitomo HTR-Z $558
Continental CZ91 $722

There are obviously more expensive tires (like the MXX3's that are on the car
right now) but I have excluded them as I believe I can find reasonable dry
performance and wear from the above list without resorting to the ultra
expensive rubber.

Any thoughts please email me.
