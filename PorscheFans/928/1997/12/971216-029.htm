Hey all:

The mousepads finally arrived, no big thanks to UPS (long story).  The
pads however aren't white but light gray with black logo.  Still cool
lookin' though.  I will ship to those who ordered, if you don't like 'em
send back for a full refund.  I think you'll like them though :)

I just purchased an '88 928 and the rear tires need to be replaced.  Is it
better to replace all 4 with the same brand or can I get away with only
replacing the rear? What make of tire do you recommend?  I live in Washington
DC and will be driving the vehicle daily (rain and in extreme circumstances
snow).  Are snow tires even worth considering or are they available?
Thank you.

As an ME in college 50 years ago I didn't spend as much attention to chem as I
might have; however I seem to recall that duPont invented "FREON".  Freon 11
had one chlorine and Freon 12 two cl's thus the designation 11 and 12.

It is incorrect to state duPont was the sole manufactuer...Several chemical
companies made REFRIGERANT 11, 12, 22 etc for at least the last 30 years.
Allied Chemical was one.  I don't know if they were licensed or DD's patents
had expired.  True only DD made "FREON", it was their tm.
