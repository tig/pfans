Subject: Best way o fix cracked dash

Hey Porschefans

What is the best way to fix a cracked dash?  Can it be recovered or does
it have to be purchased new?  Any recomendations will be welcome.

This is a topic I'm surprised doesn't get more attention.  Recently I
saw Bert Garcia's car and he had the dash recovered in leather look
vinyl (much more durable than the original leather) for $90!!!  at a
place called Hicks Brothers in Houston.  I don't have # but 713 area
code directory assist can give it.  Bert mentioned that Jim Hicks is the
one to talk to.  Also, recently someone mentioned they had their dash
recovered for $250 and I forgot to write it down.  I went through some
archives trying to find it but that takes an eternity, does anyone know
about that one?
