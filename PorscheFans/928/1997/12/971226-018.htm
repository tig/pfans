Mike, Matt and Andrew -

Thanks for the responses.  Andrew I'm even shorter than that - 5' 6"
last time I checked and consider myself more like ballast than driver
weight heh heh.  So those bags that have sometimes decapitated babies
might do the same to me, but again, I always wear my belts.  I don't
mind stepping back one model year (and some say decades) as far as
steering wheel safety features...

Just about everything else on the car adjusts to suit the occupants, too
bad the airbags don't ie. size, speed of deployment.  I fully accept the
consequences of any high speed mishap at my own hands and thus why 1. am
keeping those speeds to proper places/events (at least try to) and 2.
prepping car accordingly.  Yep this means most times than not I am
puttering around like grandma!  (Although I wouldn't want the bag to pop
at an AX or something like that neither)

Now if it's someone else barreling down on me then it's up to God's
will... Hmm, getting a little morbid here.

Anyhoo, I will be hanging onto the old wheel for restoration purposes
(thanks for the trade offer Matt) if I ever do take it off to begin with
that is.  There are special notes in the manuals regarding spacers and
horn connection differences for the stock airbag wheel, which will no
doubt complicate the install of any aftermarket wheel from the get-go.

I know I'll be on my own as the dealer won't touch this type of work but
I have succeeded on the other car and hope I don't 'blow' this one.

Whoa getting nervous already!  Even forgot it's friday!
