At a guess - not having an 81S, but having had BMWs with the same gauge on -
it's an economy gauge and it's L/100km, or litres per hundred kilometres, which
is how they measure consumption in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

Me, I still think in mpg.

Hi!

I have a question---can anyone tell me what the gauge does that is part of the
tachometer on my 81 S?  It is a little sweep-type gauge that has 6, 12, and 18
on it, with 1/100KM underneath.  It seems to increase with the rpms, but I
cant really understand it's function.  It doesn't really seem to make any
sense.  
Also, can anyone help me out with european repair manual info regarding the
adjustable headlamps.  I found a broken vacuum hose at the switch, but they
still dont work.  It would be kind of neat if they did.  Any advice will be
greatly appreciated!  Thank you!
