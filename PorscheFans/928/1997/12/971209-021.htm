	I just got off the phone with some guy that works at a place called
Superchargers of Knoxville. They regularly supercharge 911s, and he said
that they had applied a Paxton supercharger to a 928S a few years back with
impressive results. He said he would be interested in making a kit for them
if he could get enough people interested - say 10 or so. He said it wasn't
viable to just do "onesie-twosies". He also stated his team was going to
re-evaluate hi position on the 928, and he said that if they do 944s and
911s all day long, he might as well do them as well. He has recently
recieved a lot of interest on supercharging the 928 this past week (perhaps
as a result of this list?).

Rattle his chain at (423)579-1534. Something may yet come of this. 

In any case, when I do mine, I'll be sure and do up plans for it. All that
really needs to be worked out are were the brackets and plumbing goes, and
since I used to be a draftsman, I will document this in case anyone wants
to replicate it. I will be doing the work in one of my customer's machine
shops. 

Let me know what kind of interest we have!
