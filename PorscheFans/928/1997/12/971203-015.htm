  I don't think that using baking soda and water (and a thorough drying)
  was a bad thing; at least you neutralized all of the acid.  The advantage
  of using a battery mat is that it continuously neutralizes the acid and
  therefore prevents corrosion from occuring.  Your method will neutralize
  acid once or twice a year, but won't prevent corrosion from occuring during
  the time between cleanings.
  
  BTW, I understand that the Battery Mat was originally developed for mil-spec
  applications, so it inevitably went through some (rigorous) testing.
