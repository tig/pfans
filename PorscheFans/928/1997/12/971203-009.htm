>>I have recently inquired on having a car checked out by a Porsche
dealer
>>in the Houston, TX area.

I recently bought my 87S4 in Houston.  I bought from the PO but found it
thru
Momentum Porsche/BMW who said that they had thoroughly checked it out
but the PO wanted more $$ than they would pay.  They gave me a good
reference on the car.  Somehow, they missed the COMPLETELY
crushed motor mounts.  These and a few other nitpicky things just cost
me
$1800 to fix within 3 weeks of buying the car.  Just my personal
experience.
YMMV.

'87S4 (caps lock almost had me type 87S$... maybe that's right after
all)
