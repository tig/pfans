Interesting test, but the biggest thing that they didn't mention to most
was that, and I think most agree on this.  Most wear comes from starting a
car after the oil has drained back to the pan.  Those cabs are started
probably only once per day, and ran straight on from there.  They may state
that later in that test under real world applications, but this point is
where synthetics are supposed to be much better at preventing wear.  If
they were started an average of 10 times per day over that time period
after letting the oil drain down, I believe there would have been more of a
difference.  Maybe not a huge one, but there would have been one.  The
synthetics I believe they said were better, but not statistically so.
