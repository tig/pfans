Someone else from the list responded to your water question but here's .02
on the ethanol.  I live near Milwaukee which is an area in the US which
requires blended fuels due to air pollution.  The only two fuels for sale
are a 10 percent ethanol blend or gas with MTBE added (don't remember what
MTBE stands for).  In my 88 S4 the owner's manual says ethanol is
acceptable.  I can't get the owner's manual to check since it's with my car
which is stored for the winter.  But, it either didn't say anything about
MTBE or it said to avoid it (I think the latter).  In any event, I avoid
MTBE but the few times I got stuck using it I always got hard starting
problems as a result.

Now, my wife has a 968 and it's owner's manual says MTBE or ethanol blends
are acceptable.  Although she generally uses ethanol as I do.  I'm guessing
newer fuel electronics are what allows either fuel in its case.

I can't say what affect this had on her gas mileage or performance.  But, my
mileage is down about 10 to 15 percent from when we used to be able to buy
"normal" fuel.  However, there is no noticeable performance loss - just the
extra cost.
