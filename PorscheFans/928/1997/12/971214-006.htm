<<I find it hard to believe a CLUB(TM) could help in such a situation. 

The 928's steering lock is quite substantial. And the 928 steering 

wheel is almost trivial to remove. I have been told a C02 cylinder for 

an air gun and a hammer is all it takes to remove a Club. Puncture the 

C02 cylinder and vent the gas on a particular place on the Club. Then a 

sharp whack with the hammer breaks the frozen steel. Or maybe that's a 

Modern Urban Myth? Makes enough sense to wonder.



Am I mistaken in assuming you had an established routine? Drive to the

train station, off to work, and back that evening? And you had a

favorite parking spot? You were a marked man. Or at least your car was.>>

I know I am hopelessly behind on the digests, but if this is relevant to
anyone it's worth it.  I promise I will get caught up, just in time to get
behind again when out of town for a week for xmas.

No Urban myth.  CO2 works.  But it is probably even easier to spend thirty
seconds with a hacksaw on the wheel itself, then slip the club through the
crack.

On the brighter side.  There is absolutely no reason for this to happen to
anyone.  It is absurdly simple to install a kill switch in the car.  Anyone
who wants to take the time could find the switch, or its kill point, but what
car thief wants to spend more than a minute or two?  

An additional alarm is important also.  The factory alarm has been around too
long.  Only an amateur would be slowed down.  When my new year starts and I
have a little time I will be attempting to start a faq dialogue with a couple
of others about alarm installation, and hope to have the finished product by
the second week of January

If anyone wants instructions on how to wire the relays for kill switches,
email me directly.  Once you understand how the circuit works (it is very
simple), you will see multiple possible protection points on your car.
