Strangely enough, I do; one such ring and pinion set is conveniently
located in my car; more are to be found in all the other G 28.13 gearboxes
delivered in US-spec '87 and '88 S4s. The intermediate gears are shorter
than those in the G 28.12 (non-US S4s those years) and G 28.55 (S4 and GT
in '89, plus Club Sport in '88) boxes, partially compensating for the tall
final drive but still providing good high top speeds in those gears (55 in
first, 80 in second, 115 in third, 150 in fourth).

>It also pushes the top speed nicely over 200mph.  Probably. Well, in theory.

215 at rev limiter; see (as opposed to SE) it every day.

This seems to go around in circles, doesn't it.  (Much like the objects that the topic
is about.)

Leonard, when we talked about this before I understood that the S4 5spd had a slightly taller
ratio than mine.  2.2 is a LOT taller.  So this means that is one mod you don't have to do
to get the performance we have all been talking about.

And what do you mean, see it every day?  You see it every day?
