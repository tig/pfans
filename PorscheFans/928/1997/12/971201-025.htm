Hi all,

Recently, I've seen some references to aluminium not rusting, certainly not
aircraft aluminium.
Having designed parts for the aircraft industry, certainly not an authority,
here's my 
$.02.
Aluminum does rust. If you define rusting as oxidizing. Untreated aluminium
creates aluminium oxide which is that white gritty substance. Most aluminium
alloys have to be protected or they will oxidize. A frequent protectant, of
all things, is aluminium oxide itself. It is very hard material. When the
untreated aluminium is allowed to "oxidize" in a controlled environment, it
forms a nice protective "shell" around the parent material. Of course, this
process is anodizing.
We would protect most aluminium in the aircraft with a coat of zinc chromate
paint. It's a yellow pukey green color. But NOT Perlanz green. There is a
special (expensive) alloy used for the outer skin of the aircraft. It's
called Alclad and uses a laminate for protection, while appearing like bare
aluminium.
Anyway, that's my $.02
