     Leonard,
     
     Drove the "Red Racer" during lunch using your method.  The first thing 
     I noticed is there is no 1st gear selector on my shifter, it starts 
     with 2nd.  Starting from a stop in the 2nd position there is no gear  
     change at all (went to 5K).  Starting in 3rd there is one gear shift 
     at about 2K.  Starting in "D" there are two gear changes, I assume 2nd 
     - 3rd - 4th.
     
     Your assumption seems to be correct if the trans. is a 4-speed it is 
     starting from a stop in 2nd.  I am a little confused, is there a 1st 
     gear and how does it work?

That's what I thought.

This is why there's been a lot of discussion on the list about modifying or 
adjusting the transmissions to get them to start in first gear (they 
normally start in second). If yours won't do this automatically, you should 
be able to direct it to start in first by using the lever and shifting 
quasi-manually.

That's the way the S4 engine is built, and it's a great improvement over 
pre-S4 Euros with almost-equal peak horsepower but much peakier torque 
curves.

Neat, eh? This is why I tend to keep my car in a fairly low gear, so the 
revs will already be up 3000+ at whatever moment I choose to stomp on the 
gas.

The automatic's brain box will generally try to put you in the highest gear 
the engine can manage at any given road speed, then downshift when you hit 
the throttle, but this takes time, even on the highway.
     
I suggest you try shifting your car as a matter of course, at least when 
you're in circumstances (e.g., twisty roads, highway situations where you 
may need to capitalize on an opportunity on short notice) where you want 
response NOW. You will NOT hurt the engine by cruising with the revs up, 
and you will have more fun.
     
>Most power chip manufactures report to resolve this characteristic
     
I haven't seen this. The S4 engine's design makes it hard to get lots of 
torque below 2500 rpm or so. The chip sets (there are two chips, one for 
fuel and one for ignition) I'm familiar with give you more torque at all 
speeds, but don't bring the flat (high) part of the torque curve down to a 
lower engine speed.
     
More power is always fun, but I think the program you're contending with is 
that of the transmission, not the engine. Please think about keeping the 
car in a lower gear.
     
>when I get feedback from experienced owners like DEVEK
     
Engine management programs are not an area in Devek is experienced.
