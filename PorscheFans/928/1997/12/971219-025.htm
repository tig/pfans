LL opined on trickle chargers in the 18-decemeber 928 postings:

Thanks to having too many toys to play with at once, the subject of battery
maintenance is one that is dear to my heart and wallet.  The favorite
victims of neglect around here are the little boats-- Sea-Doos and
Jet-Ski's.  They have motorcycle-sized batteries that seem to last a year or
two before they strand you out in the middle of the lake sometime.  So
here's the winter storage solution, and it works for real car batteries too:


1)  Make sure you maintain the electrolyte level in the battery.  

2)  Make sure you maintain the electrolyte level in the battery.  

3)  Use only distilled water in the battery.

4)  Store the battery in a place where it won't freeze.

5)  Use a battery maintainer of some sort.  There are plenty of them around,
each claiming to be the answer to battery storage problems.  Lead-Acid
batteries like to be charged hard and discharged briefly.  Tapering chargers
or those "float" chargers are not the answer IMHO, so I searched far and wide...

Wal-Mart sells a cute little 1.5A maintainer, built by Schumacher in the
good old USA.  Approximately $25,  it's maybe 3" x 6" by about 1" thick.
Look for it in a hanging display above the batteries and chargers, or maybe
in the RV section where my local rogue Wal-Mart displays them.  Principal of
their maintainer is that the voltage is maintained between 13 and 14 volts.
If the terminal voltage drops below 13,  the charger comes on until it
reaches 14, then resets until it drops to 13 again.

It comes with permanent mounting and wiring connections so it can attach to
the battery.  The heat from the charger will help keep the battery from
freezing I guess.  Small enough to keep attached even while in the car,  but
be warned that the comparator circuitry in the charger itself will
eventually discharge the battery if it isn't plugged in.

Another learning from the boat group is to use that silicone dielectric
grease on the battery terminals.  This is the same stuff sold as "spark plug
grease" at the auto stores.  It protects the terminals against corrosion
better than vaseline and the like.  I use it on any and all electrical
connectors when they are worked on for any reason.  Maybe a lot of these
erratic dashboard and stereo problems would be avoided if there was no
corrosion...  I also found this grease as "Dow-Corning #5 high voltage
bushing grease" at an industrial hardware supply store.  It may possibly be
the same stuff that can't be sold as implants any more,  but it comes in a
toothpaste-shaped tube when I buy it. =8-)


Battery stuff is simple DC so I can understand it OK most of the time.
