Good suggestion to remove the seats to service the switches.  

Lemme' ad another couple of sticks to the fire:

1.  If you fully remove the seats from the car, watch those rails!!! 
All too easy to scratch the door posts wrestling with the seats (don't
ask me how I know this).

2.  Unscrew and/or otherwise detach the screw gear from the seat sliders
to check operation.  The sliders should glide in the rails as if on ball
bearings because guess what - they are on ball bearings (four per
rail).  Do not try to slide the rails off the seat, they are on for life
by design.  It is a precision part!!!

3.  Seat rail check and lube is important as I found my driver rails way
out of whack and binding.  Amazing that those little motors could even
drive the rails fore/aft as it was near impossible by hand!!!  The
replacements work like greased lightning...

Have fun!
