OK	Hope you got it fixed by now, good luck!



	My alternater is sortof being held on by J-B weld!  I glued a speed nut 
where a aluminum boss is missing from the side of the block...



	Any thread repair will require cutting new treads, the alluminum chips 
will go in the pan.  Loctite makes a thread repair kit (glue),  I have 
seen at PEP boys Parts store.





	You might try coating the inside with J-B weld, get the metal clean and 
warm, if your cold with out a jacket it's to cold.  Once the inside of 
the hole is built up run a tap in, put grease on the tap to catch most of 
the epoxy chips.  Install the plug fill with cheap oil, check for leaks, 
drain the oil, refill with the oil you use and watch for leaks.  Don't 
use the 5 minute stuff no good.



	Are you sure it doesn't have a threaded insert?  My does,  maybe replace 
the insert and use a longer bolt, are all the threads gone or are there 
still some down in there somewhere.........



	Don't know how long the epoxy threads would last, have you seen those 
drain valves,  glue the valve in.  Then coat the outside of the joint 
with 3 more layers of glue, since you don't have to remove the valve it 
would work better with the glue.  After the valve is glued in clean the 
aluminum and brass with sandpaper, engine sealed off.
