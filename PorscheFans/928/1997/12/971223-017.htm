Hey Ptong,
  Saw a post from you on a Porsche newsgroup. There were some posts
from other 924-944Porschefans as well. Without exception each of the
Pfans
recommended other Porsche owners to come join us at Porschefans. Isn't
it great to have the best P-list on the net?!

  BTW, think your web site is fantastic. The pics are great! Sometimes
my wife comes in the room while I'm looking at your site and for a
moment I feel like I've been caught looking at porno!

  I know I've been loose with the exclamatory puntuationalism so I
better stop now. :-)

There is a 928 in an arcade game. It was called Chase HQ I think. It had a 928
with a red siren over the driverside and you had to catch up to the bad guy's
car and use yours to smash it up. I have not seen this game for any computers
only in arcades.
