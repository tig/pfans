Here's one for you...

Does anyone know how to wire the tyre pressure sensors on my 1991 S4, to 
be permanently switched?

I've just bought the car, and the previous owner has gone for a GTS look 
with body colour spoiler, tear drop mirrors and 17 inch GTS replica 
alloys.  According to the dealer, the new alloys will not take the 
pressure switches,  so I have to cancel the warning text at the start of 
every journey and then periodically throughout driving.

Although this is irritating and I would prefer to have the pressure 
monitoring system working, I wouldn't go back to the old alloys, since 
the new ones really lighten the look of the car, but it would be nice to 
get this sorted.  I suppose one alternative would be to buy genuine GTS 
alloys...

One final note to give smug looks all round...I'm in the Porsche Owners 
Club here in the UK and recently in the newsletter "Porsche Post", a 944 
TURBO owner was comparing his car to 928s - his car came out the winner 
in every comparison he made.  Well, prior to my new 928, I've owned 
three 944s (a Lux, a cabriolet and a standard S2) so I feel pretty well 
qualified to make a comparison myself.
  
Interestingly, the 928 has almost twice the engine size and cost me more 
than twice as much as my last 944 did.  Not surprising really, since 
it's twice the car!  I'm amazed at how much better it is, the only 
problem I have is wondering how I can drive 928's forever more when the 
car was discontinued a couple of years ago...*sigh*.  Obviously, keep 
this to yourselves, I wouldn't want to encourage inter-marque conflict!!
