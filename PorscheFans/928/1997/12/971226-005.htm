Phil,

I have experience here.  I am 5'10 3/4" tall (about average I guess) and I
have been in two incidents where the airbag did deploy.  I do sit racer
style as talked about in Bob Bondurant's book on high performance driving,
as I often drive hard behind the wheel and prefer the extra
leverage/comfort that it provides me.  In the first case, the
aforementioned cow hit the sensor directly and deployed it.  I never came
close to it as it was a soft hit.  The second time, a tree set off the
charge, and it left a few cuts on my arm from the bag inflating.  Still,
not hard enough to hit it with my head, however.  IMHO, when the Euro
requirements are brought over here, they should be safer.  If you didn't
know, our original airbag requirements here in the US were supposed to be
for keeping a 180 lb male from sustaining any serious injury (while being
so stupid as to not wear their seatbelt) in a 30 mph crash.  That's part of
the reason for all of these debates now about dead kids and injuries
from them.  In Europe, apparently they recognized that it you're stupid
enough to not be wearing your seatbelt, in a hard collision, its not going
to be "that" much help if you go through the windshield.  I can live with
them either way, but I'd prefer the Euro bags over the US, or at least the
new style US proposals for them.

As for rollbars and harnesses, bring 'em on!  I would rather have those
anyday.  In fact, after my Skip Barber experience, I still feel somewhat
naked behind the wheel with only a three point belt.

Andrew
