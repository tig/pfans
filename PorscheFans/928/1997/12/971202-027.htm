	I would like some consensus on an idea I've had for a few years. It
recently resurfaced after reading Motor Trend's article on the Hennessy
Viper Venom 600, the 203MPH, 602 HP Beast.
	Way back, I wanted to build up an S4 to do the same thing. Being a
draftsman back then, I did up the plans an specs for it. Problem was, I
didn't own a Porsche (Draftsman's salary non permitting).I've now owned the
S4 for 8 months or so, and I'm starting the widebody portion of it. 
	My question is this: How much HP do you think the 928 would need to
outperform that ugly Amercian beast? What specs would it need? I really
think the 928 could do it with less than 602HP, and with a lot less effort
than the Viper. Maybe I'm wrong. I really want to turn my car into a
supercar, and I have the means to do it. 
	Just a little sick and tired about hearing Viper praises, Corvette C5
praises, Ferrari praises, 911 Turbo praises. I'll be sure to call Motor
Trend when my car is done (who knows when) and invite them for a showdown.
When the 928 is done, they'll be cleaning up the American iron with a
sponge, the Ferrari wouldn't have started anyway, and the 911 Turbo will be
envying it's older brother.

Give me some feedback of how to do it. maybe we can get this car back into
the spotlight.
