I like the idea of a blower on a 928, escpecially if it could be made
without having to bulge the hood.

It should not be that difficult because once you remove the intake
manifold, it frees up some room.  Also, paxton should be able to make
a fairly compact blower as the new camaro do not have that much hood
clearance either.

Does anyone ever tried to run on nitro-methane fuel enrichment?? ;-)
