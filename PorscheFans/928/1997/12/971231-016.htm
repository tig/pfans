Is the RE71 still available in the US?  I can't get them here anymore, and I
used
to use them pn all my cars - 71R on the Seven, 71S on the 3 series...

I've gone to the tyre that is the successor, the RE710S on my 928 and it's
fantastic.
The overall grip around the race track wasn't the ultimate, but it broke
away in a 
very controlled manner and was very crisp.

I have RE510S on the Seven, and if I could remember how to get the thing to
start
I'd tell you what they were like, too!
