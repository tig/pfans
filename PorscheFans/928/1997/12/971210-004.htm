Mine starts in 2nd, but then slots down to 1st with generous throttle (NOT kickdown).
This seems to happen with less throttle in selector position '3'. (My imagination?)

Ditto, except mine changes to 2nd below the red-line, at maybe 5000 RPM.  
Kickdown takes it to 6000 or so.

Well, yes.  I sometimes start in position '2', then flick the selector to '3' at
around 3500 RPM, then return to position '2' just as 2nd gear engages.  This
allows a snappy yet gentle takeoff in 1st, and once cruising in 2nd gear I can go 
either way -- mash the pedal, or flick up to 'D' and coast.  Useful around town, 
where traffic lights and other vehicles do unexpected things.

Hope this is some help.
