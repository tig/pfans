Sure, most chipmakers could do that, but do they 1. Care or 2. Think 
its worth the time to put that into their chip vs. development 
cost/potential lawsuits versus saving that money.

I don't claim to know anything about them, as for some cars, all they 
do is adjust the timing to make it more agressive, and I can do that 
by setting my base timing anyway so why would I pay to do that?
