Hmmm, let's see...

....but you were talking about the 850 CSi, the five-liter special order
car, not the 840 Ci, which uses a four liter engine and an automatic
transmission to tote over 4000 lb...

Defining the term strictly (you know me), this could be exactly right.

Do you really want to wave this kind of red cape (OK, wrong animal, we're
not driving Lamborghinis, but the shark-bait metaphors are a little grisly)
here?

After a several week delay, I finally picked-up my 1979 928, and many thanks
to all who offered pre-purchase advise!!    What a car!! I drove 200 hundred
miles home and only stopped because I thought it would be a good idea to
register it.  I couldn't believe how comfortable it was over a long period of
time.

I have also learned that it is practically impossible to keep under 75. I have
since performed a tune up, changed all fluids and generally look for any
reason to drive it.....Your nail file is looking a little dull honey, I'll
just run out and pick up a new one for you., My wife just shakes her head and
laughs as I become lost, gazing at this amazing car now in my garage

I have also learned how extremely well mannered and predictable this car is
when pushed around corners.  There is no doubt I am a very long way from
exploring it's perfomance limits.  I know I'm gushing, (and sprinkling the odd
apostrophe
around) but figured that you all would understand!

Now I truly understand what you have all been talking about!!
