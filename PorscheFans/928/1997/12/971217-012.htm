	I don't see the big deal in purchasing two rears if they are the same
brand and model as the fronts. If the fronts are OK, just put on the
identical type of new rears. Might want to have all four balanced, though.
	For summer use, I like Yokohama AVS-1, they are nice and sticky, and claim
to be high performance. Tread life is marginal. My father has Potenza S02s
on his S4, and he loves them as well.
	In the winter, I would really recommend snow tires for your car. The 928
is tail happy as it is, and with that much power, you won't go far with
summer tires. I have a set of Pirelli snow tires (quite knobby) mounted on
my stock rims that I use for winter. Don't recall the model off hand, but I
know they are all 225s; most snow tires fitted to the S4 will be 225 all
four corners. I f you are buying new snow tires, go for the Bridgestone
Blizzaks. Bar none, these are the best snow and ice radials in the world,
and I have them mounted as snow tires on two of my vehicles. They totally
change the personality of the car, and turned my wife's Hyundai from a
scary death ride into a sure footed mountain goat!
