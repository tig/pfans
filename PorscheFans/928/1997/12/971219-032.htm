Whoa, Gary! There are a few big claims in there. If I were to swap my 2.20
final drive for a 3.09, I could do a much better job in those very popular
0-40 drags (because that's where first would now top out).

At any higher speeds, I'd just be swapping one gear for another; 2nd with
the 3.09 rear would top out where 1st does now, 3rd would replace 2nd, and
so on through 5th, which would red line at just over 150, just where my
current 4th tops out. This would be about a 12% (not 5%) drop in overall
top speed.

If you want this gearing, go for it, but don't look for Porsche AG to
sanction this. I haven't found any stock 928 transaxle with a final drive
this short. Meanwhile, above 40 mph, you'll get the same performance with
stock gearing just by shifting down.
