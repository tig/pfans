If anyone is interested.....email me for info......Quick!!!!!!

I have seen an 83 S sitting at the dealer for about a year now.  It is a
"roller" but is totally complete. (Body is straight, paint is dulling, slight
rust under rear spoiler, interior fair/complete).  After doing a bit of the
007 work, located the owner and he didnt even know that it was there (an IBM
system developer for ya.....duhh, dee george).  It is black with black
leather, 5 spd, sunroof, and has 68K.  The owner told me that he had a friend
look at it because it would not start, guess it wasn't a close friend,
anyways....he said it wouldnt crank over.....so, who knows (starter, fuse,
relay, battery, locked up engine).  I am going to look at it Tuesday, pull
some oil and coolant samples and inspect the undercarriage.  If you might be
interested, email me with a phone number I can reach you at, a ballpark figure
offer for the car, and I will get back with you on it.  If anything, this car
is worth its money in parts.

Merry Christmas to all, and to all........a 928!
