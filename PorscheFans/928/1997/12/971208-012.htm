>I was just wondering if anyone out there has seen any cool 928/Porsche
>scenes in any movies.

I know 3, but 2 of them are definitely not cool.

The most famous would be Tom Cruise putting his Daddy's 928 into the lake
in the movie that made him a household name - Risky Business. If the
windows were up, how did the fish get in?

Next up would be Cannonball Run (2?) where a 928 is run-over and squashed
by a "Monster Truck". I cried.

The third moive I cannot recall the name of, but the main character was a
P.I. or a detective who used a 928 as day-to-day crime-busting transport.
Not a good way to keep a low profile when tailing a crim.
