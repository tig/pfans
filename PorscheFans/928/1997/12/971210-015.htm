Sorry, I don't have any more detailed info than in David's post 
below,
BUT the phone number he gave will probably not get you anywhere: The 
country code for Germany is 49, not 41, so try 011 49 711 8 27-56 85 
to reach the Museum.

The Porsche web page (http://www.porsche.de/) also gives a phone 
number in Germany (and what a great one it is: 01805/356 911 ), but as 
the 0180 numbers are somewhat special, I don't know if you can reach 
it from abroad.

Chris
BTW, the postal code of 7000 for Stuttgart is old; all postal codes 
are now 5 digits (Yet, I don't know what Porsche's/Zuffenhausen's is)

The factory is located in:

7000 Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen


I don't have the correct number for you to call, but the Porsche
Factory Museum number is 41 711 8 27-56 85.  It is likely that
whomever answers that phone can tell you the number to call to 
arrange
a factory tour.

You can visit the museum for free without appointment from 9-12:00,
13-16:00 hours.  Factory tours are by appointment only.

Other advise would be to contact PCNA.

Also, when you go make sure that a non-Porsche fanatic is
driving. When I was there I almost pranged the rental car when my 
head
went into automatic Exorcist mode while trying to follow a metallic
purple 959.

Hi all,

Phil Tong recently posted pictures of my new 928S4 (new to me anyway) in his
photogallery.  Once I parked my S4 in the garage, I felt this feeling of
brotherhood, one-ness in the universe - and until I saw the photo's on Phils
page I thought it was just gas.   I know realize it's that feeling of being
part of a group of guys (and gals) that grew up with 928 under their hairline
rather then 666.

I made the offer to Phil, and he suggested I make it to the brotherhood as
well.  My day job is with Panasonic.  I am responsible for 36 different
product groups in a 10 midwestern state area.  One of those product groups is
our new Digital Still Camera.  ( You can see it at www.panasonic.com ) It is
the Worlds Smallest Digital camera - about the size of a pack of Camels
(without filters).  It takes up to 96 pictures, 32 in Fine mode.  It is Mac
and IBM compatible and comes with photoshop deluxe photo handling software.
It has a 1.8" LCD panel in the back and runs on 2 nicads.  You can run it on
AA's if your batteries die while at a auto show or something.

Since we are family, I wanted to offer them to the group at $368 + freight.
Retai is $499.  If interested let me know.  I would have to work out the
logistics of payment, would prefer cashiers check, but could arrange M/C or
VISA transaction.  Please understand, I am not a distributor - I work for
Panasonic.  I don't stock this product, I would have to buy it from my local
Distributor, and pass them through at cost.  They would come from Omaha, NE.

If interested great - if not, not a problem.  I used mine to take pictures for
Phils page - and it beats the hell out of waiting for photo's to be developed,
then scanned just to get a TIFF file.  This does it all, and can literally
have a picture on a web page in minutes.

Have Happy Holidays
