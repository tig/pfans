Jeez Phil T., you should emphasize to people before they sign up to the 928
List that they need a T1 connection in order to download the dailiy digest
in less than one hour. The repetition repetition repetition is killing me!

928 lovers!!  If you were not in Dallas on Sat 12/6/97, you missed a good
time.  There were 13 (or was it 14 Sterling?) 928's gathered at German
Precision Automotive and fun was had by all.  Lots of pretty cars and great
stories.  Thanks so much to Ali and Sterling for getting the food together and
providing the location for this enjoyable event.

Some there expressed interest and others trepidation at the thought of a 928
on a race track, and let me just say again for those who were there and I did
not talk to and for those who were not there at all...928's can get out on the
race track and dice with the best 911's.  Fear not the 928 is quite at home on
the race track.  It just happens to also be one of the best touring cars in
the world.  Come and join us at Texas World Speedway and be blown away by what
your 928 can actually do.  Some folks like Marc Reviel (and others I am sure,
Jim Stadter, and others still) have proven that you can even auto-X these
rather large but powerful beasts.  So, come on out and kick a few 911 butts
some time.

TWS event calendar:

Feb 21-22
May 16-17
June 27-28
August 8-9
September 19-20
Nov 21-22

Contact Lone Star Region of PCA (you can get to them from the PCA home page on
the web) and get on their mailing list.

These events cost $150 for the weekend which includes 4 run sessions each day
(Sat and Sun) of about 20 minutes each and instruction...it is a driving
school after all.  If you have never been to this track before you must attend
the Fri night drivers meeting, and everyone must attend the 7:30AM meetings on
Sat and Sun.  There are roughly 20-30 cars in each of 5 run groups and you
start out in the green run group and work your way up to the white.

Thanks to all who made the Dallas Mini Frenzy a good time, and keep your eyes
open for a GTS automatic for me.  It was good to meet you all and I hope to
see you soon...TWS maybe.  Come down to Austin sometime and party with us in
River City.  I will keep you posted on up coming events.

See you all soon.  Happy Holidays to all.
