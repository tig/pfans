Remember, guys...the actual supercharger unit itself with some assorted
plumbing is only $2500.00! If you can find someone to weld and fit it up
for you (like I am)  you have a substantial savings over getting Paxton or
Superchargers of Knoxville to do it. 
	As amn aside, I noticed that Superchargers of Knoxville has already raised
their price from when i talked to them. Watch out for that supply and
demand BS. If prices go up any further, try Vortech or Whipple.
