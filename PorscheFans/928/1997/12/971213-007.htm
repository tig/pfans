Hi All,

I saw this subject mentioned recently.
To shift my 928 Auto, I start off in 1st gear by putting the shifter in 2.
Then, when I decide I want to shift to 2nd (whatever the RPM), I do a 
quick (3/4 second) shift up to 3, then back to 2.  This shifts the car 
smoothly into 2nd gear.  When 2nd is sufficiently wound up, I push 
the shifter up to 3 for 3rd, then when it's time, on up to D for 4th.

Forgive me if you already knew this.  I could've misunderstood the 
question.  When I was test driving 928's, before I bought mine in 1994,
one of the sellers showed me this method.  I took it for granted that 
everybody knew it.

Of course, once I shift out of 1st, the only way to drop it back down, 
is to floor it.  Or slow down to about 7MPH.

It was fun seeing all the Sharks at the mini-frenzy in Dallas last week.

That was Mark Anderson that you just commented to. Mark Anderson? 928
International?  _THE_ best prices/stock for 928 parts.  One of <snip> well as
a rolling workshop. Then, he's going to unhook the trailer and kick
everybody's butts in the event of the day.

My dream would be building a 928 race car and turning up at the circuit with
it on a trailer behind another 928.  It's also a good way of carrying LOTS of
spares!

See the Dec. '96 issue of "Excellence."  In their story of Klyde Kwok's 928
Spyder they show the Kwok's custom trailer, which is custom made from recycled
928 body panels!  Mark no doubt has some of these lying around.

The English mag "Classic & Sports Car" has an irregular sidebar on classic tow
car/race car combos.  My dream is a 928 towing a 550-A Sypder (or replica)!

I'm lobbying to have Mark Anderson turn the photo in the 928 International ad
(see "Excellence" 12/97) into a poster.  Orca strikes!
