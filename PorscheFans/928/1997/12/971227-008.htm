Thanks to all who responded to my post on shark food.
I am presently trying to restore the laminated plastic cover over the
spare tire compartment on an otherwise perfect Hai.  Does anyone have
any suggestions on cleaning the cover (removing the flaking insulation),
or perhaps where I may get a decent replacement?
Thanks,

Hey Fans,

Can anyone give me any information about the 928 Powered boat, as shown on Ben
McDaniel's website? (http://www.olemiss.edu/~waletail/928boat.htm)  I know
that Tempest Marine in Miami was toying with the idea of building a 32'
Sportboat with twin S4 engines in it and a massive wing on the transom, I
don't think that this ever panned out.  A wild thought I had was to build a
"928 Boat" of my own, using a vintage Cigarette hull and installing custom
made 928 Engines.  I realize that the latest GTS engines had the most power
but I also realize that the earlier 928/928S/928S4 engines have ample room for
expansion of power.  What is the max. horsepower acheviable without a
supercharger from  a 4.5L Engine, 4.7L engine and a 5.0L engine?  Also if
anyone on the list has 928 engines for sale, I know I have seen a few ads
before, let me know.  Thanks in advance.
