Dear Landshark tamers.

Well since (for quite a while) all I could afford were models of my
favourite
"P" car..I've collected a few..as follows:

1) Originally purchased from the Porsche Factory in Stuttgart: (my
favourite)
    "NZG MODELLE"  No.2820  Scale 1;43 928 S4 Colour: Black/Black
    Made in the Federal Republic of Germany

2) "BURAGO" (made in Italy) 1/43 Porsche 928 S4.  I have 2 of these..
....Charcoal/Grey ...Red/Grey
they came as "racing" versions with decals pasted all over..
...Apple Computer ..Valvoline ..Recaro ..NewMan Starcraft ...etc etc

3) a "Hot Wheels" clone..made in china <shrug> ...no name ...no size
....white/tan.  Again set up in racing kit ..this one says "Rally Monte
Carlo" no.34
and a date (of the rally) I cant read ..no magnifying glass ...hehe

4)Lastly another 928 S4 this one made in West Germany is TINY!!!! (tiny)

....1;64? ..1;72 ?? (it doesnt say!) This one is Powder Blue and made out
of plastic
It is superb and the detail, marvellous! (another favourite!)

I must admit I searched high and low for these models ..found them in
the MOST
obscure places ..in Europe and Australia. Toyshops were good, as were
cheap giftshops
....funny that!

So now I have five models and one REAL Item!! yum!

Crumbs..I ALMOST forgot!..one more..This one is a "WELLY" brand, no
place
of manufacture ..but I suspect China! :^) This one is awful, I found it
in a newsagency
in amongst other awful vehicles hehe..but it has a few redeeming
factors... the bonnet (hood)
opens as does the sunroof. It claims to be a 928TURBO Model#9031 ...hehe

but there's more...YES folks THIS one has a FRICTION MOTOR!! woohoo!!
haha
YES folks pull it bachwards let it go and watch it fly!!..JUST (almost)
like the real thing!!
VROOOM!!!! I'm excited!! hehe.

Now I'm surrounded by my 6 models!!..I think I need to go outside and
check the BABY!!
Bye !!

Leonard Zech

85 928S ...and a HOST of models!! hehe

Subject: die cast 928 models

Well, to my knowlege, there is no good quality die cast model of a 928
that exists.  Several 928 models are made by Solido but are of poor
quality.  Minichamps makes fine models of Porsche cars but they do not
offer any 928.  Your best bet is to hunt down a Tamiya 928S model kit
that is no longer in production (great detail).  Fujimi also makes a kit

that's looks great but with no engine detail/suspension.  Herpa makes
pretty good HO scale models of various 928s but they are very small
(high quality).  If you find out anything more, please let me know.
