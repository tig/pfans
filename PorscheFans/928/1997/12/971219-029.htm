Greetings,   I've been a subscriber for a week or two and find this a
great source of
information and entertainment.

I am hoping to recover an '82 Porsche 928... slate Blue exterior with
dark
blue leather interior.  The car has been sitting for about 4 years and
has a bit
of rust on the rear hatch, sun roof and two spots by the windscreen.
The leather interior is dry and hard but looks recoverable (except the
rear
seat backrests).
The vehicle has about 85k miles and was running well before it was
parked.
I would appreciate hearing anyone's experiences regarding this process -
especially
in terms of getting the car started after its long, near death
experience.
I plan to replace all fluids and would like to spin the oil pump without
turning the
engine over ... any hints??  Barring that I will remove all the plugs
and squirt a little
oil in each cylinder and turn the engine over a few times before
attempting a start.
Would also appreciate information on the recommended modifications the
car may
require, such as the torque tube modification I've read warnings of.

Thanks for your time and bandwidth
