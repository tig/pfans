>What octane is everybody running?

The engine control computers (in cars which have them) will retard the
spark to cope with low-octane fuel, so you will get better results with
higher octane up to a point. The best information I have suggests that
93-94 octane (as labeled at the pump in the US, which is RON+MON/2) is that
point. So, I usually fill with 93 octane (at the friendly local Shell
station) or, when the opportunity presents itself, 94 octane (at Sunoco
stations).

There are a few service stations dispensing 100 octane race gas (e.g.,
CAM2), which will probably not bring you any benefit in a stock car, but
might be worth a try (strictly for scientific purposes, which means you
should clock your acceleration times before and after to avoid being taken
in by the clean-car-runs-better syndrome).

>Also, any additional comments on synthetic oil brands (e.g. Amsoil)?

People on this list have reported good results with Mobil 1 15W-50
(http://www.mobil.com/consumer/mobil1/index.html), Red Line 20W-50
(http://www.redlineoil.com/) and Amsoil Series 2000 20W-50
(http://www.amsoil.com/). The latter two have shown considerably better
wear protection in standard testing than the first.

Synthetic gear lube should be advantageous as well, but there's an open
controversy here, in that those of us with (at least pre-PSD) limited slip
differentials have to please them and the gearbox's synchronizers with the
same lubricant, and the additives which are suited to limited-slip may
(opinions from lubricant makers differ sharply on this) not be suitable for
the synchros. Investigation continues on this front.

I'm outta here (going for a drive on a sunny day)!

Happy holidays, all!

Dan,

You recently read about your starting woes.

As a wild guess, I would suggest changing you're battery. I have a '90 S4 that
had litttle nagging electrical nusences when I bought the car. Usually,the car
would start okay, but occasionlly it wouldn't. I would hear many relays
clicking but no starter motor. Also, the idiot light for the RDK system would
only occasionlly light up when I turned the key to the ignition position
before cranking. Just little things like that.

As detailed here on the list, later model 928's consume mucho power.

The new battery solved those problems. The battery is about $120 at the
dealer. But the parts guy at the dealer told me to get a First Interstate
since they're better and cheaper(~$85). And for me $85 was a cheap repair bill
for a 928 and for peace of mind.

Hope it helps

John Weber
