Hi Sharkers!!
I could pretend I never read the first post about supercharging,
I could almost ignore the second and third,
But, _OH NO_ you just could not stop, could you.....
Now my Shark has read my thoughts and wants to be blown...:)
I can reasonably well run Autocad, and can produce drawings. Probably
not up to professional quality, but good enough for someone to follow.
I have a freind who owns a fabrication shop (and owes me big) with a
plasma torch, MiG and TiG and pattern-following torch. TiG means
stainless or aluminum welding!  I am sure he would bang out some kits,
reasonably priced.  Seems to me we only need to figure out where to put
the Paxton! (and 3000 other little things, each taking one day!)  Who
has dimensions of one?  Which model will force feed a hungry shark
best?  What stock components have to delete/move?  I would bet that a
929 member think-tank could work out most of the bugs before
construction/installation and then we could have the leverage of buying
our blowers sans-kit, and reduce the cost of each installation!  I, for
one, would like a bit more power!!  If we start with a 16v, I'll blow
mine up first!! 32v..someone else!

So whaddya think? Thoughts? Volunteers? Criticism? Flames?
Can we do it Uncle Leonard? Can we? Can we? Pleeeeasssseee?

Ok!  Later!!

P.S.  Did anyone swoop on that cheap 1982 in Sunset?  I did not see it
as I drove by this AM.
