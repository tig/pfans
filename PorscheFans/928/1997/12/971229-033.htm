Strange.  I never had that problem with Rain-X and I've used it for 
about 2 years now.  I've gone 2-3 months on a couple of occasions 
between applications with no problems at all with glare.  Course, I 
usually keep mine well washed and clean (if you're referring to your 
truck).  I also take a damp cloth/paper towel and wipe of the wiper 
blades on occasion as they seem to get very dirty quickly with it.  
But that takes a few seconds when cleaning the car and isn't really 
an issue about whether to use it or not.

I had 2 sony 10 disks mounted in the hatch right behind the pass. rear seat. I
never have had any problems with them meaning skipping cd's. I am going to be
putting them into the 83 as soon as I recieve the rear wings.

Am I correct in my thinking that there should not be silicates in antifreeze
for cars
with aluminum in areas that the antifreeze could contact it?

I went to go buy some antifreeze for my car and was looking for some that was
safe for aluminum.  Most of them claimed that they were.  To my suprise some
of them claiming to be safe in aluminum had silicates in the ingrediants list.
I purchased the one that had no silicates.  Was I correct to do so?  What do
the silicates do? Are they a lubricant or anti corrosive?
Thanks
