Steve,

I don't think you need flaming, but I think your comments are a little harsh.  I've
met some nice people and made some friends as a result of the humorous banter
that goes on here.  I've also responded to people who need help,  seen responses
to technical questions (and filed them for future reference) and, with a stroke of my
mouse, deleted stuff that doesn't interest me.

Sure, some of the humour is stretched or wears thin.  Some of it is clever and
makes me (and others) laugh out loud.  I tend to think of this list more as a
virtual social club, not a science lab with a stern teacher.  

Sorry that your views are different.  Delete us if you don't like what we post, but
at least give us that freedom of choice.  Many of us are enjoying it.

Regards,

Philip Adamson

Sounds to me like you have a bad vacuum booster or a vacuum problem at the
booster.  Check this out first.

And my 2 cents - how about we help these people out who are asking for help
and not muddy up any more bandwidth with this apostrophe pseudo comedy crap.
That is why we are in here.  Out of the 50-odd posts, how many are a waste
of time? Flame me if you want, but I'm tired of all the bull in here.
