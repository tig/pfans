I saw Ricard Camp's statement in the Autoweek Buyer's guide comparing =
his Viper to his 928.  In it he stated that he had driven the Viper 1450 =
miles in one day and that it hadn't beaten him up.  For whatever its =
worth, I borrowed a Viper one day last year from a friend and drove it =
from Palm Beach to Islamorada in the keys.  A distance of about 250 =
miles.  When I got there I was half deaf and felt like someone had been =
beating me in the rear end with a baseball bat.  On the other hand, I =
have often knocked off 1000-1200 mile days in various 928s without =
feeling stiff or beaten.     Richard Camp must have a cast iron butt.

To each his own.  The Viper is a fun car to drive for an hour or two but =
beyond that it's the pits.  Comparing the Viper to the 928, is, in my =
not so humble opinion, analogous to comparing a  Timex to a Rolex.  They =
both tell time, so what?  If that makes me a car snob, I happily plead =
mea culpa.

Andrew,

I called wheel enhancement and Robert Wood  awhile back and both said
$170/wheel for chrome.  I had seen several cars with nice polished wheels that
were almost as bright as Chrome so I got to looking and found Al Reed and he
did a great polish job for $75/wheel and they look as good as chrome to me (ok
maybe not quite a brilliant as chrome but close).

Call Al Reed Polishing at:  714-632-3907

Good Luck,
James Morrison

stories about it guys...I will let you know when I get it)
