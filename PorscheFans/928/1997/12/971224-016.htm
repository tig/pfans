Owning this car is like waking up from an erotic dream and realizing you'=
re
not dreaming anymore.   ;-)    I ordered the book from DEVEK that talks
about the 928 from it's introduction until the final GTS and as I read it=
,
I started to dream about what it would be like to own one.  Then I got up=

in the morning,  walked into the garage and realized, " I do own one." =

Then I got into the car and fired up the engine and just sat there,
experiencing the feelings of 5 liters worth of German symphony under the
hood.   When I pulled out onto the road and I punched it and I felt the
rush, the power, the increasing crescendo from the orchestra,  I started =
to
feel like I was back in the dream..,  but I wasn't, I was totally awake a=
nd
unbelieving that anyone would want to drive anything else. Does anyone el=
se
feel like that?       Alex3@Compuserve.com
