We will be carrying the Anson 1:18 scale 928 model when it comes out in
March.  I will be getting a few samples in for approval, I understand it
will be available in several colors.  Suggested retail is $24.95, but if
I can do a large purchase and get a good price, we will offer them at a
discount!

The distributor I spoke to today that the Anson models
are more of a "toy" quality than "collector" quality, so the fit &
finish on these models might not be that of a Burago or UT model...when
I get the samples I'll let you all know, and we'll see if it is going to
be a GTS or an S4, or maybe a rare "hybrid" :)

If anyone would like to put their name on the list, please e-mail me. 
Thanks!

Also, speaking of 928 spottings in funny places, the posted instructions
at our local self-serve car wash features an early 928 as its demo car!
