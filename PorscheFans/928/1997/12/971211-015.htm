Thanks for the tip about this movie, David.

I was aiming for an early night last night but Vivienne needed to go and get
some money out of a machine and it was a nice night so we took the Miata
for a little drive.  While she was getting money I wandered into the video
store and thought "What are the chances of an obscure 1987 Sci-fi movie..."

It was in the recommended section!  So we had to watch it last night, and David
is not wrong... it's worth spending 90 minutes in front of.  It's kinda a cross
between Starsky & Hutch, CHiPs and a B-grade version of the X-Files.  The
comments around the cop having a 928 are funny, and the total destruction of
the 308GTS is... well... sad, in a way!

Unfortunately it winds up with a big shoot-out and not a big car-chase like it
looks like it is going to, but it's still worth a look.

<<A coupleweeks ago, my son had his '83 928 aligned at a shop on 7301 N.

Lombard, Ph. 286-1669. He was very pleased with the results. The mechanic

that did the alignment grumbled a little when my son handed him a copy of the

specs from the factory manual, and told him to do it right. But for he worked

at it about 1.5 hrs. until he got it correct, and the car drives nice now. I

think it was $59.95 for front & rear.>>

I don't know the name of the shop at 7301 N. Lombard, but you would also be
well advised to visit Portland Tire at 902 N. Lombard.  Joe Vockrodt is one of
the owners, numbers are 503-283-3102, 800-927-2526.  They can also spin
balance the tires on the car.  Some very high-end cars make the trip out
there.
