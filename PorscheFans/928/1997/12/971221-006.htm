I'm not a 928 owner yet, so everyone else jump in here.

The 928 computer should sense knock/detonation and retard your timing 
if it is occurring.  If you are still actually hearing detonation, 
then you may have gotten a bad tank of gas.  If a knock sensor 
malfunctions, shouldn't it cause a check engine light?

If you are hearing valve chatter, that could be something else 
entirely.  Detonation sounds like ticking coming from the motor, but 
it can be totally silent as well to your ears.

I don't know of a way to hear what the knock sensor is hearing, but 
it listens for certain frequencies that detonation causes, if I 
understand it correctly.  You could probably wire up something to 
show when it was sensing it.

And you should be feeling a little power loss when it retards engine 
timing for detonation, but the sounds should quit when that occurs.
