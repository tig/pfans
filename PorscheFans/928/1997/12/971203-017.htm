Tired? Then sleep. This is the 928 list and with pride I can say that we have
something that other (unamed) lists may lack. Many of us have broken through 
the bandwidth boundries to come to know each other on a more social level. 
We've managed to do this through the humor and pseudo comedy "crap". 

Everyone who asks for help gets it. Try not to look at the excess content as
muddy water; it's more like your favorite beer (or politically correct beverage
of choice). If you've had too much, get out, go home and sleep it off, but
don't start crying in the middle of this tavern. You'll only end up sounding
like someone who is used to the stale attitude of those other lists.
