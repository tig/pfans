I continue to have the same problem with my '88, but I haven't looked at
it in some time.

I moved that adjustment up and down and it still never worked. I
did find out you can put it in a position in which it will bind. :-(
Finally I got smart and removed it to see if I could operate the lever
and get it to release. Sure enough, the lever that pushes the white,
plastic latch in to release the mechanism cannot move far enough. I
also tried removing some of the spacers still with no luck. Since you
all have inspired me again, I will try playing with it some more and
report any positive results or insights.

BTW, it's much easier to play with the whole thing if you remove the
latch from the hatch. Just remove the hex-head screws from underneath
and it falls out the bottom, key slot and all.
