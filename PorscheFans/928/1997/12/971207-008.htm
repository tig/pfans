Hello All,
	I just wanted to take this chance to thank everyone for the turnout
on Saturday at German Precision Motors in Dallas for the Frenzy!  Ali & I
had  blast setting this up and it was a pleasure to meet everyone and see
some great sharks.  We had a total of 13 sharks line up in front of the shop
for most of the day.  We took tons of photo's and hopefully Phil Tong will
post some of them for us...... 
I was really impressed with the look of 13 sharks lined up in a row....The
traffic was impressed as well, as I noticed cars slowing to take a look.  I
even spoke to several people who are looking for/at 928's for purchase.  We
had several people pull in just to look.  It was a great time, and I'm
looking forward to doing it again soon.

	On that note, I was thinking, about how the East and West coasts
both have their Annual Shark Frenzy.....  IF there were an annual event here
in Dallas, would any of you folks in the surrounding states be up for a raod
trip?  I was thinking about April or May of next year......Any volunteers to
help organize?  Wouldn't it bee cool to see 40 or 50 cars all in one
location?  I plan on driving to the DEVEK event next August, are there any
takers for a caravan from this area up to SF next August?

Keep the tack in the black!
