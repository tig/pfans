Hmmm, inrteresting point about the patent.  I never heard that fact
before.
keep us posted on the results of your test. Just 2 minor points:

1. It is R-12 and R-134  and not F-12 and F-134 (unless you were
expressing some anger ;-)
2. You should try to run your A/C at least 10 minutes every month.  It
prevents the seals
   in the system from drying out.
