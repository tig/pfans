  Now I'm very curious as well.  If I'm thinking of the bushing you're
  describing, mine has a bolt (with an ~17mm head) going through the
  center of it as well.  As on your car, I tend to doubt that the PO
  made this modification and the service records don't indicate any
  changes made to the suspension.  I'm going to check this tonight.
  
  When I read about Devek's car in Excellence, I was left wondering about
  the cornering prowess of the car.  I can understand pinning the rear
  because of the ultra-wide rubber being used, but when I read that the
  rear swaybar had been removed, I was curious about overall handling
  vs. just straight-line stability.  Maybe the modified spring/shock rates
  negated the need for a rear bar...
