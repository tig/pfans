Ken,

I find the answer from your dealerships pretty flimsy.  Maybe you
should call 1-800-PORSCHE and explain the situation and remind them
of their advertising: "There is no old Porsche, just new owners." and
that with that attitude from the dealers, you are wondering where
you will be able to get the car serviced...  They might also be
able to tell you part of the repair record through their computer 
system (maybe...)
