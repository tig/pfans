All,

	Last Friday, November 28, 1997, when I got off the train I noticed
something was wrong with the picture. At the spot where that morning I'd
left my '88 S4 was the telltale pile of crumbled glass. I hope that none
of you ever has to experience the empty feeling of holding a car key in
your hand with no door lock to put it in to. When I called the police,
the first question they asked was, "Are you sure that you parked it
there today?". When my blood pressure returned to normal I told the
officer that I was certain I'd left the car there in the A.M. so he
agreed to send a trooper over. A half-hour later the officer arrived.
His first comment after learning that a Porsche was stolen was "That
really sucks! You know that the recovery rate is near zero for those
types of cars, don't you? Did you use a CLUB?" All I had was the factory
alarm. 
		
	I'm just waiting to hear how badly my insurance company will try to
screw me over the replacement costs. 

	After this event, I don't think I want to be part of the brotherhood
anymore. Anyone have any experience with the new VW Passat. The cost is
about the same as a used 928 but with a much lower profile than an Audi
or BMW. Ah well, it was fun while it lasted......



Tom
