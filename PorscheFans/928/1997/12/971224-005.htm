Hi list,
I drive my '85 928S automatic about 2500 miles a 
year, and I change the oil about once a year.  I've 
owned the car almost 4 years, and I've never needed 
to add oil in between oil changes.  AND those are 2500 
hard miles!  The car has 86,000 miles on it.  I drive it 
about once a week.
Gasoline, now that's something I have to add a lot.
My car gets about 12MPG.  I read last week that some 
of you get over 20MPG.  I think the most mine ever 
achieved was about 15 MPG.  My wife was probably 
driving.  Ha!
