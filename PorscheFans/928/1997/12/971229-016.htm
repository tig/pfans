Yeah, about that. Keeping my car in first and stomping, I get to (nearly)
that speed long before the Caprices and Crown Vics (not to mention the
Honda Passports recently put into service) and beat them to the openings in
the lanes on the avenues; fun and turns a few pedestrian heads as well
(what IS that roaring sound?).

John Weber, come on down!

By golly, you're right.  There is voltage at the flap/fan control unit with
the key OFF.  I missed this in looking at the wiring diagram.  I guess I
forgot that the flap motor would need voltage in order for it to rotate to the
open position when the car is shut off (if it is not already open when the key
is placed in the OFF position).

In addition to unswitched power, there is also switched power at pin 4 of the
same connector (plug 1) you mentioned in your post.  I suppose this could be
used to signal the fan/flap control unit that the key is ON, and that the
flaps should be closed (which they do), and vice versa.

The question I have, however, is whether or not the same switched power is
used to turn the fans ON (if they need to be on, of course).  I know what the
owner's manual says, but my fans (and apparently lots of others) always switch
off when the key is turned off even when they are running at the time.

While there is power at the fan amplifier all the time, as you noted, there is
also switched battery voltage which comes from the flap/fan control unit (pin
2 of the amplifier, as noted in the service manual).  I would think that this
implicitly means it is required for the amplifier to work, hence the ignition
must be on to activate the fans.  If this is not the case, then bringing
switched power to the amplifier would not be necessary, would it?

Any way, I'm pretty convinced that the key must be ON, unless someone knows
the intimate workings of the fan control system (or is absolutely sure that
their fans have been on with the key in the OFF position (note that the ACC
position is the same as the IGN position, so could it be that your fans were
on but the key was in the ACC position?).
