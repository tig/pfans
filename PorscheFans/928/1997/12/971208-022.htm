Brian,
There has been much on this subject, here's what I remember:
-   Start in position 2, click up to 3 when you hit 5K in 2nd.
    Do not plan on clicking down!  Use sparingly.
-   Run a parallel SPST momementary switch off the kickdown
    switch.  Installed on the dead pedal seems to be as good
    a place as any.  I like this one.  The person that came up
    with it (sorry, I forget who that was, but it's a great idea)
    used a guitar effect switch and box I believe.  I wonder what
    they called it?!
-   There is a bowden cable available from MercBenz which is used
    to test/diagnose the tranny, and it could be used all the time,
    but I haven't heard of anybody doing this.

I've looked into revalving.  There is an S4 in town here that has
had this modification.  The one they have had does not affect
1st gear starting, it affects the RPM at which the gear is engaged,
ie. torque converted.  You can TRY? this by putting the brake on 
and slowly and gently applying throttle (make sure there is nothing 
in front of you!).  Yours may  'lurch' at anywhere from
1800-2200 rpm, depending on year etc.
The revalved torque converter 'lurches' at a higher rpm, and you know
what higher rpm means.  I don't know the exact rpm that this one 
engages, I've never driven it.  This car Rips.
I once had a snowmobile (340 blizzard) with a racing clutch, 
it enganged at 4.5K.  It was Very hard on belts.  I would think that 
this modified car goes through more than it's share of rubber.
