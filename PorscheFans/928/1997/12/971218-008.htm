>Has anyone had any experience with the 928 running out of battery power?

I haven't. There is an issue because the battery's in the back; the
resulting long cable has enough resistance to cause some noticeable (e.g.,
on your dashboard voltmeter) voltage drop, but no practical problems.

>will regular maint. be the answer?

Yes. I think a lot of the battery problems you've heard about come from a
complete absence of such, due to the cleverly concealed location of the
battery. Even though modern batteries are sealed, check them anyway; look
into their beady little magic eyes, and check (yank on them; eyeball isn't
enough) the soundness of connection of all the wires large and small.

Also, batteries get old, one symptom of which is increasing inability to
hold a charge. Keep track of the battery's age; it will probably start
getting tired shortly after the warranty period ends.

>should i invest in a trickle charger from Devek?

Probably not, unless the car will be sitting for very long times. Even
then, be careful not to use a conventional trickle charger, which will cook
the battery over time by continuing to run significant (ca. 1 amp) current
through the battery. There are "battery tenders" which claim to know how to
run the charging level down to nothing or nearby when the battery doesn't
need help.

My car occasionally sits for weeks at a time and has never run down its
battery during these times.
