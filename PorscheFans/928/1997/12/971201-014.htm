My 79's brakes are not working very well at all. I installed new pads on the
front. The rear pads looked like they had a half-life left so I didn't replace
them. I completely purged the calipers, lines and master cylinder of the old
brake fluid and refilled the system with brand new fluid. The pedal feels
solid. It only goes about 2 or 3 inches (a guess) into its travel and then
becomes very firm. I did the booster check and, according to the check, the
booster seems to be fine. There really isn't a clutch slave cylinder anymore
as that was replaced by the hydraulic throw-out bearing. This virtually
eliminates the possibility of a clutch related braking problem. The brakes
do NOT have a mushy feel. I have a solid pedal with one tenth of the negative
G-force that I'd expect to feel when any given foot pressure is applied.

What are the symptoms of a bad master cylinder? Surely the brake pedal wouldn't
feel so solid if the master cylinder was FUBAR, would it? 

What else could be the problem? Maybe the wheel cylinders are frozen? Could I
have pushed them too far back during the fluid drain/purge? Even that sounds
wrong because the car _does_ stop...just not well. It's bad. If I were to push
the pedal of my 84 as hard as I'm pushing the 79 then I'd be composing this
message with a windshield around my neck!

Somebody stop me!
