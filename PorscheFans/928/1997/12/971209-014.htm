There is also the brief scene in 'Body Heat' where William Hurt's character
is sneaking his lover's husband's body away from the house and is nearly
hit by a 928 in the fog...

And although I've never seen it, the posters promoting "Leonard, Part 6"
show a 928 with a tank cannon mounted on the roof(!) This movie is one of
the major contenders for a modern Golden Turkey Award, from what I've
heard.
