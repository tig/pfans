Looks like $275 (http://www.devek.net/books.htm) or $286
(http://www.928intl.com/misc.htm) to me.

>> have a 1987 S4. Recently the drivers door handle (external) stopped 
opening the door. I can use the interior handle to open the door with ease. 
Any thoughts on the culprit? Also if I have to pull the door panel to 
diagnose and treat the problem am I in for a major job?

Any information will be greatly appreciated.<<

Michael,

My '86 had the same problem when I bought it. Part of the door handle casting
that activates the latch release was broken. It's inside the door so you can't
see it from outside. Yes, you do have to remove the door panel, and the latch
assembly from inside the door. You do not need to replace the door handle but
the 'inside the door' part that the handle is screwed to.

The new part was about $35.00 from the local Porsche dealer. I think it took
me a couple of hours to replace it. This was my first time in there so a lot
of time was spent exploring and trying to figure out how the thing came apart.
The electric door locking mechanism is in the way just to make it more
interesting. Be careful of the key actuated switch for the alarm/door lock
system. It looks like it could be accidently damaged in the process.

The job was very educational as I learned some new words while struggling with
it<g>.
