Hey Leonard,

The stock 1995 850CSi is actually very comprable to a stock 1995 928GTS.  The
850CSi produces 372HP direct from the factory, and as you probably know, the
928 produces 345HP.  0-60 in the 850CSi is 5.4 seconds, and the 928 is about
5.3 seconds.  The 850CSi handles extremely well stock, as does the GTS.  The
cars are virtually the same, but the 928 has that animal instict type of
power, while the 850CSi has the feel of a refined 12-Cylinder Luxo-Bahn
Burner.  A very good friend of mine had one of the first 1994 850CSi's, it was
his wife's car, he did the BMW Euro Delivery program, (he is an absolute car
nut, he has owned 911's for the past 13 years, as well as other exotics over
the years), and he loved the car!  He paid about $108,000 for it and with
about 9000 miles on it when he sold it he got about $70,000!  Even the
depreciation values of the BMW and the 928 are very simmilar!  In my opinion,
I would take either car as they are both great automobiles!  Just my .928 +
..850 Cents!

transmission to tote over 4000 lb...

Defining the term strictly (you know me), this could be exactly right.

Do you really want to wave this kind of red cape (OK, wrong animal, we're
not driving Lamborghinis, but the shark-bait metaphors are a little grisly)
here?
