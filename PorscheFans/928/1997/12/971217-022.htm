Ed, et. al.,

You may remember the beautiful blue GTS at the Frenzy, where the owner
(can't remember the name but he was in the direct mail business) was
experiencing high oil consumption around town but not on the highway,
with no evidence of leaking.  

Had an interesting phone conversation today with a local GTS owner (I'm
gathering all the CVR-member names I can).  He relays the following
about his 94 GTS:
	Same high oil consumption experience.  Porsche told him
	that the Mobil 1 makes ring seating a very long process.
	Recommended 20-50 non-synthetic for about 2,000 miles.
	The results were positive.  Still uses some oil, but now
	only about 1 quart per 1500 miles.  Still too high, in my
	book and his...his previous mount was an 85S that never
	used that much.

Is it Brian that is expecting his GTS soon?  It'll be interesting to
hear if you have any oil consumption wierdness.

Ed, if you can, please locate the fellow from the Frenzy to see if he
can achieve the same improvement.
