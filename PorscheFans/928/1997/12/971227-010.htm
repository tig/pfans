If your 78 is similar (pumpwise) as my 85 version, you should not be
worried about the
temperature.  The water pump is driven by the timing belt.  This is one
of the reason it
is always recommended to change the waterpump when the timing belt is
change.

The belt that goes to the cooling fan and the other pump is the air pump
(passenger side,
above the AC compressor (it has its own belt and an electric wire goes
into its
pulley to actuate the electric clutch))

On the drivers side, on top is the power steering pump (you would have
felt loosing this
belt the first time you tried to park.  The shark is very heavy without
the power steering
if you try to park (talking from experience :-(  ))

The last pulley would be on the bottom of the driver's side.  It is the
alternator and
it should have a large air hose going to it (I mean 2" big).

Hope this helps,

PS.  Did you ever change the air pump filter??  This is often
neglected...
