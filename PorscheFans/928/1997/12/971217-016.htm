OK	Hear is my 2 cents on blowers



	I am still trying to catch up after being on travel, been to Bahran and 
back...  So maybe this has been said?



	With a CR of more than 8 to 1 indeed think about a intercooler or the 
charge press will have to be so limited there will be no point in having 
the blower.



	Any crank driven blower will have great throttle response, a turbo 
charged car is fun but different due to the slight throttle lag.  One odd 
thing about a turbo, jolt the throttle, maybe 1/3, and you can get almost 
full power full boost.  Thats how I got  my Turbo T-bird sideways the 
first time I  hit the gas going into a turn, WOW what happened!



	This has been done before check out all other applications, book TURBO  
by Graham Robson.

	

	Due to lack of space consider a charge cooler like the Lotus, use a 
seperate coolant and a electric fuel pump to circulate the coolant.  
Could make the charge cooler out of a aluminum box and a small oil 
cooler, put the cooler in the box and use the box as part of the intake 
manifold.

	For  real fun make a second cooler for the system, mount a oil cooler 
inside a ice cheast, route some lines to the inside of the car connect to 
the ice  cheast cooler, fill with ice and hang on.



	For those doing this on a budget, is there a blower in use on a 
production car, didn't Ford put a roots blower on the 3.8 liter V 6 
T-bird(early 90's)?  Use a different pully and a used or reduilt Ford 
blower.  Just how much can a salvage yard charge for a Ford blower?  This 
Ford unit can't be the only one out there I know I have seen TV ads for 
other US cars supercharged.



	Be carful bolting more stuff to the aluminum engine block, make brackets 
that take advange of many bolts.  If you think you need 2 bolts, try to 
connect to 4.  A broken bolt in the block is a problem a cracked block is 
a real problem!



	So for the trully creative need:

	1. Two oil coolers (one in the intake and one in the grill, or is it 
gill), some hose, fluid catch tank 	     and a fuel pump.

	2. One used blower and some brackets new pulleys 

	3. New intake manifold..



	How hard can that be?  Cost, bet it can be done for less than $400.00



	I love my 928 like it is but encourage others, go for it.   Perfer to 
tinker with the 914, break the moter in that, can build a new one alot 
cheaper than fixing the shark!



		GOOD LUCK!
