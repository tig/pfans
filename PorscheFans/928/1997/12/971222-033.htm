At the frenzy, we discussed adjusting the suspension height. It look
like all you need are: 
1. Dowells cut to the right lenght to check the height (good idea from
Ed)
2. A spanner wrench to make the actual change.

Does anyone knows what size of wrench to get?  I think I measured 34 mm
for the
nut size but if anyone bought a wrench and knows that it works, I would
like to 
double check the size.

TIA

To Dan Lennard with the Occasional No Start:

My car (87S4 auto) exhibited the same no start characteristics you describe.
This problem never occurred when first starting the car for the day, only
during restart attempts.  Wait 10 minutes, and it would start (after many
attempts).

Thought it was the trans interlock, the starter switch, the relay, etc.
Proved to be the starter itself, as my mechanic had surmised after carefully
describing the problem to him (by the way, I'm talking about an all-brand
independent repair shop, not a Porsche or foreign brand specialist).  They see
this all the time...burned brushes and dead spots on the rotor.  Bad luck and
the motor stops at a dead spot, made worse as temperature goes up (more
overall resistance).  Eventually, things cool down and/or the motor moves ever
so slightly, and then you're back in business.

Had the starter replaced for about $300 including rebuilt Bosch unit and
labor.  End of problem...and it really cranks the motor now.  Also, the
problem just got worse over time, the no start occurring more frequently until
it was virtually all the time (I'm sure summer temps made it worse, as well,
so maybe at this time of year it won't affect you as much).  Have the motor
checked, I'm pretty sure this is your problem too.

By the way, the "relay" you hear is an interlock solenoid that prevents you
from turning the key to the start position until you have turned it all the
way to the off position to reset it - try it very slowly and you'll see what I
mean.

To David Wolfe concerning detonation:

If you think you are hearing valve clatter, just about guarantee that you are
hearing detonation, which has a definite metallic ring to it.  Of course it
would help to know what gear you are in when you put a load on your engine.
If it is 5th gear, it is definitely detonation, if 1st gear, probably not.
But when you take into consideration that you advanced the static timing 5
degrees, you just created the problem (or whoever had the timing advanced).
Although anti-knock retards timing, I'm not sure that it can compensate for
the amount you advanced it in the first place.  Put the timing back where it
was, and problem should go away.

To Brian Malm concerning Cruise Control:

Mine was working intermittently....turned out one of the vacuum hoses had a
leak that would sometimes close itself off depending on the temperature,
amount of vacuum, etc.  Eventually it stopped working altogether.  Sounds like
the same problem that you have....leak small enough to allow the speed to be
increased, but large enough to prevent the throttle position from being held
over time.

To F. David Chamberland concerning Sta-Bil:

Use it all the time in my cars, bikes, lawn tractor.  Have never had a problem
come springtime when putting the vehicles back in service.  Just start them up
and away you go...no oil consumption impact, after all, it's in your gas.
This stuff is used all the time by fleet owners to keep their gas (in their
storage tanks) in good condition.  You shouldn't worry about running it
through your shark.

General, concerning Batteries:

Replaced my OEM Porsche battery, which failed in exactly one year (out of
warranty), with an exact fit Die-Hard sealed battery guaranteed for 60 months.
Was half the cost, and cranks my 928 a lot better than the OEM battery ever
did.  You really can't do better than a Die-Hard or other major US brand (like
Interstate, which my Jag has, and which has never let me down, even after
letting it die each winter for the last three years).
