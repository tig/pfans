I have at technical question:  Wy do we need both a fuel regulator
and a fuel damper?

I understand the need for having a constant pressure on the injector
to control fuel volume delivery to each cylinder.  However, I think
having just a fuel damper should be up to the job of keeping the
right pressure in the fuel rail.

My understanding of the system is that the pump is single speed so 
it pumps full capacity at all time.  The fuel regulator only let
so much fuel into the rail, in effect working against the pump in
some condition.  The fuel damper is there to ensure that the excess 
gas in the fuel rail gets to go back in the fuel tank.

If this is right, the system would be much simpler if you only
had a fuel damper.  The pump would keep the rail full and when you
are not using the pump full capacity (well we do encounter stop
sign and red lights ;-)  then the damper would open and return the
fuel to the tank.

Well, I hope someone had a good explanation for this one (other than
"It looks neather this way" ;-)
