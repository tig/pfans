I had a similar problem on the external passenger door handle when I 
bought my car. Unless there is something about the locking system 
that disengages external handle on an 87', I'm sure you have the same 
problem as me.

I found that after taking the door panel off, the handle assembly was 
REALLY easy to get to when the window was all the way DOWN. Try it 
you'll like it. What I found was the piece that was bolted to the 
door sheetmetal and hinged to the external handle had a contact point 
broken off. When I went to replace the part at the dealership the guy 
behind the counter told me that he had seen no less than 5 design 
changes on that part. The original piece was flimsy, made of 
potmetal. The replacement I got was an entirely different piece, made 
of steel and tremendously overbuilt compared to the first, but it fit 
perfectly nonetheless. (The door handle provides a lot more 
resistance now too)
