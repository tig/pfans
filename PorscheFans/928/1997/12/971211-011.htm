After reading all of the posts about supercharging, I offer the following 
928 cents worth: (Note: only applies to EFI cars, the CIS system will work, 
I just do not know the details required)

1. The is no need to fabricate a new inlet manifold. One would only need to 
plumb to the inlet at the rear of the manifold.  (The current air plenum 
and air cleaner would not be used) There is some concern about the 
operation of the resonance flap as this is vacuum operated.  No doubt 
someone on this list would have the answer to the operational requirements 
of the system.
2. The blower unit, if physically small enough,  could be mounted high 
above the Alternator in the area where the current air inlet hose resides. 
(these would no longer be used.)  The belt that drives the alternator could 
also drive the blower unit.  (these belts are available in 1.5mm 
increments)
3. An air to air intercooler would be required and this unit could mount in 
front of the radiator. You would then have to plumb from the blower outlet 
to this unit and from this unit to the Intake port at the rear of the 
manifold. Note: Due to the outlet temperatures, any flexible connections 
will have to be reinforced Silicone type hose.
4. An air cleaner assembly would have to be fabricated and be placed 
forward of the intercooler/radiator stack.  Then of course, one would have 
to plumb this to the inlet port of the blower.
5. 30lb injectors would be required as well as a fuel pressure regulator 
which would automatically compensate for a boost condition.  These are 
readily available from any of the Turbo or supercharging houses.
6. The existing mass air sensor can take care of the mixture as it does 
detect flow and inlet temperature. The O2 sensors are also in this control 
loop and will fine tune the mixture as required.
7. The EFI system already incorporates knock sensors which retard the 
ignition timing as well as enrichen the fuel mixture in the event of 
detonation.
8. After all of this, one would be well advised to use LL's recommendation 
of a custom programmed chipset. The dynamics of a boosted engine are 
considerably different than a normally aspirated unit.

Since the 32 valve motor is 10:1 compression, it is very doubtful that any 
more than 5 psi boost could be used with 92ron fuel. I currently have a 
problem with fuels available in Southern California on my normally 
aspirated 88 S4.  Therefore, one may well have use even higher octane fuel, 
IE 100ron unleaded race fuel.

There is also concern relative to headgaskets.  There is considerable 
thermal expansion in these motors, which will be exacerbated due to the 
increase in the brake mean effective pressure in each cylinder. This 
problem was well documented in the 911 Turbo series engines and special 
gaskets were required.  "O" ringing of the heads or block may well be 
required on the 928.

I have used up enough bandwidth at this time. If any questions arise, 
please feel free to e-mail directly.

De-Weissachization?   Brrrrrrrrrr!

Try the following to see if they fit:

1)  We were only following orders.
2)  We thought they were baking bread.
3)  We didn't know this was happening.
4)  We knew, but what could we do?
5)  We had to join the Party, simply to survive.
