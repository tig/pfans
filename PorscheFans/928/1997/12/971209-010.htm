  Check the brightness adjusting knob on the left side under the pod.  These
  are known to make poor contact as they age.

  Could be as simple as needing new crush washers for the lines to/from the
  pump and filter assembly.  They're cheap (at a VW dealer) and straightforward
  to replace.

  Do replace the timing belt and any leaking oil seals (typically the cam 
  seals leak).  Leaking oil will play havoc on the T-belt.  Replace the water 
  pump regardless of whether it acts worn out.  (Many list members have had
  good results with rebuilt units and their substantial cost savings.)  Check 
  the condition of the tensioner guides as they get brittle with age.  Above 
  all, make sure that the proper ($400) tensioning gauge is used to tension the 
  T-belt.
