This is a copy of a post of mine to the BMW list,and I thought you guys
might find it interesting. Also, no one flamed me back,most people sent me
messages in agreement!

>My BMW dealer just informed me today that the V8 in my 94' 840 checks out
>after performing a leakdown and compression check. The said they will not
>replace the motor or the block until there are signs that it is neccessary
>by failing the tests. They agree to extend the warranty on the engine to
>100k miles/6 years.
>
>I would like to know why they acknowledge there is a problem, and just
>wait around until an $80k car starts running like s*&t before correcting
>the problem.
>
>My Porsche 928 has an aluminum block, and it was originally designed more
>than 20 years ago, with no problems.  I amn new to BMW ownership, and am
>amazed by all the serious engine problems new BMW cars have, and all the
>people who have problems that requres a rebuilds, or other major internal
>engine work under warranty.
>
>Porsches have a lot of little glitches, like electrical, or subsystem
>anoyances, but Porsche knows how to put together a reliable engine,
>something I took for granted when I owned just a Porsche (also, Porsche
>would never allow a problem like the V8 sulfur problems to continue like
>BMW has. That has probably to do with the fact that Porsche buyers are a
>small group of enthusiasts that are better informed than the more
>mass-market BMW buyer). But my introduction to the BMW world made me
>realize not every engineer is as good as a Porsche engineer.

(I can't imagine how long Porsche would survive if new
911 turbo owners had to rebuild their motors to correct piston slap, as
many new M3 owners have to do)>
