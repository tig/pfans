To all Dutchies on the list (and I know you are out there somewhere=85),

I'm looking for some (first hand) info or experiences with Dutch Porsche
Clubs. Our P-family on the other side of the big ocean seem to have a lot
more fun than we do overhere (driver's ed., club-racing, autocrossing
etc.). I've visited the PCA Northstern region last summer and they had to=
ns
of fun at the track! They really got me jealous and I wanna get some
track-fun too=85 after all, the way the police is checking now a days it'=
s
not much fun on the public roads anymore (been to court for a speeding
ticket earlier this year and I can tell you it's definitely NOT funny =96
driving 110km (or  70mi) to fast). Our once-a-year day at the
Zandvoort-track organized by Pon (the Dutch P-importer) is usually
overcrowded (over 100 cars) and I wasn't much impressed by snobs cruising
their brand new cars along the track while using their mobile phones eith=
er
(look mom, no hands=85 look mom, no brains!).
So, does any of you cheeseheads on this list know of a club where I can g=
et
me some real adrenaline-rushes (there must be something else to do with o=
ur
Porsches than cruising along the wind mills on Sunday afternoon 8^)?

Let me know if you know=85

Del Lisk asked about the time delay relay for the interior lights...

The time delay relay for the interior lights is located behind the fuse panel
in the passenger footwell (beneath the carpet).  It should be #21 (XXI).  I
agree that if both doors trigger the flickering interior lights symptom, then
it could be the relay itself.  But it still is possible that the door jamb
switches are both making poor initial contact due to age.  If this problem
started happening on both doors at the same time (that means same day), then
it probably is the relay, but otherwise it may be a case that you noticed it
first on the driver's door and only later on the passenger's door.  And since
the switches are the same age, they could both start exhibiting the same
problem days apart.

A simple test might work.  If you can open a door and have the light NOT come
on, then leave it open and carefully tap/wiggle the door jamb switch such as
to not disturb the car body (and the relay).  I would think if the light came
on when you moved the switch, then it is faulty (try both doors, of course),
otherwise the relay.

One other thing you (and others) might find interesting concerning time delay
lights
NOT described anywhere in the owner's manual...The little red door warning
lights also operate on the same time delay circuit as the interior lights.
This means that when you are trying to troubleshoot possible current drains,
and cleverly turn off all your interior lights with the switches on the lights
themselves, and your door (or hatch) is open, the red lights will be on.  No
big deal, you just shut the door (or tape the door jamb switch closed) to keep
the door lights off....but the sneaky time delay circuit keeps 'em on causing
you to pull your hair out.  And of course, you just keep opening and closing
each of the doors (or door jamb switches) trying to make them turn off, but in
the process you just keep resetting the 20 second timer, ad infinitum
(Arrrghh!!!!).  Talk about devious circuit design!
