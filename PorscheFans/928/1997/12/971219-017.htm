This was too good to keep to myself so I am posting it to the list to
enjoy!
Hey Pat, how about an update on your hybrid?  An inquiring mind wants to
know.

Diary of a Snow Shoveler

Decmeber 6: 6:00PM.  It started to snow.  The first snow of the season and
the wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours by the window watching
the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven.  It looked like a Grandma
Moses Print.  So romantic we felt like newlyweds again.  I love snow!

December 7:  We woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white snow covering
every inch of the landscape.  What a fantastic sight!  Can there be a more
lovely place in the whole world?  Moving here was the best idea I've ever
had.  Shoveled for the first time in years and felt like a boy again.  I
didi both our driveway and the sidewalks.  This afternoon the snowplow came
along and covered up the sidewalks and closed in the driveway, so I got to
shovel again.  What a perfect life.

December 12:  The sun has melted all our lovely snow.  Such a
disappointment.  my neighbor tells me not to worry, we'll definitely have a
white Christmas.  No snow on Christmas would be awful!  Bob says we'll have
so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll never want to see snow again. 
I don't think that's possible.  Bob is such a nice man.  I'm glad he's our
neighbor.

December 14:  Snow lovely snow!  8" last night.  The temperature dropped to
-20.  The cold makes everything sparkle so.  The wind took my breath away,
but I warmed up by shoveling the driveway and siedwalks.  This is a the
life!  The snowplow came back this afternoon and buried everything again. 
I didn't realize I would have to do quite this much shoveling, but I'll
certainly get back in shape this way.

December 15:  20 inches forecast.  Sold my van and bought a 4x4 Blazer. 
Bought snow tires for the wife's car and 2 extra shovels.  stocked the
freezer.  The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity goes out.  I
think that's silly.  We aren't in Alaska, after all.

December 16:  Ice storm this morning.  Fell on my ass on the ice in the
driveway puttting down salt.  Hurt like hell.  The wife laughed for an
hour, which I think was very cruel.

December 17:  Still way below freezing.  Roads are too icy to go anywhere. 
Electricity was off for 5 hours.  I had to pile the blankets on to stay
warm.  Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to irritate her. 
Guess I should've bought a wood stove, but won't admit it to her.  I hate
it when she's right.  I can't believe I'm freezing to death in my own
living room.

December 20:  Electricity's back on, but another 14" of the damn stuff last
night.  More shoveling.  Took all day.  Dam snowplow came by twice.  Tried
to find a neighbor's kid to shovel, but they said they're too busy playing
hockey.  I think they're lying.  Called the only hardware store around to
see about buying a snow blower and they're out.  Might have another
shipment in March.  I think they're lying.  Bob says I have to shovel or
the city will have it done and bill me.  I think he's lying.

December 22:  Bob was right about a white Christmas because 13 more inches
of the white shit fell today, and it's so cold it probably won't melt till
August.  Took me 45 minuets to get all dressed up to go out to shove and
then I had to urinate.  By the time I got undressed, urinated and dressed
again, I was too tired to shovel.  Tried to hire Bob who has a plow on his
truck for the rest of the winter; but he says he's too busy.  I think the
asshole is lying.

December 23:  Only 2" of snow today.  And it warmed up to 0.  The wife
wanted me to decorate the front of the house this morning.  What is she
nuts?!  Why didn't she tell me to do that a month ago?  She says she did
but I think she's lying.

December 24:  6".  Snow packed so hard by snowplow, I broke the shovel. 
Thought I was having a heart attack.  If I ever catch the son of a bitch
who drives that snowplow, I'll drag him through the snow by his balls.  I
know he hides around the corner and waits for me to finish shoveling and
then he comes donw the street at a 100 miles an hour and throws snow all
over where I've been!  Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmas carols
with her and open our presents, but I was too busy watching for the damn
snowplow.

December 25:  Merry Christmas.  20 more inches of the !=@x@%# slop tonight.
 Snowed in.  The idea of shoveling makes my blood boil.  I hate the snow! 
The the snowplow driver came by asking for a donation and I hit him over
the head with my shovel.  The wife says I have a bad attitude.  I think she
is an idiot.  If I have to watch "It's A Wonderful Life" one more time, I'm
going to kill her.

December 26:  Still snowed in.  Why the hell did I ever move here?  It was
all HER idea.  She's really getting on my nerves.

December 27:  Temperature dropped to -30 and the pipes froze.

December 28:  Warmed up to above -20.  Still snowed in.  She is driving me
crazy

December 29:  10 more inches.  Bob says I have to shovel the roof or it
could cave in.  That's the silliest thing I ever heard.  How dumb does he
think I am?

December 20:  Roof caved in.  The snowplow driver is suing me for a million
dollars.  The wife went home to her mother.  9 inches predicted.

December 31:  Set fire to what's left of the house.  No more shoveling.

January 8:  I feel so good. I just love those little white pills they keep
giving me.  Why am I tied to the bed?
