I have a story that will make anyone buying a 928 think twice about "low =
Miles"! Earlier this year I spotted a 87 928S4(96,000 miles) that was =
advertised for sale and after looking over the car and finding many =
problem, only small but never less... problems. at that time we could =
not agree on a selling price so I passed the car as gone forever. Just =
last week after reading another add in the local newspaper for a black =
928 with only 55,000 miles I decided to take a look and see what could =
happen. Well, after looking the car over it started to look very =
familiar in that the 928 had the same problems as one that I inspected =
almost 6 months ago. Lucky I keep track of the cars I looked at and =
guess what... the serial numbers matched(!!). Well as the stories goes, =
the present bought it off a small used car lot, which bought it from the =
previous owner. Just a word of caution for all buyer out there. Needless =
to say the deal never went through as this person paid way to much for =
the car and since I now know the 928 has well over 100,000 miles...
