 I have a finished set of brackets for mounting a VorTech to any 928.  
Since it mounts on the water-pump, a modified water neck is also required 
to clear the back of the VorTech.  This also necessitates conversion to 
electric radiator fan (which frees up a few more ponies, anyway). I would 
feel very confident that 5-6lbs of boost on a 10:1 engine would be safe.  
However, in my case, I am installing 944 Turbo pistons which a) moves the 
static CR to 8:1, and b) are forged aluminum.  This allows me to run much 
higher boost levels (16-18lbs with intercooler) to achieve the design 
goal of 700hp.

I agree with this.  I had a Roots-type blower on the aforementioned 
vehicle running at 7.5lbs boost.  Although I never actually dyno'ed it, 
the torque was unbelievable.  I would have to estimate it at twice stock, 
at the lower rpms tapering to 30% more in the highest rpms.  On the new 
system, I don't expect as much increase on the low end torque, as the 
VorTech is a centrifugal unit.  The Roots-type was a positive 
displacement. (I was at 7.5lbs boost at 1800rpm--that's why torque 
skyrocketed.)

 When I finish everything up with all the final mod's, I'll be happy to 
share the dimensioning and such with anyone (Leonard?)
