That is one function, but not the most important.

Sorry, this is not correct. There is not a fixed relationship between
pressure and density. Imagine a sealed container with room air inside and a
pressure gauge mounted. Put the container on the stove so the air inside
gets hot. As the temperature rises, the pressure will too, due to the
higher average velocity of the gas molecules. The amount of air inside the
container hasn't changed, nor has the container's volume (at least not very
much), so the density of the air (mass per unit volume) is unchanged.

Also not so, though it's a tasty notion. You'll only get more power of the
engine if you can put a greater mass of air into the cylinder, so you can
burn more fuel. If (following the thought experiment above) you don't
intercool, you'll increase the pressure (which is not directly beneficial
and can cause problems) much more than the mass of air delivered to the
cylinder.

You can get away without an intercooler at low boost, particularly with a
positive-displacement supercharger (which will heat the air less than a
centrifugal supercharger, whether belt- or turbine-driven), but it always
helps to use one and becomes necessary to get any net benefit from raising
the boost.
