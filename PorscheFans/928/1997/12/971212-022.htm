I have been told that Paxton has a somewhat spotty reputation but I have
no personal experience with Paxton or any other brand of blower.
However, I have heard nothing but good reports on Vortex.
Unfortunately, they have no product for 928, but do a lot of Chevy and
Ford applications.  I think you should also talk with Vortex.

I'm interested.  A blower seems ideal for the older 16v US engines.  The
early 4.5L engines have only a 8.5 or 9.0:1 compression ratio (my '82 is
9.3:1), so 6-7 lbst of boost might even be possible without an
intercooler or similar extra plumbing that you may need on the 10.0:1 CR
engines. But, I'm kind of stuck on the concept of how/where to plumb it
into the existing intake.  I know that some blowers pull through and
some push through.  Which were you considering?   There's not a lot of
extra space in either 16v or 32v engine compartments....

Another possiblity might be an electric blower.  I found a company who
has developed one for motorcycle engines and smaller (2.0 liter) autos.
The electric blower would eliminate the need to find space for pulleys
and belts, and perhaps even allow for some fancy variable boost control
- i.e. just turn up the dial...
