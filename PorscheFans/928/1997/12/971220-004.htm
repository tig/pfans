I didn't see a response to your question about minimizing the headlight
bounce described in your post.   Here's what I did to solve mine:

1.    Open hood and locate actuator rod for headlight pods.   You can't
miss the sucker - it's the one running across the top of the nose over
the hood latch mechanism - motor on your right with bellcrank attached
to the rod.
2.    You will see  a clinch at either end of the tube with two 8mm (I
think) bolts running through each 'clinch' - which clamps the headlight
pod operating rod to that actuator tube.
3.    Pull the rubber boot off the top of the headlight motor and rotate
the knob on the top of the motor until the headlights come up about half
way, or you get good access to the bolt heads.   Loosen both bolts - but
no need to remove them - on the side to be adjusted.
4.    You have options at this point:   You can grasp the rod by hand
and carefully maneuver the pod so it rotates "more open" while holding
the actuating rod in place; you can take large channel locks to hold
onto the 'clinch' and while holding your hand behind the headlight pod,
carefully rotate the clinch so that you change the orientation between
pod rod and clinch.
5.    Temporarily tighten the clinch bolts and test positions by
manually cranking the motor knob until the headlights are totally
deployed.   You will see whether you need to 'back off' or rotate more
in order to insure the proper positions.   It is possible that putting
one side right may inadvertantly put the other side out - but you can
adjust both sides until you get it just right.   This is a good time to
check that each headlight pod is positioned exactly in the center of
'the hole' in the fender.   It's horizontal location is adjusted in the
same way - simply moving the pod rod further into or out of the clinch.

There are a couple of 'stops' in the headlight mechanism that you can
see when fully closed (it's a bolt that keeps the pod in proper position
so it doesn't go too far into the fender) - but highly unlikely it needs
to be adjusted.   The full 'up' position is determined by the two ears
on top of the headlight housing that limit the travel - and prevent
bouncing.

It's pretty easy, and you'll get it back to specs with a little patience
and care.

Hope this helps......good luck!
