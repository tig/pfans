Barry,

  Your previous message did go through and a few people replied.  Check the
  archives over the past few days.
  
  I can't remember whether I replied to your post or a similar one, but there
  is a 928 owner here in Austin that is using 16" (be aware that there are
  15" versions as well) on her late '86 that has S4 brakes.  The wheels
  are 7" wide front and rear and she hasn't reported any problems with
  the fitment.
  
  They will hold a 225/50-16, but they will NOT hold a 245/45-16; you need
  at least an 8" rim width to support a 245/45 (according to BF Goodrich
  fitment charts for their R1s).
  
  What I don't know is whether the phone dials that the owner has fitted
  to her 928 were OE on a 928 or some other model (944 or 911).
  
  BTW, I'm assuming that your car is an automatic if it is an S4.  I know
  that the 5-speeds (i.e. GT) were fitted with the Design 90/pressure sensors
  as standard equipment.  I don't know whether the '90 S4 continued with
  the flat dish setup from the previous years or whether it also used the
   Design 90 wheels.
