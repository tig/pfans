Something's leaking in the clutch hydraulic system. It could be the slave
cylinder, but could also be the master, or some part of the line between
them. Check everything. Remember to bleed the system after repairing and
refilling.

HELP, I need more tech help!

Often I pull into the garage with the electric cooling fans running. I turn
the engine off and about 2-3 seconds later, the fans stop. The fans DON'T come
on again. I would think that if the parameters are hot enough to turn the fans
on with the engine running, and the engine usually gets hotter before it cools
off after it is shut down, then the fans should continue to run with the
engine shut down and the key removed. They don't! I turn the key to the
ignition position (all the idiot lights on) and the fans come on again. I know
there's a switch under the hood that disables the fan circuit if the hood is
raised. That was my first suspect. But it checked out okay, using the
procedure in the factory workshop manual.

So, the fans won't come on when the key is removed even though ithe engine was
hot enough to kick on the fans before I turned of the motor. I had a 944 Turbo
S that would keep running the fans after I removed the key, if they were
runing just prior to stopping the engine. I know it's a different motor,
but....??

Any feed back is appreciated. I just leave the key in the ignition position
until the fans stop, but that's probably not a good thing to do in the long
run. Also, I pop the hood after that just to remove as much heat as I can.

Thanks,
