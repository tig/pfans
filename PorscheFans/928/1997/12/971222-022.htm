Yes, a huge one; apart from sticking much better and responding more
crisply to steering input, they will probably work better in the rain and
ride more smoothly and quietly. These two, along with the Michelin Pilot SX
MXX3, are probably the best performance tires available (though Pirelli
still sometimes has QC problems). If you don't mind paying for them, you'll
be really pleased. Make sure you get them in Porsche spec (e.g., N3 for
Bridgestone, N1 for Michelin; don't mix N-spec values).

Some tires, both sedan and sport sizes, have a "P" prefix before the size.
This is left over from a time when US car makers determined that they could
get meaningful improvements in fuel economy by running tires at higher
pressures, so they negotiated with their OEM tire makers (e.g., Goodyear)
to make tires which were comfortable running at least 36 psi. These are
distinguished by the "P" (for "pressure") prefix.

Typical "P-metric" (so called because these were some of the first tires
for US cars to carry metric size designations) tires come in sizes for
Caprices, Corvettes, Camaros, and the like. Because none of these takes any
of the supertires mentioned above as OEM equipment, those tires, along with
the others fitted as OEM by Porsche, don't come in P sizes.
