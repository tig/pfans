First, as a newbie, I like to extend by thanks to everyone on the
list. It's great!  Just have patience with a new owner.  Before long
I'll be slinging around random punctuation and sports seats with the
best of 'em :)

Thanks to Del Lisk, Philip Adamson and Sam Herrin for responses to my
post.

1) I think the squeaky steering wheel is due to temperature.  It seems
to squeak when it's cold (30-35 degrees F) but not when it's warmer.
It was 32F when we started and warmed up to the mid 40s by the
afternoon.

2) Oil consumption: Since the weather up here in Bean-town Land is
unseasonably warm I took the SO shopping today - about 250 miles in
and around I-495 and back.  If anybody out there saw a metallic
blue/green blur - that was us :)

The Shark went through about 1/2 quart.  That's a total of about 2
quarts in the last 1500 miles.  When I got home I checked the engine
bay from the top - no visible signs.  I also poked my fingers around
the under-tray in an attempt to see if there was any residue on it -
none.  I'm not sure how much more checking I can do without putting it
on a lift and removing the under-tray.  

Based on Del's post (he changes his oil every 1K miles) I feel guilty
about not having changed the oil already.  Now, for the next question:
Is it possible to change the oil _without_ putting it on a lift or
ramps?  I guess I'll look through my owners manual and the shop manual
(which I got for $278 from 928 International Last week FYI).

AND one more question: In anticipation of a normal (i.e. _cold_,
snowy, salty) Boston winter last month I put the Beast into
storage. Part of the process was putting the requisite amount of fuel
stabilizer in with a full tank.  Is is possible that the stabilizer is
effecting the oil consumption?  Does anyone else out there store their
Shark from time-to-time with Sta-Bil?  

I was planning on storing it until spring but with the weather here I
just had to drive it.  Does anybody know of any ill-effects from
running through too many tanks of fuel with stabilizer?

OK. So that was three questions. Sorry.


AND NOW - just so you know I'm trying to earn my keep :)

On the way to one of the SO's favorite places to melt the credit card
she saw a small sign: "Exotic Car Models" or some-such.  We followed
the signs and parked next to a Ferrari Testerossa (the genuine 1:1
kind). Owner and cohort were looking under the hood - the front
one. Personally, I think what's under the lid in the back is _much_
more interesting but then what do I know?  I can't even about spell
the names right.

We went in hoping to find some 928 models. I was planning to buy a
whole bunch and offer them on the list for cost + shipping but alas
there were none.  They had a whole warehouse full of metal models from
dozens of manufacturers - 911s, GT1s, 550s, 355s, stock cars, F1s,
SLKs, you name it - but not a single 928.  I almost bought the Mobil 1
911 GT1 - 'cause it looks more like a 928 than a 911.

Oh well.  I guess I'm not surprised that there weren't any 928 models.

In any case, she's made off with the catalog. I'll try to pry it away
from her fingers tomorrow and post any relevant information from the
catalog for those interested in any models _other_ than 928s.


In closing, I'll post a small excerpt from my response to Philip:


I-495 is a three-lane wide highway with rolling hills.  Today, as I
come over the top of a rise I saw about 3 miles of three lane-wide
highway bathed in winter sunshine.  The beauty was marred only by a
dozen or so cars.  I mentioned to the SO: "Look: Pylons."


Before you flame: I didn't. But, I thought about it...
