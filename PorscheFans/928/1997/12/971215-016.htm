Mark,
 I had a receiver hitch welded to the rear bumper with two triangulated 
supports.  Behind the license plate, a square hole was cut into the rear 
bumper cover where the receiver was lined up and welded flush with the 
bumper cover.  Now, I just tilt my license plate up on a spring hinge, 
insert the hitch, and voila, instant 928 tow-vehicle.  (I used it mostly 
for towing my 4 x 8 race trailer and jet-ski.)
 One time, I put a bigger ball on it, rented a car-dolly from U-Haul*, 
and towed my DP 928 from Dallas to Austin (210 miles) with no problems.  
I got quite a few strange looks, seeing a "regular" looking 928 towing a 
wide-body 928 with a blower sticking out of the engine bay.
 The towing vehicle weighed 3130 lbs, DP weighed about 3500lbs + misc 
luggage/tools.  Brakes worked pretty well, considering over 100% increase 
in mass (I did have Porterfield racing pads on there).  The only thing I 
felt took a little strain was the double-disk clutch (more slipping, 
naturally, to get things going). But I saw no ill-effects in the long 
term.


 * U-Haul laughed at me when I told them what the tow vehicle was, and 
declined to rent it to me.  I came back later with a borrowed truck. ;)

Could someone please tell me where the buzzer for the ignition and gong for
the lights are located. PO seems to have removed them. Fuse panel doesn't seem
to tell me.

Thanks.
