Steve - 87S4/auto/white,

Your email address is not in your post so I could not write you directly.

Where did you find your dash cover on sale for $55? I would appreciate this
info as I need one badly. This is a very good price. Sorry to all for
using bandwidth.

TIA

Hey Leonard,
Kinda been out of touch.....Busy time of year.
How ya doing?.....Well, I hope.
Well, took my car to Ky. Motorsports yesterday, and they hooked up a digital
tach to my car. It seems my tach is accurate. Checked at idle, 1000 rpm, 2000
rpm, 3000 rpm, 4000 rpm ...... 
How can this be?....... tires, speedo, and tach all ok, yet I'm turning less
rpm at any speed in 5th than I should be.
Leads one to believe that my gearing is different, yet I can't believe it is.
I'm stumped......

>Maybe others on the list with manual-shift cars of this vintage can take a
moment >to check their tach readings at 80 mph in 5th (I get 2550, Greg gets
2300) and
>report back. 

Did anyone ever reply to this?  (cc'd list just in case) 
 
After tach check, I put car in shop to have 2" scratch fixed on the front left
fender. (don't have a clue how it got there, run-away shopping cart perhaps)
Why is it I can park my car in a parking spot far from the nearest car, and
invariably, I return to find some one has pulled up and parked right next to
me with barely enough room to open a door between?  Go figure!
Check out the tire / wheel article by Kim Crumb in this Panorama. 
Did you all see the recommendation in the newest Devek catalog, regarding
pinning the Weissach assembly if you go to extreme rubber. Didn't understand
the explanation as to why exactly.
I was thinking about the 9.5" and 11" Forgelines, till I saw that, now I may
just stick with the 9.5" front and rear as Kim had done.   
(Although he is going for maximum rubber next year on 18" rims!)
I must call and ask him if his is pinned.

Oh well...... rambling again,
Merry Holidays,
Greg S.                  87'   5spd.   Diamantblau Metallic
