     I have an 87 928 S4 with an auto. trans. and I am considering a power 
     chip to boost low end torque and improve driveability.  On a recent 
     trip to SOCAL I stopped by the DEVEK shop and inquired about power 
     chips for my car.  I was told that putting a power chip in any 928 
     with an automatic was risky.  The reason for this, I was told, is that 
     the OEM Porsche chip reduces torque at each shift interval thus 
     reducing the pressure on the trans. pump. Apparently after market 
     chips do not provide this same torque reduction feature and can lead 
     to trans. pump failure.  The gentleman at DEVEK indicated he had 
     repaired many such failures and attributed the problem to power chips.
     
     I find it difficult to believe that an after market chip manufacture 
     could not duplicate this torque reduction feature since they have the 
     Porsche OEM ship as a goby.
     
     I would be interested in any comments to the above as well as 
     information about after market chips and first hand experience as to 
     how they may improve performance with an auto. trans.
