Jason Daughenbaugh wrote of some problems he is encountering with his new
'79 928.  Mine is an '84, so my comments/suggestions may not be applicable
for his car.

If I remember correctly, the instrument panel lighting comes from two bulbs
that shine onto the *face* of the panel, not from behind.  They could be
burned out.

Been there, done that.  It's probably not the filler neck due to the shape
of the tank.  My tank developed a small split at the upper left corner
(driver side)that caused fuel to pour out when the tank was under pressure.
 Can't be patched, so I replaced it with a tank from 928 International.
Does the tank leak only when full?  Does it leak all the time?  When it
leaks, crawl under the car and see where it's coming from.  Tank
replacement is pretty easy, although the hoses can be a pain.

Could be a loose fitting.  Try loosening it and retightening.  Maybe you
need a new pump, but at least it's easy to work on :)

How do you know it's overheating if the temp guage shows normal
temperature?  What are the symptoms?  (e.g. , radiator fluid fountaining
out of the top of the radiator?)

Without seeing your car, hard to know.  Mine doesn't show a charge during
idle either, but the needle doesn't just jump up when you hit about 1500
RPM.  I had to replace my alternator when I bought the car... I waited too
long and I think the failing alternator may have fried some electronics
with high voltage (when it finally died it began overcharging
significantly). Alternators from Porsche cost about $995 last time I
checked but you can get a new one for about $250-$300 through either 928
International or one of the other suppliers.  Replacement is fairly easy,
although you need an offset wrench to get the pulley off the shaft.  Also,
the alternator is cooled via a hose that runs from the front left wheel
well.  If that hose collapsed, it would cause the alternator to overheat
and get fried.  You might want to check the hose.

You might want to have a competent mechanic check out the alternator.
Also, if the timing belt is due for repair, have that done too (and the
water pump since you have to go through the timing belt R&R in order to
service the pump).

Good luck!!
