Alignment shops:

I would NOT take your car to an independent alignment shop because there
is very few people who know how to do the job right. I took my car to
two highly recommended alignment shops and after the first one the car
felt perfect, but after three months and 10,000 miles my front tire's
were ruined. So I bought new tire's and took it to another highly
recommended place and the car was never quite perfect, it seemed to
wander After 95mph and after another month went by I noticed uneven tire
wear again. So after wasting allot of time and money I ended going to
the dealer and paying twice as much but at least it was done right.

My Cost's for being Cheap,
1st Alignment: 85.00$ (all prices in Canadian)
Two new Bridgestone Potenza So2's installed and balance 700.00
2nd Alignment 95.00$
3rd Alignment by Porsche 240.00
plus all the time lost
Grand total:1120$ Canadian = 700.00 Dollars U.S. (a.k.a. real money)
