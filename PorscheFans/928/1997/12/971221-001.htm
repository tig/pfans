    After following this list for a fortnight or so I have decided to =
join in. I have owned my 1982 928s for about two years. The car was =
imported from Hong Kong, a chinese business man was bringing in Rolls =
Royces, Merc 380SLS and 928s. He had 6 928s to choose from. The one I =
own is a signature series. It is fully optioned but the trim is =
different, half leather with a Porsche signature stitched into the front =
headrests. There is also a vacuum gauge in the bottom half of the tacho.
    I am curious, has any one else seen one like this? How many were =
built?
        Graham Bates 928s Euro spec dark metallic grey.
