True, but a centrifugal doesn't make a lot of boost until around 3000-3500
rpm (which is about 3.5-4.0 lbs.   A Kenne Bell Lysholm supercharger makes
7.1 lbs boost at 2500 rpms as measured on a 5.0 Mustang (I have a full
article where Paxton, Vortech, Powerdyne, Kenne Bell, and Procharger are
all tested with boost, temps, etc.).

True its not a lot of temp raise, about 50 degrees F at about 6-7 psi
boost, but adding an intercooler to the pricing of the designs that we are
thinking about here will run you anywhere from a few hundred for a used one
to well over $1K for a new one.  Then we must again find placement for it
as well as plumbing it.  Most 6 psi models don't really need the
intercooler in most conditions.  One of the big things for the
Mustang/Camaro crowd to do in helping to prevent detonation is to remove
base timing or put in a timing retard.  This would help when using 91-93
octane gas on the 10:1 compression motors.
