Hey guys,
I can answer this one.  The 928 Performance Portfolio covers 'em all.
Probably the only book that does with magazine articles from the actual
time.  Price about $19 from Devek.

Also, another one is called Porsche 928GTS that I bought from Classic
Motorbooks.  Not a huge amount on the older cars, but it has info and stats
on them all, as well as a few pics, but plenty of stuff on the GTS.  About
$14 from them.  They also have the Performance Portfolio.  Their number is
1-800-826-6600.  I've made lots of orders with them and they're pretty
good.  Free catalogs and everything.  I don't have the current one in my
hand, but if you need to book # to order from them, I'll dig it out for you.
