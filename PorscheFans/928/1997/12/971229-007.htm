Brian,

Rain X really works and you don't have to worry about removing it.  Like =
wax, it wears off by itself after a few weeks of driving and takes just =
a minute to re-apply.  You'll probably get a bunch of different =
suggestions about wax.  Seems like everyone has a favorite. =20

A close friend of mine runs a car detailing business and she's done all =
my cars for the past six years.  She thinks Zymol is overrated, =
especially for the price.  She uses MeGuiar's paste wax, and  it lasts =
at least a couple of months.  Thats pretty good  In south Florida where =
we have lots of rain and periods of intense heat.

Its' been so long since I've tried to use the special windshield cleaner =
that I don't even know it it works although my mechanic says that it =
does.  I think he has a tendency to romance the truth from time to time =
on details that he doesn't deem important.  Anyway, the Rain X pretty =
much obviates the necessity for it.
