Ok!!! I am being a trifle neurotic!!!  Somebody was kind enough to leave =
a
couple of door dings on my shark and it just is buggin' the $%# out of me=
=2E =

In the SF Bay area, preferrably the East bay,  who has dealt with a good
door ding removal company?  I've heard dent pro's and the like but the
better I know my car,  the more I demand someone with experience in Shark=

anatomy.  I know I am not the only anal retentive owner out there.  Any
referrals would be greatly appreciated.    James..,  I am happy to hear y=
ou
got your GTS safe and sound and did not suffer the shipping indignities
some other owners have dealt with.  Put a picture on your web site so we
could see it.     Last but not least,  I had started to have a warm start=

problem with my car where in the morning the car would fire up fine but a=

couple of hours later,  you would need to prime the gas with a couple of
pumps to the accelerator before it would start.  Turned out to be a weak
fuel pump.  Old pump had 27 pounds,  new pump has 34 pounds and now  the
car fires right up all the time.   That annoying buzz that I was hearing
from the rear of the car is gone as well.  Thanks to all of you who sent =
me
suggestions on the problem.  I hope The Hot start, warm start, cold start=

problems and solutions get to a FAQ real soon so that other will benefit
from the knowledge of the experts on this list.   Hope everyone had a Mer=
ry
Christmas!!  My 9 month old called up DEVEK and ordered me new floor mats=

for my car.  Is this the best daughter in the world or what??? I am reall=
y
enjoying the  massive power.., This car is amazing!!!  The smile is now
permanent. ( As soon as I get the dings fixed)  p.s.  Did you guys know
that when the car is washed and waxed it runs smoother and faster?  ;-)
