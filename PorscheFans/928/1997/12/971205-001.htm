Sounds like a worthy cause. It's always cool to
knock the traditional speed demons off their
pedestal with a  unique stick. I was a big Z car
modifier, and *loved* racing Porsches and 'Vettes,
as it was fun to beat them with something other
than a traditional sports car. I now realize that
bikes kick everything's ass. That's why I got the
928, to have a cushy sports car, and focus on 2
wheeled speed modifications. As far as achieving
your goal, the cheapest way to achieve that 500bhp
figure would be nitrous oxide. It's not a
permanent power boost, but works for "The Silver
State Classic", or other high speed challenges.
The nice part about nitrous is that you don't need
to do a massive amount of engine modifications.
I'd suggest new pistons, as you should run a lower
compression ratio, and a high temp coating would
be a recommended addition. Beyond a free-flowing
exhaust, I'd say you'd be set to top 200MPH. If
you want all-time HP, I'd say turbos are the way
to go. They are costlier, and require a lot more
engine modifications. Nitrous maintains your car's
stock driveability for the times you're not racing
it. Anyhow, good luck with your mission!
