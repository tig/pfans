A Christmas Tale...HO HO HO

 Not long ago and not far away Santa was getting ready for his annual
 trip...but there were problems every where...four of the  elves got
 sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the
 regular ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being
 behind schedule....then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming
 to  visit...this stressed Santa even more...when he went to harness
 the reindeer he found that three of them were about to give birth  and
 two had jumped the fence and were out heaven knows where...more
 stress.

 And then, when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards on the
 sleigh cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered all
 the toys...so, frustrated Santa went into the house for a cup of
 coffee and a shot of whiskey...but he found that the elves had hit the
 liquor cupboard and there was nothing there to drink...and in his
 frustration he dropped the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of
 little pieces all over the kitchen floor...he went to get the broom
 and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from.

 Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the
 door...he opened the door and there was a little angel with a great
 big Christmas tree.
 And the angel said:  Santa, where would you like to put this
 Christmas tree??

 And that, my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of
 the Christmas tree....
