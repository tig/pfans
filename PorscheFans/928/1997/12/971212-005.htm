Hi everyone,

I can't comment on the R22 but there is a five dollar per pound freon
replacement for R-12 that is available.  BTW, R-12 is up to about $50.00
per pound these days.

Happy holidays,

Hi All,

I've been noticing the interest over blowers the past few days and have a few
thoughts to add. I'm not trying to dampen anyones enthusiasm but I don't think
it as simple as bolt on and go.

1. Centrifugal blowers heat the air quite a bit, although not as much as a
roots type. It will have to have rather low boost if not intercooled, or some
other anti-detonation method used with 10+ : 1 compression. 5 psi boost should
be ok non-intercooled but the power gain would hardly be worth the effort.
Someone mentioned 20% - 25% and that is doing good at 5 psi non - intercooled.
5 psi air at ambient + 200 deg. F. isn't  dense enough to cause a very great
power increase. Lower compression engines, in the 9 or 9.5 : 1 compression
range could probably go to 7 or maybe 8 psi safely and start to see some good
power gain.

2. Engine driven centrifugal blowers can have very peaky horsepower curves. I
believe the boost/RPM curve of a centrifugal blower rises as the square of the
RPM (theoretical). In other words, if you have 5 psi at 6000, expect 1.25 psi
at 3000. In practice it isn't quite that bad but similar. Various things have
been tried to help this situation; variable speed drives, blow-off valves,
variable intake restrictions, etc. This characteristic is masked by a turbo
charger since the turbo RPM is not related to engine RPM.

I used to have a '57 TBird that I put a Latham blower on (in the mid 1960's).
The Latham was an axial flow compressor very similar to the compressor on a
turbo jet engine. It was about 7" in diameter and 13" long and fit neatly in
the valley between the cylinder banks.  Air entered the front and exited  the
rear with one outlet on either side feeding each cylinder bank. It didn't
raise the air temp much, nor did it take a lot of power to drive. It put out
about 8 psi from about 3000 on up to the old Ford 312's max of around 5500.
Compression ratio was 9.7:1. If anyone knows of a Latham blower available, buy
it. I do not think they are made anymore. I have put turbos on a couple other
cars I have had but I think it would be very difficult on the 928 due to lack
of room.

Has anyone thought about Nitrous Oxide? I think it has some advantages for the
928.

1. Nitrous works well on 10+ compression engines. When the oxygen is released,
the excess nitrogen seems to act like an anti detonant, and the cooling of the
evaporating nitrous further retards the onset of detonation.

2. The system is light weight and doesn't take much room in the engine bay.
You don't have to work out a drive system or intake plumbing. You do have to
find a place for the NOS bottle.

3. The system can be designed for a desired power increase and that amout of
power will be available instantly throughout the RPM range. In other words, if
you have a 150 hp nitrous system, you'll get 150 extra hp from whenever you
turn it on until you turn it off. The hp increase is not RPM dependent. The
torque/horsepower curve remains the same - just more of it.

4. A nitrous system will get 125 - 150 extra hp safely on a 928 without any
other engine mods. The stock computer chip is preferred since the ignition
timing will still be in the range to work ok with nitrous. If an after market
chip is installed, the timing may have to be retarded slightly when on the
nitrous. The driveability of the car is not affected by the nitrous system.

5. Hp gained for dollar spent, nitrous is by far the cheapest way to go. I
think you can get  100 -150 hp gain system for less than US $1000.

6. Of course the big downside is where to get the nitrous, and the hassle of
filling the bottle. It is recommended to get a large (60 lb.) bottle and fill
the small bottle you use in the car yourself. I believe that Nitrous usege
rate is about .5 lb. nitrous per 100 hp gain per minute of use. A 12 lb.
bottle would then last about 16 minutes with a 150 hp system. That's a lot of
15 sec. blasts!

I have not put a nitrous system on any car so this information is not from
experience but is from reading a lot about nitrous and talking to some
suppliers of NOS systems.

You can give NOS a call at 714-821-0592 or see their web site at
nosnitrous.com. They have nitrous systems for the 928. I requested more
information from them but have not received it yet.

I think a nitrous system on a 928 could be a real giggle. ;o)

Sorry, I realize this post got a bit long. Once started it was hard to quit.
