At a Diablo PCA tech session on CA emissions held April 12, 1997 at
Kahler's Porsche/Mercedes/BMW, 6117 Dougherty Rd, Bublin, CA
510/829-2050 I saw Denny Kahler's tripple rack tripple deck version
(holds 9 cars) which he uses out in back of his shop for car storage.
Why not give Denny Kahler a call and ask him about the system he uses.
I realize this might be a little large for your purposes, but just think
of all the additional space you would have for expanding your
collection....

intriguing.

Be sure to get references.  A Porsche mechanic I use (Valhalla in
Lafayette, CA) was very uncomplimentary about one of his lifts which
needed repairs and the manufacturer was less than cooperative.

Hi!

I have a question---can anyone tell me what the gauge does that is part of the
tachometer on my 81 S?  It is a little sweep-type gauge that has 6, 12, and 18
on it, with 1/100KM underneath.  It seems to increase with the rpms, but I
cant really understand it's function.  It doesn't really seem to make any
sense.  
Also, can anyone help me out with european repair manual info regarding the
adjustable headlamps.  I found a broken vacuum hose at the switch, but they
still dont work.  It would be kind of neat if they did.  Any advice will be
greatly appreciated!  Thank you!
