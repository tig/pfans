Those low-lifes!  I hope they get caught and spend some quality time in
a jail...

Please post your car description & numbers so the ever-widening reach of
the web can help locate your car.  Feel free to post same to my
guestbook so those not on the list can see the info.

And please don't let this deter you from ownership - how about getting
an even nicer example (with additional anti-theft measures) as the last
laugh?

Yes, there is no sure fire way to prevent a stolen car but there's no
sense making it any easier for the preps either.  Hidden momentary
switches, fuel and battery cut-offs, even removable steering wheels if
you're so inclined all add a degree of difficulty to the task and
increase the odds your car will still be there when you come back.

Sorry to hear about the loss of the car.  For the rest of us, the horses
are still in the barn so let's check those locks...
