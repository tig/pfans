My impression is a little different. I would have said that the Weissach
axle with wide tires overcompensates for trailing throttle or braking
oversteer, since it was designed with narrower tires in mind. This is
the opposite of what Paul H. suggested a day or two ago. Mind you,
I'm still unclear as to what that weird control arm actually does when
under duress.

Yes....a mystery indeed....I'm still open to suggestions or input from you
guys.

I'll quote the Devek catalog for those who don't have it.........
"The Weissach rear, which  provides toe in and toe out, works really well for
narrow tires, where a small amount of toe in or toe out results in small tire
contact patch displacements. However, the same changes in toe in / out, when
conveyed to the road through a wide tire, produce large lateral force changes
and a loss of predictability and control in the dynamic racetrack or high-
performance driving environment for which the wide tires are chosen."

de-Weissachization?   :)     
Lucky Ekman mentioned at the "frenzy" that he had "pinned" his car....
(I believe he was talking about Fat Albert, which has 335's on the rear)
Phil Tong may be able to shed some light on this subject.
Did they "pin" the GT Phil?

Yes ....Me!......can you believe it? 
We don't need no stinking de-Weissachization!
