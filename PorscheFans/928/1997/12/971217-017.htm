Hi all,

Tell me what you think...

I'm evaluating to buy a '84 928S.  It's Black/Tan
leather. 5 speed.  Original condition.  Motor has been
replaced w/ original type.  Tires are Yokahama's with
good tread.  Condition is good.  Interior shows wear,
but is not shabby. 

Here are the problems that I have seen:
        Heater control valves are broken (both)
        Temerature guage not operating
        Hood and hatch don't stay up by themselves
        Some air dam damage (front)
        Paint starting to fade and some panels
          have been resprayed
        Remote release for rear hatch doesn't work
        Leather panels in hatch area pulling away from
          body
        Hood misallignment
        Some interior lights don't come on with door.

Please send responses to me personally, as I need to
move on this quickly.

Thanks,
Dave Ladd - david@Virginia.EDU
