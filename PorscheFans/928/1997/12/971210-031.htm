Hmmm. There is a bolt through the outer (furthest from the body) part
of the link and the lower control arm. That holds them together. The
link has flex built into it, which is (a) key to the Weissach effect.
To remove the effect, you'd need a pin through the inner part of
the link and the control arm. I assume you don't have that (but we
know the saying about assumptions). Even the pictures in Project 928
show the bolt that holds the link and the arm together, so that
hasn't changed.

Still waiting for those "suspension-cam" videos...
