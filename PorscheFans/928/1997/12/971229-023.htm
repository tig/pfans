A follow-up question on the oil change thread.  I know that Jiffy Lube, et
al. tout a 3,000 mi. or 3 mos. change interval.  I understand the 3,000 
miles, but am confused by a change every 3 months regardless of
mileage.  My S4 is a weekend driver/garage queen (I know, I know) and
It usually takes me six mos. to reach 3,000 miles.  Should I be changing
the oil every 3 mos regardless of miles or can I wait for 3,000 miles.  I
currently use Mobil 1 15W-50.  Should I switch to Red Line?  Where is it
sold?  Also, is it worth switching to synthetic in my 85 Nissan Maxima
with 128,000 on the clock or is that just asking for leaks?  

Happy 199[2]8!

I recently purchased a 86 928S with only 37K and the exterior is beautiful
(guards); the interior is a bit disappointing for such a low miles car- I have
no idea what happened to the floor (we're talking under the carpeting), but
it's very chipped and warn looking. Could water damage have done this? Has
anyone had a somilar problem or insight to fixing it- I'd like to restore it
and will probably go to a interior or body specialist in the Northern Ohio
area.
Also, the car came without a spare, which I found ($35 from a junkyard!), but
I need a jack. Is there a special type? I'm afraid fix-it-flat might not work
on those 255's in back.
