As I posted several weeks, I am moving and purchasing new wheels, so I'm   
kinda forced to sell the 928. After several posts here and other places,   
no bites. Yesterday I went to see what kind of trade-in I could expect   
for the Porsche and was offered $5,500. Personally, I consider that an   
insult. Needless to say I did not accept. I would rather take a loss and   
sell it to someone who appreciates the car as opposed to giving it to a   
dealer who will turn around and sell it for $10 - 11k.

This car is a nice, not perfect, 84S, 82k, red w/ black leather, A/C,   
auto, power seats, windows and mirrors, no sunroof, gold manhole covers,   
bra and mirror bras, and Porsche Crest deck mat. All recent service done,   
water pump and timing belt within past 25k, steel ball joints, new   
radiator, new starter, all new belts, new A/C hoses. Runs great.

I will seriously consider any reasonable offers. Please email me at   
chipr@pennwell.com with your phone number or any questions and I will   
gladly give you a call to discuss. Thanks!
