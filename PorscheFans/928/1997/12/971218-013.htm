In general, we have observed that GTSs do consume more oil.  Our '93
goes through a quart about every 750 miles, and have heard of some that
have been even worse than that.  Marc has theories about the design of
the piston causing the high consumption, and Porsche's response has been
that the consumption is "within specifications".

David, if your friend is only consuming 1 quart every 1500 miles, he is
a very lucky GTS owner!  We have been running Mobil 1 15-15...maybe we
will try the non-synthetic idea.  Our GTS has over 90,000 miles on it,
so if the rings aren't seated by now....

<<With full respect to Brian and his suggestions, I take a more conservative
view and recommend that you have the same brand and model of tire on all
four wheels (the sizes will, of course, be different front to rear). This
is most important if you're cornering at or near the limit of adhesion,
where you explore the details of the way in which the tire breaks away.>>

I agree with that advice.  But it is merely something to take into account
when deciding whether or not to match all 4 corners.  I don't think of it as a
rule to follow

I have explored the limits of adhesion, and do so regularly.  The Conti's are
very progressive, and the Dunlops are as well.  At least  the 4000's were.  I
haven't mounted the SP 8000's yet.  I don't have problems with the mismatched
brands/models.  I would clearly prefer to have all 4 be the same.  As
evidenced by my current matched set.

The reason they weren't a few months back is because there were still 6K miles
left in the Dunlops on the back when the front had to be changed over to the
Conti's.  When running mismatched, I only run pairs front to rear.  I would
never suggest to anyone that you can mismatch side to side, or a single and
three.  Bad idea.  

I have a lot of experience with mismatches on many types of cars, mostly
BMW's, but also the older and newer 928's.  On the 3 series BMW's (both 320's
and 325's) it was dangerous even running pairs front to rear:  the suspension
would react funny, and cause the car to wander or float in many situations.
On the 5 and 6 series BMW's it was never as noticeable, but could be felt at
the limits and when sudden inputs to the suspension occured: swerving to
change lanes.  On the 928's I haven't had any negative feedback from the
suspension or the tires themselves so far.  Maybe I've been lucky on the
brands I'm running.

If you have many miles left in one pair, think about keeping them until you
have to change them out.  At that point you can move over to a matched set.  I
plan on moving back to the Dunlops as a matched set when the fronts are ready
to go.  That is, if I like the 8000's. Otherwise, who knows?  Think about it
carefully, but don't think of running matched all the way around as a rule.
