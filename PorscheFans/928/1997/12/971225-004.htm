(I just can't get enough of this list!)

I believe Porsche was the first auto manufacturer to offer dual airbags
in all it's cars beginning MY 1990.  Though where to find safety stats I
have no idea - maybe NHTSA.COM if they have a website? (doubtful)

IEA I feel pretty safe in such a big and capable car.  Being shorter in
stature and sitting closer to the wheel than most, I do not feel safer
having an explosive bag right in front of me though, especially one that
is not adjustable in any way for *me*.  I always wear my belts, even
before the advent of the shoulder strap and buzzers and all that crap. 
Back in the 70's, one look at a friend's collapsed chest after his
accident told me all I needed to know about not wearing seatbelts.
(Although I do remember as kid jumping up and down in the back seat and
playing on the rear shelf of Dad's StarChief doing 75 down the then
uncrowded freeways, neener neener neener, what an innocent time!).

Isn't there a bill pending so that certain owners upon submitting
requisite proof (must operate vehicle closer than 10" to wheel/bar,
etc.) can now have their airbags disabled?  Now, I sit further away than
that but if the wheel were to be adjusted per classic racing style (back
fully flush with seat back, arms outstretched, wheel to lay directly
under wrists with hands at 12 o'clock position) then I suspect
everyone's wheel would be closer than they'd feel comfortable with.

I've read on other lists that removing the airbag hasn't proven to
increase injury with belted female occupants, while removing airbags
slightly raised the occurance of injury to belted male occupants.  I
don't know all the metrics behind those stats but have removed the
driver's airbag off my Miata to install a sport wheel.  I'll be
installing a true rollbar as well and maybe coupled with better steering
response it is as safe or safer than with an airbag alone?  

I plan on doing the same with the GT (wheel and rollbar), although I
will leave the passenger airbag in place.  My ulterior motive is to
install a dished wheel to get it closer to me without affecting pedal
distance, and hopefully find a dished and flat bottom wheel to get some
additional knee room.  Not likely but who knows.  I know of at least one
person that uses racing harnesses full-time street or track - what good
would an airbag do in those cases (yes I know belts stretch but 3"
racing harnesses must have less give wouldn't they?).

Questions that need answers...

Good thread!

Merry 928 Christmas all  :)
