Jesse Rojas asked about installing a rear wheel bearing -

Jesse,

First, if your problem is bearing noise, check that the axle nut is
tight. The rear wheel bearings are two-row radial-thrust ball bearings,
and if the nut is loose, you will get bearing noise. The torque on that
puppy is 322 foot pounds! That is 80 pounds on a four foot handle!

This bearing replacement method worked for me - YMMV.
Put the new bearing (which should cost about $75 if you get a discount)
in the freezer. Loosen the axle nut. Remove the half shaft (axle).
Remove the caliper - don't take the hose off, just hang it on the
suspension. Take the brake disk off. Remove the parking brakes, and pull
the cable out. On ABS cars, remove the sensor. Remove the upright (hub
carrier) by removing one top bolt & partially removing the large bottom
bolt. The shock holds the spring - no compressor needed.
Clean everything very well. Drive the hub from the upright. This will
destroy the wheel bearing. I had to cut the inner race off the hub with
a die grinder - the book says to press it off. Don't scar the hub! Put
the hub in the freezer. Remove the parking brake backing plate and the
snap ring.
Put the upright in the oven at 300 degrees (per the shop manual) or at
200 degrees (worked for me). Carefully (very!) drive the bearing from
the upright. Slip the (cold) new bearing in place. Make sure that it
goes all the way in - mine just fell in, but I had really chilled the
bearing by using dry ice. 
Reinstall the snap ring, and be sure (very!) to put the parking brake
backing plate back on. The bearing should now be pretty warm from the
upright heat, and the hub should be pretty cold. Be sure that you have
the snap ring and the parking brake backing plate in place, and drive
the hub in place, supporting the inner race as you do this.
Reinstall everthing, being careful to get the parking brake retaining
springs hooked over the edge of the holes.
Torque the axle nut to 322 ft/lbs. I removed the small center cover from
my wheel, and torqued it with the wheel on the ground - having someone
hold the brakes is probably required. I don't know whether the parking
pawl in the transmission would stand that kind of load or not.
Good luck!
