Hello all,

I am a new subscriber to this group, but not a new Porsche owner.  I have a
couple of questions regarding my desire (and my wifes dispair) to purchase
a 928.

My question involves the maintenance issue.  I realize that the vast
majority of Porsche owners can afford to take their cars into a mechanic
for the major services.  Through my life I have not had that luxury.  I
have expensive tastes in cars, and if I can't do all the required repairs,
I can't own them.  Besides, I just enjoy working on them.  

Has anyone done there own major services?  Timing belt changes, water
pumps, engine/tranny rebuilds?  I have a well stocked heated garage and
have tons of mechanical experience.  Hell, in just one year my 1982 924 has
gone from a well handleing _underpowered_ car, to a fire breathing, corner
carving, 944 thrasher from hell.  I have installes suspension upgrades,
Weber side draft carbs, cam, exhaust and much more.  

I am not planning on "hotrodding" the 928 (the 924 just desperatly needed
it), but I can not afford a pristine example of a 928.  I am looking at the
used car lot version of the 1978 - 82 models.  I realize that the first few
months I will be rebuilding electrical switches and getting alot of
"nick-nac" ittems repaird.  But are major services beyond the grasp of a
good "shade tree" mechanic on this car?

Thanks for the bandwith
