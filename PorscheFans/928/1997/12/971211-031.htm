Its not really that bad.  A regular supercharger at about 6 psi on an
otherwise stock 302 Mustang motor does increase power by about 40%, but
about 35-50 HP of that is used for turning the supercharger itself.  At 6
psi, most fuel systems can handle this upgrade pretty well, with a fuel
pressure regulator in some cases.  A 928 might need a bit more fuel pumping
in there, though.

Actually, the Powerdyne supercharger uses a belt driven compressor and in
reliable for 100K miles before replacing the belt (which is stronger than
the impeller blade in their tests!) and the plumbing would require zero
work, especially if no intercooler is there.

Also, when any other upgrades are made to your car (i.e. exhaust, intake,
etc.), this will make the supercharger boost even more effective.

They are a great upgrade without having to tear into your motor. I did lots
of research into them because I was balanced between one and a trip to Skip
Barber racing school.  I chose racing school instead.
