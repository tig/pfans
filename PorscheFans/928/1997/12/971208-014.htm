>scenes in any movies.

Risky Business and Wierd Science are the only two I know of. 

I like the scene in Risky Business where the garage door opens, the mood
music starts the headlights come on, the car starts and revs a few times.
Then the car stalls when he dumps the clutch and the music stops abruptly
followed by the sound of the starter. Then the music starts again as he
(Tom Cruise character) pulls out of the garage. I also cringe every time I
see that poor 928 go swimming in Lake Michigan. Psychedelic velour and all.
When did that movie come out,'78 or '79?

Anybody know of any dramatic (not comedy) movies that feature Land Sharks
(two words or one...hmmm?) in compromising positions.

Back on subject. Has anybody ever changed a valve housing gasket while the
motor is in the car. I have read the recent posts on doing the oil pan
gasket and think I can handle that. If I can do the right side valve
housing I won't need to pull the motor. My winter projects in the engine
compartment are to stop all the small oil leaks and to get the clutch out
to inspect and to replace whatever is needed. The motor runs strong and
smooth, I just can't stand nuisance oil dripping.

Would it be easier to just yank the motor?

Apostrophe corrections expected.
