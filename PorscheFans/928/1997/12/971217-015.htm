Great comments, Gene!

I love the look of the Viper. To me, it's like an overgrown American =
Lotus Seven.   =20
I would love to have one in my garage.  There lies the subtle =
difference.  I love the
928 when it's NOT in my garage, but safely under my butt with an =
interesting stretch
of road visible ahead of me.
