Leonard, You just won yourself the crazy comment of the day.

Your point about pressure and density is accurate in your demonstration.
The whole phenomena can be link to the ideal gas law PV = nRT
Where P is the pressure, V = Volume, n = number of moles R the ideal
gas constant and T is the temperature (ablsolute none the less).

We must remember that an intercooler is not necessary for a turbo to
operate.  There are a lot of turbocharged car that do not have them.
Some Porsche have an intercooler that is deemed too small.

The reason we pump air into our engine is to increase the quantity of
oxigen we have present for combustion (also why nitrous works).  By
pumping air into the cylinder, you can put more fuel and get a bigger
bang.  This result in more power.  The problem is that pumping the
air warms it up.  This increase its "volume" thus reducing its density.
However, if your are pumping fast enough, you still get a gain but
the pressure will be high and lots of energy will be lost in the 
pumping.  To be more effective, we opt to cool the gas after it is
pumped.  Following the gas law, the volume of air that was pump now
"shrinks" and, in effect, becomes more dense (same weight of air but
in a lesser volume).  This is now ready to be introduced in the 
engine.

It all comes down to one thing.  You can only put a predetermined
volume of gas in the cylinder.  If you are able to make this volume
bigger (start booring your engine or increasing stroke) or make
the volume contain more oxygen (pressurize, cool or add a gas that
contain oxygen by volume then air).

So will you get improved performance with a supercharger: yes
would it be better with an intercooler: yes

Will the engine survive any of these modification?  Only if it is done
right...
