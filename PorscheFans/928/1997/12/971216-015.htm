I don't think the regulator works 'against' the pump.  I believe that the 
regulator bleeds off excess fuel in order to maintain pressure-- so, in 
essence, it works "with" the pump.

I have removed the fuel-dampener on one of my 928s, leaving only a single 
regulator.  The only effect I saw was an increase in audible noise.  So, 
my theory is that the dampeners do two things: 1) smooth out 
*high-frequency* (fuel-pump sourced) pulsations, and 2), provide 
additional regulation for the injectors. There may be other more subtle 
purposes of the dampener, but this is all I have observed.
