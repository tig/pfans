Hi Rich,

I'm part way towards a solution on the fast hot idle problem.  Here's what
I've done:

o  inspected aux air valve.  Works OK. 
   Some broken porcelain (spelling?) pieces that came out when I shook it.
o  inspected distributor and vac advance.  Works OK.
   Put 3-in-1 oil (3 drops) on felt pad 
o  inspected and tightened multiple hoses and fittings.  No obvious
improvement.
o  ran fuel injector cleaner thru two tanks of gas.  
o  replaced hoses from vac valve on passenger side of throttle body 
   (forgot what the valve is called.  Both hoses were loose.  
    No obvious improvement).
o  broke and replaced a bunch of those small, hard vac. lines.  Damn!  

The engine no longer hangs at 1200 RPM.  If I'm driving along and let up on
the gas (and clutch too), the RPMs will go immediately to 700 RPM (where
they belong), then bounce to about 1,000 RPM and then over about 10 seconds
it'll settle down to 700 RPM again.

Only thing I have yet to check is the O2 sensor.  A mechanic I spoke with
suggested I wait until I'm experiencing the problem and then disconnect the
O2 wire in the relay compartment under the passenger footwell (it's a big
green wire).

As long as the speed settles back to 700 I'm not in such a hurry to find
the problem.  If it persists, I'll probably take the car to my mechanic
next time I go out of town on business and let him play with it for a week.

Now to your question about tracks in LA -- don't know anything about this
as I don't plan to race my old lady (the car, not the wife).  At 172K miles
and no engine rebuild (that I know of) I don't want to stress her too much
(and those synchros in first and second are fine for motoring around town,
but not for a track).
