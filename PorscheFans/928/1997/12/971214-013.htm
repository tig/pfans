Last summer I needed to recharge mey a/c with R-12. I checked into
prices and found it was time to find an alternate gas for the job. I got
on the net and checked out some and finally found the EPA page on
refrig. gases and looked for the one that i thought would be around a
while, do a good job, be reasonably priced, and work in my system with
no mods to the system, and not blow up at the first spark it saw.

I found one called "Freez it" and sent off for some information, curves,
and test data. It turns out it's distributed in Dallas so I called them
and spoke with the local office. I spoke with one lady who said she had
it in her car for over 2 years and no problems at all.I ask about system
failures and she said most of them were caused by over pressurization.
As it turns out, it follows R-12 very closly, about 5 psi lower in
pressure for the same temp.

I closed my eyes, and had some put in. I checked the duct outlet temp
and it read 45 f., and the outside temp was about 90 f. Not bad if
everything holds. Well it seems to have held, it hasn't blown up so far,
and in general seems to have done a good job this past summer. I think I
will check it again before I start using it next summer to be sure the
compressor pressures are with in or below spec. for the ambiant temp at
test time.

They advertise it is compatable with F-12  components et.al., so if it
doesn't work, I try flushing it and going back to F12. I have no plans
to try F-134. 

This whole thing about F 12, and cfc's, etc.I think was generated by Du
Pont because their patent ran out and that would have ment others could
have manufactured F-12 and cut the price. Oh well, it doesn't matter
now. The hue-and-cry to save the planet because CFC's are effecting the
ozone layer doesn't apply to anyone outside the U.S.A., so I guess its
all our fault. I'd like to put their buns in a car in L.B.J. traffic in
July OR August and see how fast they could find a reason to make F-12
available again.

Enough sex and motherhood for this session. If any one else has had any
experience with FREEZ It I'd like to hear about it, I think.

So many cars, so little time to enjoy them!
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.
