Tom,

I do not see an answer to your questions so I will take a guess.  I
am presently putting an engine back in a 944 Turbo and the moror
mount are located on the crossmember.  If you want to remove the
crossmember on your car, you will first need to support the
engine from the top.  If not, the engine will drop right through.

The 1 or 2 inch he can raise the engine probably comes from extending
the motormount.

Hope I am right and that answer your question.
