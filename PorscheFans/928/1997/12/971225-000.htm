Hello fellow "LAnd Shark" tamers:

Recently, one of you posted a question on how to repair a leaking sunroof. I
wrote a piece on the subject back in November. The following is a reposting
of that piece.

A recent edition of "Motorweek" had Pat Goss showing how to fix leaking
sunroofs. My sunroof leaked occasionally, so I decided to try his advice. 

He stated that it is normal for the seals to allow moisture to seep through,
but the four drains must be clear to allow that moisture to escape. The
problem is usually that the drains are plugged which causes water to back-up
and overflow into the cabin. He recommends the use of air pressure (no more
than 15 psi) to clear out any obstructions in the drain(s). Also, the use of
wire or excessive aip pressure may cause the tubing (if any) to seperate
from the drain holes. 

After applying the recommended amount of air pressure, the obstruction still
did not clear. I decided to use something thin, strong, manuverable and that
could be turned while in the drain. In my case the obstruction was over a
meter down the drain, so I needed something rather long as well. It turns
out that rear-brake "cable" from a bicycle works very nicely. After a few
minutes of "Roto-rooter" work the obstruction cleared and a spash of grit
and water poured onto my garage floor. 

If your sunroof leaks, before you replace the seals, inspect the drain
plugs. Good luck and happy/dry motoring. Ed
