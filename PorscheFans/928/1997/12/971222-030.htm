Right....I knew what I *meant*, too bad I didn't say it!

(2) and (3) is why you still have to change your oil (eventually) even
though
the oil hasn't been broken down by heat, shear forces, etc.

Here's one on overheating (87S4).....

Car would occasionally overheat after sitting around for a week to ten days.
Shut off car, wait for it to cool down and restart...everything A-OK.
Possible stuck thermostat, maybe?  Replace with new, lower temp
unit....problem solved.

Over time, problem comes back.  Can't be another bad thermostat, right?  Could
it be stuck cooling air flaps???  Jeez, they work as advertised....with car
off they are open (fail-safe position), and then they close when ignition is
turned on.  Drive motor obviously works.  Replace thermostat again!!!

Arrgh!!!, problem comes back like a bad penny.  This time disconnect flap
motor power (large black rubber, cylindrical connector near hood release).
Turn ignition on, flaps stay open (obviously).  Let's see if problem
continues.  OK for a couple of weeks, then overheats again!!!  Turn car off,
wait a few moments, turn ignition back on, fans running....so what's the
deal?!?!?!?  Another bad/stuck thermostat....can't be!!!  Bring car to
dealership for AC system work (October)...overheats as I get there.  Dealer
says no cooling system problem found, should be OK.

Later in the fall (November), need to bring car to dealership to have brake
fluid changed.  On the way to dealership (15 miles), the car overheats and
light comes on as I pull into lot.  Don't even bother having dealer look at it
again.  After getting car back from dealer, decide that since cooling flaps
obviously not causing the problem (disconnected, remember?), might as well
reconnect them.   What?!?!?  Dealer reconnected them when AC system was
serviced back in October!  Back to square one, maybe they are the problem.

Disconnect them again...got to find out if they cause the problem or not.  If
no more incidents occur, then maybe that's the problem, but if one incident
does occur, well we know where not to look.  Sure enough, car overheats again.
Decide to seek professional counseling (no, not the couch people...Devek).
They say, did you ever check your radiator cap?  Well, no.  That must be it!
I have an off-the-shelf cap that my local garage installed when I had the
first thermostat replaced way back when.  It must be that!!  It must be bad!!
Order a new cap....Oh! boy!

Cap comes in, don't have time to install (don't ask), but getting very cold by
now so not using car anyway.  One day need to go on a business
appointment....wife has other car (Saab), so I take the 928.  Car OK to
appointment (20 miles).  On the way back, ambient temperature around 35F,
going about 75-80 mph on highway, everything OK.  Get off highway, stop & go 5
miles to house, temp starts climbing to maximum.  By the time I get home, car
is overheating again.  Hey, it's the cap, right?  No problem....I replace cap
and reconnect cooling flap motor power.  I'm all set now.

Next morning, got to make the same roundtrip business appointment (20 miles).
First 5 miles of stop and go, temp gets up to normal and stays
there...yippee!!!  Going 75mph down highway, slow rise in temp towards
maximum.  Pull off highway after about 10 miles of highway driving.  Wait 5
minutes, restart, temp starts coming down immediately, fans running....drive
off and get to destination (5 more highway miles) but car overheats just as I
pull into parking lot (#$@%^$!!!).  On the way home, car does same
thing...stop after 15 miles, wait a couple of minutes, restart, cools down,
make it last 5 miles home just as car overheats.

That's it...there's a gremlin in the cooling system...just put a bullet
through the radiator and kill the sucker!!!

Finally, sit down with a BIG drink and start to try and piece this puzzle
together.  No way it's another thermostat....after waiting a few minutes the
car did cool down, but the problem occurred again after driving only a few
more miles.  Before, once the temp got back to normal after an overheat
incident, it didn't reoccur for days (or longer).  Now it was happening right
away....repeatability!!!  That's good!!  Let's check those flaps again...go
out to garage, key off - flaps open, key on - flaps closed....OK.

Next day....same drive, same result.  Damn!, this is really repeatable now.
This time, check out flaps after I pull into garage just as the car overheats.
Kill motor, turn ignition on.  Woah!!  Flaps are closed with power on...they
shouldn't be with car overheating!  Turn power off...flaps open.   Power on -
flaps closed, off - flaps open.  Sitting in car, power on, thinking about
suicide...all of a sudden fans kick in, and (sure enough) flaps are open!!!
Start car and temp comes back down to normal.

OK, ok, think, think!!!  Consult service manual.  Eureka....I've got it!!!
Flaps AND fans are controlled by same unit, and various sensors and switches
can turn them on and off.  Possible intermittent coolant temp sensor???  Nope!
Failed coolant temp sensor!

Here's the scenario.  Driving down the road, failed sensor keeps flaps closed
and fans off, but since ambient is pretty cold, takes quite a few highway
miles before car overheats (slow overheat phenomenon).  Shut off motor and
wait a few minutes...restart and fans kick in and flaps open.  Why?  An air
temp switch located in the intake manifold plenum opens the flaps and turns
fans on when it hits 82C, which it does when you let car sit for a few minutes
and heat soakback causes the air temp to soar.  Start car, everything cools
down pretty fast with ambient being around 35F.  But soon as you start moving,
the cold air sucked into the plenum causes the switch to trip and close the
flaps and turn off the fans...ergo another overheat cycle.

In the summer, this problem was not noticeable since the ambient temp was a
lot hotter, causing the intake temp sensor to reach its trip setting virtually
immediately upon engine shutdown so you could hear the fans and conclude they
were operating properly.  Also, the transmission fluid temp also causes
flaps/fans to turn on...very possible during the summer.  But now, during cold
weather, the only effective flap/fan control signal is the coolant temp
sensor, and if it's bad, you have to wait a noticeable amount of time for the
intake air temp sensor to fire the flaps and fans after a shutdown.  This time
delay, of course, is the key to solving the problem because it allows you to
recognize that the fans and flaps are not working as they should.

To confirm this theory, the next time I drove the car (with the flap motor now
disconnected to prevent overheating, at least while moving), I noticed that
indeed the temp stayed low (bottom third of the band).  Once at home, I let
the car idle for a while and watched the temp start to climb towards maximum
(also expected since the fans would not be functioning with the presumed
coolant temp sensor failure).  Then I killed the motor, and then turned the
ignition back on....and waited.  According to my theory, the intake air temp
switch would soon trip and the fans would come on.  Sure enough, after about 3
minutes the fans roared to life.  Fired up the motor, watched the temp drop
and the fans shut down...all as expected.

Observed cooling system operation matches predicted behavior exactly....theory
confirmed.  Now just have to determine where the actual failure lies....the
sensor, the interconnecting wires, or the input circuit in the control unit.
But that's another story...
