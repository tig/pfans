> David - you brought up an interesting point. Why should the GTS engine burn more oil than earlier engines driven in  similar conditions? You mentioned Porsche suggests waiting 2,000 mi before using synthetic oil in a new engine. Is it too "slick" to get the rings to seat in properly? We had to use straight mineral oil and frequent high power settings for at least 25 hours before switching to synthetic oils in new recip aircraft engines. If we didn't, we could count on higher-than-normal oil cons

Del, thanks for the question/comment.  Interestingly, it was received in
my computer as one long line, not as reprinted above.  Quirk of the
system?

Anyway, as your experience suggests, the lubricant is one of the
variables.  As a non-engineer (but with lots of grease under my nails
over the years), is it possible that the real influencer is the more
precise machining techniques available today?  Or perhaps less
"cross-hatching" of the cylinder bores to reduce friction/improve
mileage?  Seems related to how well the rings seal off any blow-by.

In any event, it's interesting to see that good ol' PA crude still has a
place in the market!

Regards,
David
