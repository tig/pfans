Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

As those of you that came to the Frenzy may recall, Larry Reynolds discusse=
d
the short-comings of Zym=F6l. Basically, it's overpriced and not easy to
apply. For better results there is P-21 carnuba wax, but it too is not easy
to apply. Actually, they both require that they be removed before they dry.
This means that one does about 2 to 3 square feet at a time. However, there
are other good products out there that are not as labor intensive. Blitz
carnuba wax is vey good and does not cost nearly as much as Zym=F6l or P-21.
It can be applied on the entire car at one time if one is so inclined. One
is suppose to wait for it to dry to a haze before removal. 

As in all other good wax jobs, the key to a good shine is having a good
polished and glazed base to work with. That usually means, several levels o=
f
preparation before the good wax goes on. This takes time and energy, but th=
e
results are stunning. As a Concours judge I get to see the results of the
participents labor. I have seen many show cars that used a wax made with
polymers and or silicone. On their own, they look fine. But they don't
compare to a show car that has been well prepared and has a carnuba wax
finish. Just like most things in life, "you get what you pay for". Also,
plenty of elbow grease does have it's rewards.

If you are trying to get a stunning shine with the least amount of cost and
effort you are asking for too much. If it sounds to good to be true, it
usually is. Since you decided to buy the best GT ever made, you should
consider that it should be cared for in as such. Don't try to cheap your wa=
y
with an exotic. If you think you can, try competing against the show car
crowd. You will likely be humbled. If you can't give the 928 the attention
it deserves, sell to someone who will, and get a something that no one will
care if it looks good or not.

Happy motoring and new year. Ed
