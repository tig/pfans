Serge,

Re: calibrating gas gauges.  I've had a whole gang of 928s and can't =
recall a single one that had an accurate gauge.  I know almost to the =
mile how far my 87S4 will go on a tankfull either on a trip or around =
town, and just reset the trip meter when I fill up.  I usually fill up =
at about 400 miles with mixed driving, and 450 to 500 on a trip.  One =
time just for the hell of it I decided to stretch it and see how far I =
could go.  I drove from Palm Beach to Charleston, S.C., 530 miles in =
exactly seven hours without stopping.  My low fuel light was on the last =
50 or 60 miles.  When I filled up it took 21 1/2 gallons.  That was with =
my cruise control set at 78 mph. Roughly 24.5 m.p.g.  Not too bad =
considering the speed, weight, horsepower, and the fact that the car =
hadn't been tuned for quite a few thousand miles.   Incidentally, was =
that your black 87S4 that I saw in  Igor's place when I picked my car up =
last friday?  Looked good.

Gene O'Rourke
