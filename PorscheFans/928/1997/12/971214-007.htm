Your exciting news brings up a question I've been meaning to ask: has
anyone on this list had any experience with a garage lift? You know, those
steel elevators that allow you to 'stack' cars in your garage?

They're advertised in Hemmings by the half-dozen, and they look intriguing.
Some even work under an 8' ceiling. Prices range from $2,600- 3,000.

So, anyone have any experience?

Well the Asheville Grand Opening trip has been continually delayed because of
construction delays.

I finally hear that I will be traveling there on the 20th of December
(saturday).  I will be confirming this later in the week. 

If anyone is still interested in showing up, let me know.  I will probably be
there for sat and sun, and then return to Williamsburg on monday morning.
