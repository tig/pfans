These are NOT horrendous conditions for motor oils!  Granted, it's
probably very hard on the rest of the car...

Here's a list of things that stress out motor oils:

 - high cylinder & head temp (heavy throttle, high-RPM running)
 - *starting* in extremely cold temperatures (how long do you think any
of those cabs sat cold?)
 - huge shear forces

What's the fastest you could get a taxi in NYC going?  Maybe 60mph, for
2 blocks?
These are *not* highly-stressed engines.  Transmissions...maybe. =20
