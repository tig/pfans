OK, then the Energy MXV4 (beware of prior non-Energy tires which still may
be left in someone's stock) is an excellent tire for fast sedans; you'll
find them as OEM on current big Mercedes and BMW cars, they're also doing a
great job on my old-but-strong Mercedes 450 SEL. They're not dangerous for
a 928, but they're certainly not going to give you the crisp handling of a
more sporting tire.

For the same money, you could get, for example, the Bridgestone RE71, an
excellent performance tire which was used as OEM by Porsche and is
currently used with pleasure by a number of listmembers. Go shopping at
Tire Rack's Web site (http://www.tirerack.com/).

I think you'll enjoy your car more with true performance tires, no matter
how you drive.
