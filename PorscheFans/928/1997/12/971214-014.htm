I know this thread was addressed several weeks ago, but while  rummaging
through some of my literature this weekend, I stumbled across Porsche
pub #W73-772-6061 (this is for the 1982 model year).  On page 30, the
following is written:

The starting material is sheet metal that has been hot-dip galvanized on
both sides.  While still in strip form it is immersed in a liquid zinc
bath at 932F.  The high reaction temperature causes the zinc to diffuse
into the steel, forming a close-linked iron-zinc alloy.  When the strip
is withdrawn from the bath, pure zinc is deposited on this layer in an
impermeable protective film.

Parts of the floor assembly that are subject to special danger from
water spary have a coating of .9 ounces of zinc per square foot of sheet
steel.  Together with a high-quality painting process that has proven
its worth over many years, this gives the Porsche two-fold protection
against corrosion.  The paint protects the zinc and the zinc protects
the steel.

The floor of the car, wheel housings, front skirt, and side rocker
panels are coated with PVC.  The protective undercoating and joint seals
are baked on.  In addition, protective wax is sparayed into all hollow
spaces.

A body treated in this manner will withstand corrosive forces for many
years.  If the zinc coating suffers a minor injury, so that the steel is
exposed, moisture has a "curative" effect on the damaged area.  Zinc
ions migrate to the iron and neutralize the exposed steel surface.  In
effect, the zinc allows itself to be oxidized to protect the steel.
Structural body parts are extrememly well preserved in this manner.  The
sturdy body structure of the Porsche remains intact.

During spot welding, the zinc coating is vaporized or melted in the
vicinity of the electrodes.  The zinc enclosed between the plates also
melts, forming a protective  circle around the weld nugget.

A body with this kind of protection can take a lot of punishment.  At
the Porsche plant, a 928 was sprayed for 240 hours with a 5% salt
solution at an ambient temperature of 95F.  This was repeated several
times.  Afterwards, the car was as immaculate as ever before.


The above is copied directly, as printed.   There is a large diagram on
the page detailing the layering of the metal and how damage affects the
treated areas.

Sorry for the long post, but thought it might be of interest to those
still curious about how our cars were prepared for life on the road - at
least through the 1982 model year.

Cheers to all - and may your Porsches run forever!

PS>   ........was coming home tonight after dark, and while passing an
Amoco station, saw the jaws of a pristine looking 928S, guards red,
pulling onto street and whisking in opposite direction.   Had a smile on
my face the rest of the way home.

<<Hi, I just purchased a 88 928 S4 5 Speed Silver and am interested in finding
out about 928 activities in VA.  Who is in charge of membership in the VA
Club?

Thanks for your help.

Informal meetings are all we have done so far, in addition to the Frenzy.  I
will add your name to the list of email addresses that I keep to broadcast out
if something is planned.

I am in Williamsburg, and often travel up to the DC area.  If you are ever
coming down this way, there are three 928's form the list around me.  One here
in Williamsburg, and one in Virginia Beach.  My friend in Virginia Beach
spends a lot of time around here.  Actually there are six 928's I've spotted
regularly here in Williamsburg, in a town of about 40K, not including the
surrounding communities.  I think this might be the highest per capita
anywhere.  Who knows.

Anyway, if you are ever traveling in this area let me know in advance.  I will
put your name in the file.  I will also copy this message to the others so
that you will have all the names as well

I'll keep you posted.  Expect to confirm later in the week.  Where are you,
