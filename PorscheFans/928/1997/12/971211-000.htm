Hello P-fans…

Here's a message from the 'cheesehead'. Don't worry, it didn't crosspost it
(which means CC:to different lists, as I now found out), what was what
caused this mess.
First of all I would send out a million and one apologies to all my fellow
listies, for messing up the list the last week.
Just so everybody understands, I just send ONE message ONCE. The listserver
just kept repeating the message (because of the crossposting). I can tell
you it scared the hell out of me. 
The day after I send the message, I got over 300 confirmation messages from
the listserver stating that my 'tracking cheeseheads' message had been
posted to this list. I always thought only others were stupid enough to
pull a stunt like this, well, guess again. 
To prevent any further damage, I tried to contact the listmaster
(info@porschefans.com) right away, but there wasn't anybody home over
there… so it was completely out of my hands.
As if things couldn't get worse (the Murphy law really does work after
all), for some reason the number of subscriptions to the 911 list had
reduced to only 38 a couple of days later. This really got me worried… Now
I really did it! I killed the list! I thought everybody was so p-ed off by
my repeating messages they finally gave up on the list and unsubscribed.
Was it because of me?
I'm not sure what happened, but all of a sudden I was subscribed to ALL the
P-fans lists, getting from some lists even twice the digest a day…
Meanwhile, I was getting loads of messages from fellow listies (some where
understanding, others were well…) which seriously expanded my English
vocabulary (you can guess with what type of words). I replied to each and
every one of them, trying to explain what had happened, after which they
were pretty forgiving. All together I got a whole lot more attention than I
had counted for…
Anyway, the repeating message seems to be down to once a day now, so I hope
it will disappear by it self real soon now.
Well, I hope you can all forgive me and keep talking to me in the future,
'cause I sure love this list.
I'm off now, keeping a low profile for a while to give this thing a chance
to blow over.
Please have mercy on this little cheesehead…

PS, I guess I never should have bought those powered leather sportseats
that were offered on this list a little while ago 8^)

PPS, a big thanks to Ross Parker, for sending out messages to all the
listies to resubscribe and so keeping it alive (unlike me).
