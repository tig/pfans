Brian,

That was Mark Anderson that you just commented to. Mark Anderson?
928 International? _THE_ best prices/stock for 928 parts. One of
the _best_ sources for 928 information. Of course, you must not
have known this. If Mark wants to pull a trailer with a 928, then
he is doing it because he has a point to make. He's probably 
going to begin showing up at Autocross and other track events
towing a 928 International trailer loaded with parts to sell as
well as a rolling workshop. Then, he's going to unhook the trailer
and kick everybody's butts in the event of the day. 

Mark Anderson is not looking for a U-Haul (the most obvious and
cheese-headiest solution)!

Now, say you're sorry and go to your room and don't come down till
supper!
