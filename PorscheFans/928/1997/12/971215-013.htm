Hey Mark,

What about a custom fifth wheel type setup. Put a false rear window and
some extra sheet metal in the back (ala Pantera). Anchor a hitch plate to
the rear deck over the transaxle and have yourself a 928 semi. Maybe even
dual vertical stacks with the little rain flappers. Hey, you could even
install rear tandems and some of those trick chrome naked silhouette mud
flaps on. That would turn some heads.

Almost across the street from Cracker Barrel is where we stayed, but 
I've forgotten the name of the motel now.

Next time let me know, and we will have at least three local 928's to meet
with you.  There are a couple in Richmond that might be talked into making the
trip as well.
