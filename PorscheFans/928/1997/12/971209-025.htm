	I'm no expert, but it should cost about $2500US for the blower and some
tubing, according to Paxton. I would probably set aside a weekend to do the
job, and I am going to do it at a machine shop so I can have a welder on
hand to cut and weld the tubing as necessary. I will also need someone on
hand to machine any brackets that need built. Paxton feels no reprogramming
is necessary on such a low boost setting, and they claim that at that
setting, they are far, far away from any harmful detonation. Paxton and
Supercharger of Knoxville both claim a 45% power increase on a low boost
setting of 5 PSI. Both parties claim that the supercharger setup is ultra
reliable on a *healthy* motor. This huge power increase is nothing compared
to what paxton can do on a modified engine. Their Novi supercharger pumps
out 27 PSI to racing type motors. Can you say 1000 HP, anyone?
