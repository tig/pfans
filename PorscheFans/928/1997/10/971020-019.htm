For Chris who asked about 928vs944 handling.

I bought my 928S4 to replace my 1985.5 944, which had around 105,000 miles
on it, but was in overall excellent condition.  The 944 was the second 944
that I had owned, as my ex-wife had had one in 1987, and she let me drive it
sometimes.  Here are my thoughts:

The two cars are completely different in terms of performance.  The 928 is
MUCH faster from zero to 160 miles per hour.  The 928 has twice the engine
(literally), without twice the weight.  The 928 "handles" very well,
although it is very heavy...it really likes going fast over long distances,
which is what it was designed to do.

The 944 is much quicker than the 928.  It is much lighter in feel and feels
much more athletic in tight "handling" situations.  If I was going to go
autocrossing, then I would want a 944; if I wanted to go on the Cannonball
Run, then the 928 would be the car.

One other comment is that if most of the time the car was going to be used
in traffic and around town, I would have neither:  I would have a VW Jetta
of Golf, because when it gets dinged, it hurts less, and is much, MUCH
easier to get in and out of.  The 944 has narrow door openings, and the 928
has huge doors which make climbing out in close quarters difficult:  both
cars are very low, which is a disadvantage when dodging and waving with
taxicabs and eighteen wheelers.

As far as cost of operation goes....about the same, I think.  Porsches are
just very expensive by the pound, but they generally don't fail.  It is
POSSIBLE to buy a nice 944 for around four or five grand; and decent 928 can
be had for that too, but it will be a 1978 or so, which is getting pretty
old,a nd might mean lots of  maintenance.

Did I understand EIGHTEEN years old?  My advice?  Buy the best 944 you can
find, and also buy shop manuals.  My 1985.5 944 sold this summer for $6500,
and my 24 year old son really wanted it.  I told him to wait until he can
spend more money for a much newer car, and my 944 cost ZERO over four years
and 45000 miles and was a truly excellent car.  I did not feel that it was a
good car to sell to him, simply because at that age, things (expensive
things) can fail.

Good Luck, Chris!
