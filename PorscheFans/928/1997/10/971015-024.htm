That's nice, but...

XGTV's...

....that's not. It's just not a good idea to have different models of tires
at front and rear, the more so the harder you drive the car. If you must,
it's generally regarded as better to put the stickier tires at the rear to
avoid the problem of rear-end spins due to lower traction there. I know you
want to get the full value from all your older tires, but how much is your
delicate posterior worth?

Meanwhile, if all four wheels are well and truly balanced (which is not a
simple thing to do well enough to get good results at 928 speeds; your
friendly local generic tire store probably won't), you need to look at
wheel bearings and steering linkage (although your lack of vibration
through the wheel suggests otherwise).

First get ready, then go zoom.
