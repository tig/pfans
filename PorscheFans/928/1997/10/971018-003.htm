I forgot who was asking but the question "are the '89 f-fenders
different than the '90 model", or for that matter, what are the fender
differences among model years.

I didn't think there was a difference '89 vs. '90.  There is definately
a difference in early 928 vs. later S4 body sytles - The earlier cars
fenders wrap completely around the tire (side view) , the latter only
goes halfway in the front as the new bumper / nose wraps around the
fender, forming the lower fender part.  So yes, two different fenders.

There may be other differences and I hope those that know will add to
this thread - someone needs help in restoring a '90 and has a third
party trying to sell him " '89 fenders" which don't match for some
reason...  I did refer the hopeful restorer to the list, as well as 928
International.

Only you can help save the 928s!
Phil
