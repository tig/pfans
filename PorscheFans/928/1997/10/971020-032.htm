Chris, I really don't think it's going to happen with the 928. I've seen
some other young people at your age pickup a 928 for 4-5k and ended up
having to dump every last penny they ever had in their wallet (and then
some)to keep it on the road. Unless you are *extremely* lucky, a 928 in
good condition, that looks nice, and will be reliable, is out of reach in
your price range.

These cars break down, they always need something to be fixed, you've got
to stay right on top of them. No matter how good Porsche made them, they
are old cars, and things do wear out. Plan on at least another $3-5k in the
first year of ownership. (Then there is insurance, which will be high in a
928 at your age, and plenty of gas, and you see how it adds up).


Hope you find the right solution,

Paul Hatziiliades
