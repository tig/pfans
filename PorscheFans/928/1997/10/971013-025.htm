Thanks for the info Marc,
         yeah I have to admit that  after watching my baby smoke like a
steam engine I was sure a new engine was in the works.  The dealer did an
emissions leak test of the remaining fluid (still boiling hot after about an
hour and a half) to check on a cracked block or gasket leaks  and it came
out negative.  I really really hope this engine is OK, I want to know before
I sink a couple grand into rebuilding the cooling system!  As far as they
have told me now, the engine is absolutely fine, this thing was hot enough
to melt my hood's heat shield, but it appears to be fine.  Unbelievable.
Most of the fluid blew out of the reservoir cap, the rest out of the bottom
of the radiator.  The pump did fail and the radiator is going to cost some
big bucks but I love the damn thing more than life so my emotional pain is
beyond any monetary value!!!
