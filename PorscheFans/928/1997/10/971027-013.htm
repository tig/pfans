> 4. Now my cooling fans won't shut off.I pulled the fuses and put them
back
in and
     the fans shut off.When I turned on the key again the fans came back
on
and won't
     shut off.I pulled the hood release to turn them off this time.Is
there a
temp sensor
     telling the fans not to shut off?

     It sounds like the these repairs are fairly typical,so I have 2
questions
     Does anyone know a good 928 mechanic is the Dallas area ?
     Should I paint my 2x6s black to match my car or leave them natural
to
match my linen interior?

Brad,

The S4's have the trick 3 position air inlet flap system + electric
cooling fans all controlled by the box under the cover to the right of
the passenger's seat.  If any sensor is not giving a sensible reading,
the system goes to full cooling - flaps full open and both fans on.
Look at the factory manual for the trouble shooting on this - it's
pretty detailed.  Essentially, you just pull the plugs to the unit and
check resistances and voltages and the results gives you a pretty good
idea of where to start looking.

BTW, my Frigen sensors reads infinite ohms but everything still seems to
works as spec'ed.  I don't really understand this - the manual says as
soon as you activate the AC, we go to full flaps and fans.  Doesn't
really make sense to me (just because it's activated doesn't mean it's
running AFAIK).  Anyone?

Best,
Kurt

a bit!)
