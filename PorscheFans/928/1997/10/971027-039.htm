I too had this problem on my '91 S4. Mechanic was completely baffled -
tried disconnecting temp sensor, etc. I noticed he had reconnected hood
light - I disconnected hood light, reconnected temp sensor, now works ok,
i.e. follows the manual wrt temp/fan speed graph. I've got to remember to
ask for my hood switch back!
Wiring diagram semi-mystifying - looked like fan and switch for hood light
were related thru some control relay or mosfet. Some kind of control unit
beside the passenger seat - looks like intake air, water temp, other stuff
go thru to output signal for fan control servos. Intended to take a scope
to it - actually I've had a fantasy of redoing the electronics, seems so
primitive and anachronistic - late '70s/early '80s designs...Can't be too
seriously complex ifso. I seriously support the premise of the electrical
system
having potential as an achilles heel for the car.
(beware - gripe ahead)
Overall, the shops I've been to seriously annoy sooner or later with some
kind of crap like this. To wit: ganging up the hours, e.g. one visit doing
three
different jobs requiring the radiator to be out AND charging the time to
take the radiator out 3 times; leaving bolts/screws out; Excessive hours
charged to troubleshooting (8) when the problem was documented in a service
bulletin (I read the service bulletin first)...I've ordered the shop
manuals in self defense.
Well, enuf griping. I worked out my cost of ownership versus say a new
Lexus, BMW, and I still come out ahead (in all respects that matter to me).
I have to say I gave up driving for a while (too annoying) - the 928
seduced me back to
it. I don't drive every day, but when I do I *enjoy* it!
