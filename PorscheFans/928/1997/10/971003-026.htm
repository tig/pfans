Red Line makes an excellent synthetic bearing (extreme pressure) =
grease:

Here's the specs, from www.redlineoil.com/cv2ti.htm:


Red Line CV-2 Grease is designed to withstand the extreme temperatures
and pressures which occur in high-performance wheel bearings and
CV-joints. The excellent high-temperature stability, extreme- pressure
protection, and water resistance enables it to out-perform even the =
best
conventional or synthetic greases. Red Line CV-2 Grease can be used in =
a
wide range of applications at temperatures ranging between -100=B0F to
500=B0F and provides good oxidation and corrosion resistance, low
evaporation and oil separation, and has a minimum effect on rubber
seals. The exceptional extreme- pressure performance and the fluidity =
of
the synthetic oil allows increases in bearing life of 200% to 800%. Red
Line CV-2 Grease contains a red moly compound which is a superior
lubricant to black moly disulfide lubricants.=20

Red Line CV-2 Grease may also be used in industrial applications such =
as
high-temperature alternator bearings, high-speed ball bearings, =
conveyor
bearings, worm gear drives, servo mechanisms, and applications where
vibrations can cause fretting wear and corrosion to take place.=20

Red Line CV-2 Grease will retain its consistency and extreme-pressure
performance under high- temperature and high-shear conditions for
extended periods, which extends the performance ranges of the =
lubricated
components. Red Line CV-2 will darken after high-temperature use; this
darkening will not detrimentally effect the performance of the grease.
Although Red Line CV-2 is compatible with small amounts of many
petroleum-based greases, it is always good lubrication practice to
thoroughly clean out the old grease to eliminate abrasive particles and
to minimize the possibility of grease incompatibility.=20
