I have this problem also and believe I know how to fix it. The white plastic
bushings that Diego mentions are supposed to have elongated holes and need to fit
reasonably loosely on the vertical bar it slides on. This is because the curvature
of the window is different than the curvature of the bar (which roughly mirrors the
doors curvature).

I believe the problem is worn guides at the top of the door. Going by memory (I'm
at work right now), there are two guides on each window - one near the front and
one near the rear. These are bolted on the inside of the exterior part of the door
shell. They are rubber with a felt-like covering. The outside of the window slides
on these guides and they hold the window from rattling back and forth. I've seen
replacement guides in both the Automotion and 928 International catalogs. I don't
remember how much they are, but do remember thinking that the price seemed
excessive. They shouldn't be too difficult to replace. I think there are two bolts
on each one, and they are accessible with the window down, inner door panel off.
