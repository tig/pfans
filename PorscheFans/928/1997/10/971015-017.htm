Beware the cheap 928.

I was looking for a time trial car last Spring and checked out a rough Euro
'84 928S 5-speed for $3,800.

By my rough calculations, the car needed over $4,500 in repairs and
mantenance. (the car just sold for $2,500... as parts)

I checked out a beautiful $3,500 '83 with high miles, and asking around,
determined that between first gear syncros, shocks, and just the 'deferred
maintenance' items, the car needed over $3,000 to get it on the track.

My mechanic has been asked to do pre-purchase inspections on early 928s as
cheap as $3,600. In one case, he estimated it would take over $7,000 to put
it right.

The current market situation on low-end 928s is roughly equivalent to the
XKE Jag situation in the late 70s: many have fallen into the hands of
people who can barely afford thier depressed prices, and who have decided
not to maintain them correctly.

You will always do better to find a well-cared-for car and pay a fair price
for it.
