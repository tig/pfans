I'd say you beat him because he didn't actually know you were there at =
all and he was just driving normally.  When you thought he was looking =
at you he was just admiring the reflection of his fine piece of German =
craftsmanship in the shiney new paint of your Ford.

Also - does your car have a chagrin detector... or were you guessing?

While driving around Austin today in my '97 Mustang Cobra, I happened =
across
what appeared to be a 1987 or newer 928 S4, black.  We were side by =
side,
and he was looking at me like he wanted to race (my Cobra is a =
convertible).

Well, the light turned green and we were off.  Much to his chagrin, I
stomped him.  I was 30 feet ahead until I hit 80, when I slowed down and =
he
blew by.

So tell me this, honestly:  Did I beat him because I have a faster car, =
or
did I beat him because I'm a better driver?
