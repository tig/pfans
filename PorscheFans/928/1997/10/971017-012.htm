PETEOXII@AOL asked

Will spoilers, body kits helped reduce drafts, down force and high speed
racing?
Cost?
Yes, It will help reduced down force and drafts  

Does it make go faster?   NO!   but looks great on the car.

Cost?   Depend on your budgets from $500- $4,000 body kits only.

For racing? The best way to reduce weight or down force is the take the
interior out and lowered it.  

The best of all, ITS your 928. you can do anything with it.
Go ahead, get the spoilers, while you at it, why not put a Chev in it if you
want speed.

Like my 928, I pretty much out done myself and still looking for more.
Body kits with two rear spoilers, lowered with Weltmeister, 17'' turbo wheels
with 235 front and 265 back ZR continental CZ91, ram air hood, nology hot
wires, K & N, twin 3" exhaust tips, A 7,000 rpm tach with shift light. full
interior with carbon fibre knob.  There more to come..................this is
not the best way if you want speed or cut down on weight.   I still have many
projects to make on the 928.

A custom paint job?   Blue on white strip in the middle ( Viper ) ?  A custom
Door opening ( Lamborghini Style)?..   On my drawing board, will post
later........

So many ways to do it, yet so little time.........................
