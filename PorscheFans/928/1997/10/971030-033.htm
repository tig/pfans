Coincidentally, I was talking with Jim Pascha last Sat about refinishing
winshield wiper arms and he recommended sanding with 300 grit wet&dry
followed by Pactra water-based semi-gloss enamel (yes, same as model
airplane stuff) applied with a brush.
According to Jim, the water-based stuff drys fast and hard.  I intend to
experiment with that on my 911 wiper arms prior to fooling around with
precious 928 parts.

I'm not sure if you will apreciate hearing this, but 911 folks who have
a lot of experience removing and replacing windshields say the trick is
to install the metal trim in the rubber, then the rubber on the glass,
and then finally put the whole unit in.  Apparently, the trim will get
munged if you try to put it into the rubber after the rubber/glass is on
the body.
