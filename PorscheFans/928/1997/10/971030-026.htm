The whole process:

1. If you haven't already switched, change your engine oil to a good
synthetic 15W50 or 20W50 (candidates include Mobil 1, Red Line, and Amsoil,
the last of which is made in Wisconsin). This will give you full protection
at high engine speeds and loads, but still flow well in Madison, Wisconsin
temperatures (extremely cold locations may require the next lighter weight
oil). Synthetics congeal much less profoundly over a cold night than do
petroleum oils, so you shouldn't have trouble starting. You will want to
make sure that oil and coolant are both well warmed up before pushing hard,
but that's true in the summer as well..

2. If you have a manual transmission, synthetic gear oil will give similar
benefits, as discussed in a lot of posts over the last week or so.

3. If you're using summer-type performance tires, the tread rubber gets
hard below freezing. Four-season performance tires (e.g., Michelin Pilot
XGTZ4) don't have this problem, but are still not highly effective snow
tires. Several makers produce speed rated true snow tires (e.g., Michelin X
M+S 330).

4. Recognize that you've got a powerful car with only 50% of its weight on
the drive wheels, so proceed with care on icy or snowy surfaces, just as
you do now on rainy ones.

That's it!
