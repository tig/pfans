Well gentleman,

I was just leafing through an old car and driver and saw the four or so
paragraph sidebar and photo on said last 928.  Here's as much as I can
remember

Engine was stock S4

Color was bright f-ing green, the paint alone, which was a special
order, was $20,000
THe car came with six extra cans of the potent green paint,

The interior was done in the most luxiourious PURPLE leather that I have
ever seen, the amount and placement of leather was not unlike the 911
Turbo-s, leather dash, everything was coated in this stuff.  As with the
paint, this was at least a $50000 extra, as the dye for the purple is
usually used in the aerospace industry, the car came with a bunch of
extra yards of the stuff.

That's all I can remember, but...the sticker price...$181,000

Whoa

That's my 2 cents...I'll go find waht issue it was and post that also.

Ciao

Joe West
