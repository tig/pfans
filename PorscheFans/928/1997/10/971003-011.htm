I have been thinking about buying a 928 lately.  I think I have narrowed it
down to a 87-89 S4.  I want to spend about $20K-$30K.

Does anyone know how many were made for each of those years  (US model)?
Does anyone know what % were 5-speed VS automagic?  I will only buy a
5-speed, but so far I have not had much luck finding one for sale.

Anyone have any suggestions for critical items that I should check when
shopping?  Are there any really common failures that I should be looking
for?  Valuable options that I should be keeping an eye out for?

Also, does anyone recomend a good 928 mechanic in LA?

Please reply directly, I am not on the list.
