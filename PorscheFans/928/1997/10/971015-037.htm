 Hi,
   I had sent this message to Josh after hearing about his problem
 but now that someone else is in need of a radiator I though I'd 
 post it here.
 
 
   Read about your problem on the digest. I recently had to replace
 my radiator on my 78. After pricing arround I bought the radiator
 through DEVEK. Their radiator is all aluminum (no cheesy plastic
 end caps like the factory replacement) and it was cheaper and better
 than the $1200 factory one. I've been very
 happy with it. A couple of weeks ago I was at a drivers school in
 100+ degree weather and the temp never went past the middle of the 
 range. By the way it does have the built in oil cooler as well.
 
    I'm not associated with DEVEK, I'm just a satisfied customer.

 Eddie
