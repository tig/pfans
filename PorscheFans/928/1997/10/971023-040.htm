I the owner of both an 1982 928S Coupe and a 1998 C5 Convertible.  I just
 wanted to let you know my feelings on your post.   First off, the numbers
you
 are throwing out are ridiculous.  My 928 is an automatic so I don't have to
 worry about a clutch job, which in reality, (according to everything I've
seen
 and heard from fellow Porschephilies) not as your bantering suggests, only
 costs about $2500-3000 and if the car is maintained well and not driven like
 it is a piece of shit, the clutch should last at least 50,000+ miles, not
 10,000 as you think.  Further more the water pump is not a $1200 part, it is
 only $105.00 with probably two or maybe three hours of labor, and as with
the
 clutch, will last forever if maintained properly.  My 928 is 15 years old,
 with 48,000 documented second owner miles, knock on wood, the car hasn't had
 any major mechanical problems, just had to replace things that do get worn
out
 over 15 years.  My C5 which I took delivery of yesterday is a beautiful car,
 although I feel that the 928 is a much nicer grand tourer with allot of
power.
  I guess I have the best of both worlds!!!


Harry
1982 Porsche 928S Coupe, Platinmetalic over Cashmere Leather
48,000 Original two owner miles, fully doc'd and legit
----
1998 Corvette C5 Convertible, Sebring Silver over Grey Leather with a Black
 Canvas Top.
144 Miles and a Road Rocket!

P.S. If the 928 is another piece of over engineered german  junk, then why
did
 Dave Hill use many aspects of the 928 (Which debuted in 1977) on the brand
new
 1997 C5 when it came out 20 years later??  Just my .928 and .c5 cents.

CORVETTES AND 928's FOREVER!!!
