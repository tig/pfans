Hey Stephane, How ya doing?
The guy I got my grease from is a Shell and Chevron distributor. Mostly
concerned about not mixing bases and having compatible grease. He had a book
on greases and their uses, and the only Retinax that was supposed to be used
on wheel bearings was a Retinax LC. He could only sell it to me in a case of
10, but since I really only needed a tube, (and didn't know when I'd ever use
a case of the stuff) he recommended a Chevron grease that he said was a
better grease, and he already had a broken case. It's called Chevron
Ultra-Duty Grease EP  NLGI2. 
I pulled my calipers, bearing caps, and wheel bearing nuts and slid off the
rotor /     bearing assembly. I was very carefull to keep any grit out of the
bearings and grease!
I cleaned the spindle and backing plate, then cleaned the bearing seal. I
stuck my fingers in the cavity of the rotor / bearing assembly and pulled out
some of the existing grease. I pushed new grease in and around the inner
bearing and filled the cavity with new grease. (leaving a hole the diameter
of the spindle or so) I cleaned some of the grease off the outer bearing and
applied new grease working it in with my fingers. ( I looked at each bearing
and the race and saw no pits or problem areas)
I guess maybe a bearing packer would be better, but since I had no noise or
problems, I elected to only re-grease without washing all the old grease out.
Also, I didn't really want to mess with pressing out the races and inner
bearing.
I used about 1/4 of a tube of grease total.
Re-adjust as was explained at the Frenzy. (it's in manuals too) Tighten nut
while turning wheel and back off until you can just barely move the washer
with a screwdriver. My wheels still turn about 2 turns with a good tug, but
do not have any play as before. (when I grabbed top and bottom of wheel
before adjustment, there was a little looseness in the bearing, now, all is
well.)
Pretty easy job though. Just glad the Frenzy put a bug in my ear to check
periodically. You guys are all checking and re-adjusting yours every 20k,
right? (other checks pending)
Hope this helps.
Best Regards,
Greg S.    87' 5spd.
