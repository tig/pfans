Yesterday, the car balked and started then stranded me two miles from home.
It
turned over but wouldn't fire,  It has been flatbedded to the wrench.

Now I'm thinking fuel pump relay, fuel filter and the fuel system for who
knows what.......Anybody got any suggestions as to what to check next


My '85 left me stranded on 3 occasions; 2 of them were due to the Air Mass
Sensor (the Air Mass Sensor in the LH-Jetronic cars replaced the 'flapper
door' air flow sensor in the L-Jetronic cars).  There is a wire in the
sensor over which the intake air is drawn.  The computer measures how much
energy is required to maintain the wire at a certain temperature taking
into account other factors such as the ambient air temperature.  Based upon
this, it can measure the mass of the intake air (LH-Jetronic) rather than
only measuring the volume (L-Jetronic).

If the wire breaks, the car won't run.  I believe that on later models, the
computer has a default reading it uses in case the sensor doesn't function.
The car would be in 'limp mode' to allow you to get to the nearest
mechanic.  Anyway, both times mine broke within a mile of the house after
firing up the car first thing in the morning.  Not a cheap part.  I
replaced the first one with a used sensor.  It lasted a couple years and
the second time I ponied up for a new one.

You can check the wire by removing the air filter and looking through the
sensor.  The wire is very fine and difficult to see.  There is also a mesh
which looks like a screen door at the front opening of the sensor; the wire
is behind the mesh.

Since the cars are so complicated, it is often difficult to troubleshoot
problems.  With 160K on the car when I sold mine, I had only replaced 3
fuel injection/engine management components: Air Mass Sensor twice, a
temperature sender and the lambda sensor.  One other hint - when the car
starts idling rough and running poorly, many times it is an intake air
leak.  You need to look for melted hoses and leaky connections...including
all the places you can't see down below the intake manifolds.
