Hi Kelly,

I'm a bit late reading your email as I've been out of the country but I do
have a
couple of comments.

>Maybe I should buy a 944 Turbo. But, I don't think so. I can't get one for
>$4000 to $6000. Or maybe a 928 with a blown engine and put a Chevy in it

I had a friend who owned a 1986 944 Turbo.  It was a great car and very
fast.  Unfortunately, his fuel pump relay stuck one day, caused a fuel line
to rupture
and turned his car into a fireball.  The whole engine compartment was "Toast."

As for a 928 with a Chevy motor in it, WELL, That sounds absolutely obscene!

RUST, not on a 928 with the exception of the hatch in the back.  I believe
that most if not all of the rest of the body is made out of ALUMINUM.

Since you sound like a guy with sufficient mechanical skills, your
ownership of a 928 shouldn't be too frustrating.  There are some
electro-mechanical problems that occur from time to time.  However, if you
can do basic electrical and mechanical troubleshooting you should be able
to fix most of them by yourself.  If not, there are numerous people on this
list who are extremely familiar with the quirks of 928's who will help you
with your problems.

Good driving,
Bob East
78 928
