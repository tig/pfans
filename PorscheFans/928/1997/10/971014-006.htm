Thank you to everybody who replied. I welcome your further comments. I
should probably have been a little clearer as to where I'm coming from. I'm
a long time Alfa Romeo fan, so I know from rust! And that's my major
concern. I HAVE researched 928 parts prices ($500 for a wiper motor does
NOT shock me anymore). I'm not afraid of rebuilding used parts or doing any
work on any component of my cars. What I am afraid of are design/build
flaws like blown head gaskets every 15k, RUST, RUST, RUST, cracking blocks,
$500 tools that are used once every five years, did I mention rust? and
stuff like that. The shop that does work on my Alfas also works on
Porsches, so I'm confidant knowing that what I can't handle, I can take to
a shop that I know and trust.

I don't mean to insult anybody, but it seems to me 928 values are rock
bottom. The Kelley Blue Book retail on a 1980 with auto and 150K is $4050.
Most of the people I've talked to forecast a two to five percent increase
in value over the next five years. This all means absolutely nothing to me,
except for; what is it going to cost ME? If I can get (and it seems very
likely) a clean 928 with a strong engine, straight body, no/very little
rust, straight maintenance records, but worn interior, dings in the paint,
mid 100 K miles for $4 to 6K, then I'm there (assuming I sell one of my
Alfas). But, when I see a 1978 with 173K for $10,000, I start to think that
I can't afford the initial investment. So, your advice helps a lot to get a
bead on the real retail values nation-wide.

It is fascinating to me that the value of a 928 is so disproportionate to a
911. It seems to me that this is based purely on body style. In my opinion
the 928 is superior in every way. In comfort AND configuration. More power
without a blower equals more cylinders. Winner: 928. Drive across America
in comfort and quiet. Winner: 928. Engine accessiblity. Winner: 928. Air
cooled or water cooled. Winner: 928. 50/50 weight distribution, not so
scary tail-out. Winner: 928.

Hey, mister, why don't you buy a 928? Well, uh, I don't like the look of it.

I realize that I am not an expert. I'm sure you all know much, much more
than I about Porsches. This is just what I'm thinking. Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe I should buy a 944 Turbo. But, I don't think so. I can't get one for
$4000 to $6000. Or maybe a 928 with a blown engine and put a Chevy in it
(I'm serious, sorry. Anybody buy Renegade Hybrids' engine kit?).

I'll keep researching and searching for my 78 - 85 928 for less than $6K.
Thanks again. Also, I promise not to tell anybody what rock bottom prices
928s are going for. What other foreign supercar of that era could you get
for those prices? I can't think of one that compares. Any other advice or
comments are welcome.

Kelly
