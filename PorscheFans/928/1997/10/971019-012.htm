Which car do you guys think corners and handles better, a 944 or a 928?
I'm in the market for a CHEAP used 928 or 944 that is reliable and has a
nice exterior. I think the 928 is the better looking car among the
two (many seem to disagree with me though on this) and it appears that
even the slowest 928s 0 to 60 in under 7 seconds. It seems there are
always ten times as many 944s for sale compared to the 928 and the 944s
are also usually 50% to 100% cheaper than the 928. If someone
is on a REALLY limited budget ($4000 to possibly 5k or 6k), should they
give up all hope of ever owning a reliable and decent 928 and instead
opt for the 944? I'm curious about the handling differences between the
two cars. If the 944 handles as good as a 928, or better, then maybe I
should go with a 944 for now (the 944s gas mileage sure is good to, like
anyone cares ;-)

Thanks guys for any advice,
