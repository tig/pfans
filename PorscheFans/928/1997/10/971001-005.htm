Greetings:

I have been reading the PorscheFans 928 messages for several months now
in preparation for a purchase, and have just left a deposit on a 1988 S4
with 60k miles in beautiful shape. (I have been a die-hard fan of the 928
since 1977 -- at age 17 -- but until now, other priorities have conspired to
prevent a purchase.) The dealer, Cherry Hill Imports here in NJ, is doing
the 60k service and fixing a few minor cosmetics as part of the deal
($20k), and also plans to replace the shocks.

Having driven 3 different 928s before settling on this one, I noticed
that the ride is noticably harder in the one I'm buying than it is in the
other 2. Preferring a ride that is not quite so hard, I'm wondering if anyone
knows what might cause the difference. Was there a competition suspension
offered in '88? Can softer shocks be installed on such a suspension?
Anything known on this subject would be greatly appreciated.

My second question relates to Leonard's car. I remember that several
months ago ne mentioned getting a custom programmed chip for his 928 somewhere
on Long Island. As I hope to "chip" my 928 as well, could I ask where
that was and what they did?

In advance, my thank you everyone for your time. I hope this is not an
imposition. 

Sincerely,

==>> sh <<==
