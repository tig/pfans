Hi Phil,

I have tried a product, sucessfully in my case, that softens leather.  I
found out about it from John Paterek, the PCA restoration guru. It's called
"Color Plus Soffener" and it's available from his wife's business
(coincidentally), "Paterek Preferred" at 201.635.0689 in NY. I forget the
price, but it was something like $10 for a pint, but my memory could be
failing me. The Soffener comes in two strengths, the maintenance formula from
above and a restorer/conditioner, higher strength formula. The higher
strength formula, I bought from the manufacture of the stuff: Color Plus in
Milford, PA. 717.686-3158. The owner's name is Judy. She's been doing this
for many years. The company used to called "Surflex".
Anyway, I have a '90 S4 which a bought about a year ago out of LA. and had
been parked in the sun often. The supple leather wasn't supple any more. I
tried the heavy duty fromula and it brought the leather back. The car also
has the "leather luggage compartment cover" option which had shrunk
considerably. Probably the second worst think to have in leather next to a
leather dash. I was hopping I could bring that back too. Judy said it won't
bring back shrunk leather, and she was right.

Hope that helps bringing your seats back.

John Weber
