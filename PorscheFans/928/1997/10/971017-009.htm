I bought an '80 928 in Dallas in August, drove it home (some 375 miles)
parked it in the garage overnight. Next morning opened garage to a pool
of hi-test, and a still leaking tank. I ordered a used tank from PAP in
Atlanta $450+shipping. While awaiting it's arrival I researched many
places for possible patch options. I finally went to an RV superstore
and obtained a product designed to patch polypropylene butane tanks on
RV's. Product is a mixable item, 2 tubes, but I've forgotten the name.
There are many different kinds available but the proprietor of this shop
contacted his distributor, explained my problem and the distributor
confirmed that this was the proper product. I cleaned the area where my
leak was, actually an age crack, roughed the patch area and applied the
product. I let it cure overnight and into the next day prior to
introducing fuel back in the tank. That was some 2500 miles ago and so
far no leaks. I still have the used tank for when this one gives up the
ghost, and will probably cahnge them out if I develop another leak. If
you need any nore info email me at budrn@arn.net
