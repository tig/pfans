     After reading all of the latest posts about improving or upgrading 
     speakers, I have some stereo upgrade questions. I want to upgrade the 
     sound quality of my '91 GT which has the factory Blaupunkt with 
     120-watt 6 channel amp and 10 speaker system. My wife's '95 BMW with 
     factory 200-watt amp and 10 speaker system puts mine to shame for 
     sound quality. 
     
     My thoughts are that the speakers and head unit are of good quality 
     but the amp is limited. I have been thinking about upgrading the power 
     to the speakers with a 200-watt 4 channel amp to tweeter/mid pair sets 
     F/R and then add a 200-watt 2 channel amp to the bass units in the 
     rear. The wiring diagram shows some type of crossovers built into the 
     speaker wiring diagrams. Will my approach work by just splitting the 
     input from the head unit to the amps and wiring speakers directly from 
     the amp outputs? I know I'll have to find good locations to mount the 
     amps for space and cooling. I'm a mechanical engineer so I can figure 
     that out, but I'm not much of an EE or stereo whiz. I will probably 
     upgrade the head unit later, but I would like to keep the factory 
     speakers. Any help or recommendations on my approach to improving 
     sound quality would be appreciated.
