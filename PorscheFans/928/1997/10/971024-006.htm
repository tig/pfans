 What plastic fingers?  I've worked on many double-disk clutches and 
don't seem to remember any plastic fingers--other than the plastic 
ball-joint liner in the control arm, which is not a critical piece.  
(There are a couple of rubber mounts on the control arm, but these are 
not involved in power-transfer...)
 Just as a point of reference, I have done countless (well, maybe 30-40) 
burnouts on several clutch packages.  IMO, something far worse is a 
"partially engaged" burn-out. That is, when the clutch is slipping when 
your at/near full power.  This will burn/glaze the surface of the clutch 
plate, intermediate plate, and flywheel surface.  This will substantially 
reduce the clutch grip, and just basically ruin it.  If the glazing is 
not *too* bad, one can resurface the disks/flywheel/intermediate plate. 
(I tried this once, and it did work--probably 90% grip of new.)
 Also, my '85 DP car had a Camden 9" blower on it running at around 8 lbs 
of boost.  The torque generated was probably around 500 ft-lbs.  I have 
345/35s on the back.  The double-disc clutch had no problems delivering 
the power for the most awesome burnouts imaginable.
 One more thing, it is actually *harder* on the clutch to be fully 
engaged while in 4th or 5th at high highway speeds with it floored, 
at/around your peak engine torque (2500-2700rpm for 32v, 4200-4500rpm for 
16v).  This is because your delivering the maximum *sustained* torque 
with little or no acceleration of the vehicle.
 I'm amazed at how TOUGH the 928 drive-train is.  Aside from the early 
year's weak synchros, it's the most robust OEM drive-train I've ever seen.
 No, I'm not advocating "928-abuse," but I say: "Exploit these cars!"  
Everyone wants to baby them--they want to be DRIVEN--to the edge...at 
least every now, and then.

<<What is the correct color of the 'last' 928 (no it's not chartreuse,

I've been corrected!)>>

It was like a Lime green without so much lime.... would have made a good hi-
liter color.   And it had green/purple int.  Can't come up with te factory
assigned color though.  I do know that a doctor in Fla bought it and just had
it in to Champion Motors (where it was sold) for an oil change last week.  He
drives it almost everyday.
