Hot Damn I think we have a winner here...?
Anyways, this is too excrutiating for me too so challenge #2 goes to Jim
Stadter!
Here's some text I received on that 'last 928' - page update to follow:


"  The 928 with "the wild chartreuse paint job" is not chartreuse, it's
pearl yellow.  Or Elfenbein Perlglanz in Porsche speak.  A very, very
expensive option, due to the fact that the paint formulation violates
German EPA regs and Porsche pays a jumbo fine to produce a car with it."

"  I'm not in to Porsche paint trivia, I happen to own a 928 S4 that was

built as the "10th Anniversary 928" for the Frankfurt Auto Show.  It's
absolutely identical to the car in your photo, with the exception of the

spoiler and the interior.  The interior of my car is also completely
leather, but it's all light grey.  I bought the car from the Toy Store
Group in Florida last year.  It had 17,000 miles on it and I've been
driving the hell out of it ever since.  The car is cherry and I love
it."

" Best,
mike  "

Whew, that was a good one huh?
More surprises in store soon, until then, have a 928 weekend!
