Ok Ed, we are all anxiously awaiting word from the PCA!  Thanks for your
efforts!
Great post from our 'senior' shark - pkal - keeper of the flame!
Leonard has drafted very succinctly a go-forward basis for the club
Anyone notice all the other activity reports starting to come in from
around the world?
We are not alone!
911 & Porsche world will be featuring the 928 Spyder next month.
(Let me borrow Jim's idea and say we all chip in a hundred bucks and go
get one!  Heck a one day rental would be really cool...)

Worldwide request/challenge:
1.  Who of you will be the first 928 Club Sport to grace the 928's
Forever gallery?
2.  The 928 Club Sport SE ice has been broken (Philip Adamson)!
     Other examples need to be found...
3.  Where is the earliest 928 in the world?  We have documented car #29
in the U.S...
4.  Rumors abound there is a challenger to the 'last' 928 GTS position
5.  928 field report photos wanted from all clubs on all continents
6.  Amazingly we have only 1 registrant from Denmark and 1 from
Australia from the world!  Sign in at Doug's page and help spread the
word!

More to come,
Phil
