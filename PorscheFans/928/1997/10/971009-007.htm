I've had good luck with Chevron premium, but several cars I've
had run badly on Texaco gas, so I don't go there any more.

It could be just the Texaco near my house...I don't know.

see:

SI-1 and SI-2 are the same product, just different packaging sizes.
SI-1 is approved by BMW, and has a BMW part number.

BTW, I will ask Roy Howell at Red Line what
he knows about Techron--at one point, I know they tested all major
gasoline brands and found them all leaving about the same amount
of deposits on the backs of the valves and the injectors.

I'd have to agree, within reason...don't go cranking 114 octane Sunoco
purple (race gas) into it, unless you do a lot of research....many
engines
not designed for race-levels of octane will actually run badly on race
gas.

I've had mixed results with various motorcycles.

**** These guys ROCK!  Great technical advice by email, order by
email, they ship right away, never screw up, and always seem to 
have the best price.  I don't even check prices elsewhere anymore.
(no, I'm not affiliated or even friends with these guys....they've just
given me really great service).
