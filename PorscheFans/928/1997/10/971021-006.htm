I definitely agree w/ not buying a '28 simply because it is cheap. My 84   
is becoming a great car, but it has taken two years to get there. When I   
purchased it, the interior and exterior were in great shape, but   
mechanically, there were several things that needed attention.   
Fortunately this car is my hobby and I can afford the drain. 10 years ago   
I could not have afforded the maintenance.

Several items to keep in mind when buying a "cheap" 928 ( most of these   
can happen to all older cars, but in a Porsche they hurt worse):

1. Aluminum ball joints
2. Steering rack
3. A/C problems can be very expensive
4. Electrical problems
5. $400 door latches
6. $270 starter
7. Clutches
8. Timing belts
9. $150 plug wires
10. 8 quarts of oil
11. $50 air filters
12. etc., etc.

These are truly great cars, but not for everyone. You have to be willing   
to stay on top of the maintenance or you can end up with a 2 ton door   
stop. But, oh, when you have a long way to go and a short time to get   
there (sounds like a song), there is no substitute.

<<The car has a Autothority chip which I want to replace with the original

due to my concerns about additional wear.>>

I have no idea who started everyone worrying about extra wear being put on a
car by changing the computer chip, but it's ridiculous.  In no way does a
computer chip put any more strain on your engine.  All they do is re-map the
timing, fuel injector flow and rpm limiter.  If you buy a quality chip from
the likes of AutoThority they come with a money back satisfaction guaranteed
warranty fo at least one year.  Plus, they've been extensively tested before
being sold to the public.  I have both AutoThority chips in my 87 928S4 and
couldn't be happier.  Don't succumb to old wive's tales.  Buy a chip, drive
fast (but safely), enjoy life.

P.S.  I just picked up a diamond blue/maroon leather 1987 928S4 auto that is
in beautiful shape.  Had it checked out by my mechanic alrerady.  The car is
here in Evansville IN and ready for sale.  Get in touch with me.
