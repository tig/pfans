For those considering catalytic bypasses on 928 and 928S:

Having driven the '85 928S both catalytic equipped and test pipe
equipped, I have some notes:
- Much Quieter with the cat on, not as quiet as the S4, but
  quieter than it was, Especially after 3K rpm,
- also after 3K rpm, the timbre is 'Smoother' with the cat on, 
- no real feelable difference in power; still the same
  'adrenalin grin when you hit 3K rpm' that
  we know and love.  The '85 has the Autothority chips and
  maybe this makes more of a difference.(?)

The cat was purchased from one of our very own: Paul Hatziiliades.  
David Roberts also supplied a few misc parts during my tenure.  
Both supplied great products and prices, although David R
might not share my sentiments on the K&N filter  
(not that I want to kick THAT horse again...).
