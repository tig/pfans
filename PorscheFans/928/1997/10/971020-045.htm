Well, i figured i should come out of hibernation and ask the all knowing
list a quick question about aftermaket alarms.  I have finally got around
to ripping out the OLD OLD OLD aftermarket alarm the was installed in my
'83 S by previous owners past (no ill will here...) and replacing it with a
NEW NEW NEW techie Clifford alarm with all of the bells and whistles, well
some of them anyways...

so the questions if  you please...

do i need to have an actuator to get the alarm to operate the power door
locks, its (the alarm) a Clifford Intelligaurd 800-IQ (ya would think if
the bloody thing was so smart it whould be able to install itself... :) ?!?
The feature is apparently built into the alarm, so i dont beleive i will
need any relays to do this.

secondly, is there anything special /fancy i need to do to get the
headlights under the control of the alarm, or is there a simple way to do
this; i am assuming i will need a relay to take care of this one, but
outside of that i haven't got the foggiest.

Oh and yes i do have the installers instr. from Clifford for the alarm, but
it leaves a few gapping holes, and yes i do have the Factory shop manuals,
but i am having a helluva time trying to decipher the wiring diagrams
correctly ( current track this,  connector that... just tell me which wire
damn it :)

And if you are wondering why the heck i am doing this, instead of taking it
to a "professional", well the last time i had said professional install an
alarm they killed my ingition circutry, not such a big deal in a CJ7, but i
am not going to let those monsters anywhere near my Porsche, or my Jeep
again for that matter.

Kind words of encouragement, advice, as well as any and all help greatly
appreciated.

BTW,
just got the car back from Mark and Susan; no i didnt have them do any mods
just some minor repairs (well o.k. maybe a craked control arm isnt so minor
but thats another story...), and it handles like a dream again. Man o' man
is this car fun to drive!  A BIG thanks to Mark and Susan, and Bob, for
getting my baby back in shape. Now if i can only find a couple of the gold
anodized 16x7 wheels i will be in great shape.


cheers,
g.
