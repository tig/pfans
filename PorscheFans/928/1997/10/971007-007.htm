thanks!>>

Sure!  I appreciate you giving me the chance to help you out.  As you may
know I am a small one-man operation, but I have found quite a few cars for
people on the P-fans list already and would love to help you find a 928 as
well.  Here is all the info I have on the 2 928's at this time:

1989 928GT 5-spd, black/black, 30K miles, CD player, 16" Racing Dynamics
rims, heavily optioned and in excellent shape.
I sold this car the the owner back in Nov and now he is trading it for a
Testarossa.  I am planning on getting this car pretty cheap on trade and will
hopefully be able to sell it for around $21 or $22K.

1987 928S4, diamond blue/maroon leather, auto, 73K miles w/ 60K service,
polished rims, 2nd owner, no rear a/c, new a/c compressor, 8 way pwr  seats.
I am taking this car in on trade for an Acura NSX ... I haven't seen the car
yet, but it is in KY about 45 min. away from me and I could look at and get
this car immediately if you wanted to buy it before I get the owner his NSX.
 Price should be between $15 and $16K.

If you aren't interested in either of these cars I will be glad to find you
another 928.  Here is some info on my locating services.  Give me a call
anytime.
Regards,
Brian

Thank you for your interest in my locating and brokering service.  Although I
specialize in Porsche and Mercedes-Benz I am able to locate almost any
automobile that you would have an interest in purchasing.  Below is an
explanation of what I do as well as the rates for my services.  

First Steps:
During our initial conversation I will discuss with you exactly what you are
looking for in an automobile.  How you plan to use the car, your preferred
interior and exterior colors, mileage, transmission type, service history,
and preferred condition of the body and mechanicals are all very important to
me as I am locating your next automobile.  The maximum price you are willing
to pay for the perfect example of what you are looking for will also be
discussed.

Locating Process:
After our initial conversation I will begin searching for your car based on
the criteria you have given me by utilizing various automobile publications
and the Internet, as well as several automobile dealers and wholesalers that
I have active business relationships with.  Usually it will take me from
three to seven days to find between five and fifteen cars that fall within
your specifications.  Before I am in touch with you again I will call the
owners of each of these automobiles and obtain all of the important
information on each of them.  Next comes your decision - which of the cars
that I have found interests you the most.

Final Steps:
After you decide which cars you have the most interest in you then must also
decide how involved you would like me to be in the purchasing process.
 Although I always try to locate automobiles that are within driving distance
of the client's home, sometimes the exclusivity of certain brands and models
limits the choices, making  travel necessary.  In this case I can arrange to
have pictures or a video of the car sent to you, as well as have a
pre-purchase inspection performed on the automobile by an honest and
reputable third-party mechanic.  If time or finances limits you from
personally flying or driving to take possession of the car then door to door
delivery can also be arranged.

Rates:
Before the first steps of the locating process are begun I require that a
fifty dollar ($50) non-refundable deposit be sent to cover my time and
telephone charges in the event that you decide not to purchase an automobile
through me.  It's unfortunate that I have to require this, but more than once
I have spent quite a bit of time, trouble, and money trying to locate a car
for a less than serious buyer - leaving me with nothing but an elevated phone
bill!  However, when deals go through smoothly the $50 deposit is applied to
the purchaser's final locating cost.  The final charge will depend on my
level of involvement in the purchase and delivery of your car, but the
average range is between $550 and $650 (including the $50 deposit).

Advantages of Buxton Motorsports:
There are many benefits to dealing with a small, individually owned locating
service such as mine.  One is that I take pride in what I do.  By doing
business with me you will always deal with the owner, not a secretary or
"order taker," and I will always be working to find you the best automobile
for your money.  Also, as compared with other locating companies the fees
that I charge are very reasonable due in part to my low overhead costs.  This
benefits the purchaser by not having the price of the automobile raised by $1
- $2,000, enabling all of your money to work towards your purchase.  As the
past and present owner of various sports cars I understand the difference
that $1,000 can make in the mileage and cosmetic / mechanical conditions of
many cars.  Another advantage is that I am honest and offer nationwide
locating and a great deal of very personal service to the purchaser.  And
finally, as mentioned before, every deal is important to me, so weeks of
waiting will not be a part of the locating process.  The average time it
takes for me to locate most sports and luxury cars is three to five days.
 Again, thank you for your interest and please feel free to contact me at the
above phone numbers to discuss any of this information further.
