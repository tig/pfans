I just got finished spending the late afternoon with Lucky Ekman and go to be
the first to check out his new toy, a 90 928S4 that he bought a few hours ago
here in Atlanta.

A beautiful S4, perfect black paint w/silk grey interior, and the deal that he
got gives credit to his name "Lucky".

Lucky drove it to my house immediately after the purchase to scrounge through my
parts to get some of the little items it needed (needed very little, almost a
perfect car), and some engine stuff for one of his other 928 "beast" projects.

He is now in en route back to Panama City after driving up today in a rental
car, I wish him a safe journey, especially since he has been driving all day and
will probably not get home until around 3AM tonight.

Enjoyed the visit and keep it on the road Lucky,
