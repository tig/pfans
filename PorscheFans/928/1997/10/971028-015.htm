Math - My brother races a Spitfire in vintage races. He had exactly
the same failure as he turned sharply right to exit the pits after
a practice run at Watkins Glen, at about 5 mph. I agree that the
forces must be greatest whne making sharp turns at slow speed, though
it isn't apparent to me why that's so. Maybe we'll have to leave it
to one of our resident physics professors.
