The best route is to buy an interior from a wrecked late model 928. For
$3-4,000, you can get a first rate, mint interior. Seats, carpets, dash,
pod, everything... I mean mint, I had a nice 91' gray interior that I sold
for $3.5k, and it was absolutely beautiful!

Re-doing the interior is big bucks. If everything needs replcement, its not
worth it. If only a couple items are worn, then go ahead and have a shop
re-cover them. Otherwise, buy a complete interior in excellent shape and
drop it in.
