Konis, to match the Koni rears I've already put on.  My question is, does anyone know if 
I can replace my non height-adjustable struts with the later model adjustable ones?  
Seems like they would just bolt right in.(?)  Or do I only need the adjusting collar and 
threaded piece?  How about the spring perch?  If I need to upgrade the whole strut, does 
the same Koni insert fit both, or are the sizes somewhat different?  I assume I still use 
my old springs with the new struts(?).  (Yeah, I know what happens when you assume, 
that's why I'm asking...)

Tom,

  I bought front height adjusters from Mark at 928 Int'l a while ago.  I don't 
  remember the exact price, but I'm pretty sure it was under $100 for all the
  pieces you would need (which are: threaded sleeve that slips over the strut,
  threaded collar that screws onto the sleeve, and a lower spring perch designed
  for the adjustable setup).
  
  You should be able to use the Konis with your existing springs.  As a point
  of reference, someone (I think it was Kurt Gibble) said to set the adjustment
  on the Konis to 2 turns away from soft when using high-rate (e.g. Weltmeister)
  springs.  I would think you would go with less than two turns with stock springs.
