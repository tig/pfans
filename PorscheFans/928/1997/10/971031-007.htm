> When was the last time you saw a cracked dash, even on a piece of Detroit
iron?..
Last week when I was in my parents 88 Chevy Corsica.  It has several
cracks, most small in the corners where there is more stress, but there
are two large ones, over 6" that is.  

This car is more the exception than the norm.  I agree, most US/Japanese
car dash pads from the 80's do not cracked.  At least not as frequent as
I've seen on the Porsches.  The 88 Corsica I drive daily and have 94k on
still has a good dash, but one of the plastic door panels is starting to
develop a few cracks. 

Regardless, I agree the plastic components from Porsche are not where
they should have been for the $ they charged.  I wonder if among the
German car makers if this is a Porsche problem, or do Audi, BMW,
Mercedes and VW cars from the 80's also have these problems?
