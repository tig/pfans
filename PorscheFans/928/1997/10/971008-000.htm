Hello all, 
Been away for a few days. The Huber Winery event was indeed a great time!
Yes, I got to meet "Fan" member Brian Buxton, and as he states in his 10-4
post, 
it was a perfect day!  Brian's an exceptionally nice guy and I really enjoyed
his company. (thanks for the compliment Brian, and I'm not just saying this
to reciprocate -- I mean it) 
Although I was sorta hoping he'd drive his 928, I was utterly floored by his
black 79' 930. Man, this car stole the show with those fat tires on gorgeous
Kinesis 3 piece mesh wheels. This car was serious fast! I watched and
listened as we came and left the Winery, and the turbo whoosh, was
accompanied by a squat of the rear end and a very noticeable increase in
velocity. (He's gonna take me for a ride in it the next time we get
together.) 
I'm normally not a big promoter of  911's, but you'd have to be comatose not
to lust for an example such as this one!
  
Coming home from Indiana late Sunday night on I-64 near Frankfort, Ky. got
passed by a newer black 911. (I was going 80... he was probably going 100) I
thought well, I'll just keep him in site and get home a little quicker. Well,
as miles went by, he was sorta loosing me, but since I knew this area was
heavily radared I kinda stayed back. Well, sure enough, I popped over a rise
and got instant-on'd doing 82 in a 65 zone by a Ky. State Trooper. He pulled
me over, asked for my license, and asked if I'd been drinking. I said no at
first, not thinking I'd had 2 bourbon and cokes with a late dinner at a
friends house. He said he could smell alcohol and asked again and I told him
I forgot I had a couple drinks 2 hours ago with dinner. Well he asked me to
get out of the car and he did the ol' wave the finger and you follow it with
your eyes sobriety test. I guess I didn't do good enough so he got the
breathalyzer out of his car. I said oh my god, please (grovelling at this
point as I did not want my first DUI) He assured me that if I felt like I was
ok, the breathalyzer will show the same. I was scared stiff though. Well, I
blew in it and I'm watching the LED's on the meter and it's fluctuating
around .003 (or .03?) and .004 (or .04?) and I don't know what the legal
limit is, and I'm sweating bullets and he says "see I told you that if you
felt ok there was nothing to worry about--you're fine"  Then he says "that's
a nice car" and asked "what size motor you got in that thing?" I told him it
was a 5 liter V8 and I was just trying to stay with the 911 that had passed
me earlier. He asked if I was mad he passed me and I told him of course not,
I was just trying to get home a little quicker following him. He said he
clocked him at 78 (he must've gotten a radar detection from the car in front
and got slowed some) He goes on saying that he normally wouldn't let someone
doing 17mph over the limit go, but since he'd done scared the bejesus out of
me with the breathalyzer, he'd let me go. I told him sorry, I guess I just
enjoy driving. He asked "how fast is it?" I said laughingly "Faster than that
ol' thing" (motioning towards his Caprice police cruiser) He laughs and then
asks if I'd had a ticket before in this car and I told him "Yes, about 2
years ago in this exact same spot...it was for 82 mph too.(it's true)  He
laughed and said "well, just be carefull"  I thanked him. He was a nice
officer really. And it's like he understood. I think it's the Porsche
mystique, and the fact that it's the marque you dream of owning as a kid,
that softens the heart of anyone capable of understanding a passion for
driving.
And boy, I've got it bad!                  

Sorry about the long story.
