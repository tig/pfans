It seems to me that there are several discrete issues, to whit:

1) REGULAR MAINTENANCE:
Yes, parts are somewhat more expensive than new, say, Hondas.  I just
replaced the A/C compressor & some minor associated parts (all new,
aftermarket) for $850.  This included my excellent mechanic's $50/hour rates.
 I don't know what a contemporary mondobox costs, but I daresay it wouldn't
be less than about $500.  Yes, some/many Porsche parts are more expensive,
our skilled mechanics sometimes charge a slightly higher rate than a
dealership's low-skilled parts swappers, and the 928's complexity/density
requires more time for some/many repairs.  Nonetheless, this is NOT the
PRINCIPAL source of the 928's higher operating/maintenance costs.

2) MECHANICAL, COACHWORK, WEAR ITEMS:
The 928's principal mechanical parts are massive, understressed & built to
last well beyond what most manufacturers consider acceptable... IF PROPERLY
MAINTAINED.  The aluminum & galvanized chassis parts will last damn near
forever.  Most problems are due to: a) Improper service/maintenance (e.g.,
misalignment of two-plate clutches), b) Improper service/maintenance (e.g.,
by ill-informed mechanics or owners looking for cheap dodges or incorrect
fixes), c) Failure to follow proper maintenance schedules (oil, belt changes,
etc.), d) Operating extremes, like competition, without adequate compensatory
maintenance changes, e) Bad/clumsy driving.  A 928 that has been properly
maintained WILL NOT suffer these problems or incur grossly higher costs than
other relatively complex, high performance cars!

3) ACCESSORIES, ELECTRONIC & MECHANICAL SUB-SYSTEMS:
Here's the REAL rub.  Porsche enginers put enough bells & whistles into these
things to run the space shuttle.  The miles of wires, relays,
inter-related/connected vacuum systems, remote controls, sensors, etc. are
the source of most 928 problems.  The quality of both the design and the
parts in these systems is far below that of the basic mechanical parts.
 Wiring, connectors, levers, motors, etc. are all well below the quality of
similar Japanese & current American standards.  Access for diagnostic work or
replacement sucks.  This stuff will fail regularly or, worse, intermittently
and without apparent reason (vide, "magic blower syndrome").  Nothing an
owner can do will prevent this!  Even the most experienced mechanics will
exacerbate this!  Chasing these glitches will lead to
unnecessary/experimental/expensive parts swapping.  My solution, assuming a
reasonable sense of economic survival, is to ignore stuff that doesn't
matter.  Remote trunk release inoperative/intermittent?  Use the key!  Cruise
control kaput?  So what?  Intensive washers out?  Use a rag.  And on & on.
 When the beast passes 1/4 million miles rip this stuff out & enjoy THE CAR
which, underneath its country club trappings, is what it's all about anyway!

The next few years will see an increasing interest in used 928s.
 Ill-informed mythology has driven prices down, creating a situation where
may are bought by people unable to pay for the truly necessary maintenance,
or unwilling to financially justify "pouring good money after bad."  This
downward spiral will continue if prices of "good" (i.e., adequately
maintained) 928's plummet much below, say, $9-$10k.  I'm not trying to say
"last one in please close the door" (i.e., the good deals WE got!), but a
good condition 83-86 SHOULD be able to command prices in the mid-teens.  If
not, the quality of aftermarket parts and quality service for OUR cars will
begin to disappear, insurance companies will total after fender benders, etc.
 What can we do, as a group of committed owners, to support the resonable
prices needed to keep the "savable" 928s running (assuming that roughly
one-third/quarter of the 60,000-ish 928s built are now already beyond hope)?

Comments, discussion?

P.S.
Sorry for running on here, but I'm seeing red when the Kelly Blue Book list
the trade-in value of an "excellent" 1986 as $8,275!
