Storing for the winter season is a relatively straight-forward.  I've
stored various model 928s for about 10 years with no troubles.  Our
local PCA magazine has a very good annual article about storing.  When I
see it I'll check about posting it or perhaps getting it added to the
FAQ.  In the meantime, here's the basics that I observe:

1) Add a fuel stabilizer - I believe the brand name "Sta-bil" is the
standard.  I've heard different recommendations on how full to keep the
tank but try to keep at least a half-tank full of gas.  Add appropriate
amount of stabilizer.
2) Remove battery.  Keep in warm place and charge periodically
3) Plug engine/exhaust openings with steel wool - you don't want mice
creating a nest in your air filter box (like I had last winter) -
obviously I didn't follow this advice last year :-(
4) Good exterior washing - make sure good and dry before storing.  If
storing indoors then use a flannel car cover (it breathes).  I'm not
sure what to recommend for outdoor storing.
5) Relax doors, hatch, and wipers.  This is to avoid compression of the
seals. Shut doors to first stop position.  Put a wood block under your
wipers to keep off the glass.

That's basically what I do before storing.  In the spring I get the oil
and coolant changed as soon as I can.  I also change brake fluid every
other year.

Starting it the first time in the spring used to be a problem for me
before I bought a good battery charger with a 50 amp starter in it.  I
charge the battery good before replacing it in the car and then I start
the car with the charger hooked up.  I flip the switch on the charger
for the "start" mode and start the car.  It starts right up - and what a
wonderful feeling that is too :-)
