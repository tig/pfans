Just a few thoughts on the club idea............

Initiating a club can be done in two ways:   1  =  Interested parties
meet and select (elect) officers who in turn set up bylaws and
structure.  Just like family reunions!    2 = An individual creates the
structure and runs it like a small business.

Both can be effective.   However, it takes considerable resources to
execute the structure.   Publishing the newsletter, handling
correspondence, website management (?), meet setup, and sundry
activities all demand tremendous TIME commitment.   That's why many
enthusiast clubs today are basically businesses set up so that a paid
staff can manage them.

Anyhow, there are many organizations that can be modelled.  PCA is an
excellent example, but we do not have a constituancy capable of
generating the cash flow of a major club.  All it takes is someone with
the interest and time to gather a handful of other interested parties
and take it from there.  There is no reason a simple and informal club
would not serve most of our needs.

Who's next?
