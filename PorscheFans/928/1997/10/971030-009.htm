Is there any way to review all of the 928 archives without the obvious pain
of going into the archives on a day-by-day basis?  This is way too time
consuming.  It'd be nice to "scroll" though from one day to the next.  Any
ideas?

Does anyone know how large the wheel diameter a 928S4 will accept with
matching tires?  It would be OK if the front wheels had a smaller dia. than
the rears.  I would like to put 20-inchers on, but there aren't any tires
that have a suffciently low profile in order to maintain the correct overall
diameter.  Regarding width, what will really fit under those fenders without
rubbing?  And what wheel width/offset/backspacing is required in order to get
those tires to fit?  And who makes those wheels, or can make them?  I would
prefer non-custom wheels (less expensive), but I know that custom wheels may
be the only option.

A little editorial
928s seem to be well built (it's incredible how rattle-free my 10-year old
car is), but the Germans haven't the vaguest idea how to design/manufacture
interior plastic components which don't self destruct - like auto shifter
T-handles that cost $475 to replace, dash temp sensor edges, cracked/broken
armrest attachments, cracking dashes, broken seat release handles, shrinking
rear interior quarter panels, and on and on.  When was the last time you saw
a cacked dash, even on a piece of Detroit iron?...at least 20 to 30 years
ago.  But it's "normal" on a Porsche...give me a break!  I personally don't
know of any other car that requires a steering rack at 50k miles and no one
seems to think that's unusual!  If this was any other car brand, I believe
that buyers would be storming the gates at Porsche, but Porsche fans are so
loyal that it seems that they will stoically endure all problems.  The one
that cracks me up is how you will read glowing reports about 911s lasting a
quarter-million miles or more, but of course the engine has been rebuilt
three times, all the ancillary components replaced once or twice, etc. ,etc. 

Every time I replace a component (mechanical, electrical or cosmetic), and I
try to save a few bucks by purchasing used, the typical answer I receive from
Porsche/928 parts purveyors is, "We don't have XYZ part, they all break,
you'll have to get a new one from Porsche or a rebuilt one."  To add insult
to injury, you'd think that after all of those years manufacturing a car
virtually unchanged that the factory would've got the hint that some of these
parts could be substantially improved, or at the very least reduce the cost
of replacements if they're going to fail all the time requiring the customer
to become best friends with the parts department.

Also, while I'm at it, people call Lucas the Prince of darkness, but my XJS
is a LOT more reliable electrically than my 928.  Lucas may be the Prince,
but Bosch is the King!  Just about EVERYONE I talk to has mysterious
electrical gremlins that defy belief, and switches that give up the ghost all
the time.

BUT....the car is still a lot of fun to drive...much better than my XJS!!!

(Sorry for the tirade)
