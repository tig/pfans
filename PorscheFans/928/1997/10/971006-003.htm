This is from Gene O'Rourke : abeo@worldnet.att.net, I'll be away from
my computer in Florida until the end of Oct. but if anyone wants to 
contact me on this car I can be reached at 401-781-6137 until then.

I looked at and drove an 86S five speed yesterday in Connecticut.  Red/
black; apparently always garaged as the car looks like new.  This young 
guy that owns it, paid 14,000 for it last year.  At the time of purchase
it had 59 thousand miles on it.  It now has 72,300.  He's getting married 
and the Porsche has to go so he can buy a house.  He still owes 11,300
on it and will sell it for that amount just to get clear of the bank
loan.

It drives like a new car.  Brakes and clutch both feel strong.  Good 
rubber and the engine compartment looks clean .  He bought it from a 
dealer and doesn't know the history.  He's never spent a dime on it
so doesn't know if the 60 thousand mile tuneup haas been done.  I asked 
him if he knew whether the original timing belt had been changed and he 
knew nothing about it.  From all appearances however, the car has been 
well cared for.

If anyone is interested contact me at the R.I. phone listed above.  
There's no aanswering machine on it but I'll be there mosst of the time 
for the next two or three weeks.

Gene O'Rourke
