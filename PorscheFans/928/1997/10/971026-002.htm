Can I take you all on my first 6-liter ride?    No, I didn't strokerize
the GT but was lucky enough to stop by the Devek shop today and ran into
our Troy with his Bionic GT...

Just seeing those 'phat' dual pipes sticking out the rear was enough to
raise my blood pressure.  Looking underneath I found some of the nicest
large diameter pipes, welds, H-pipe and Flowmasters around.  Troy fired
it up and let me tell you the exhaust clearly barked out this is not
your everyday 928!  Marc sure balances those motors good as each
throttle blip brought instantaneous, torque laden revs.  Major WOOM!
WOOM!

We moved out and heads were checking mirrors already to see if Nascar
had moved their venue to the streets...  This car has pull up the ying
yang - take your S4 power band and multiply it by 1.5x across the
board!  Just when you thought it couldn't get any better the car turns
into a g-machine on the loops...  Hell, I had to hang onto the
doorhandle with both hands!  What lean?   Troy reports this machine
corners so hard that fuel management in the gas tank is required, even
straightaways can starve the pump, and I fully believe him.

But wait, there's more!  Back at the shop, Troy hands me the key and
sends me on my way solo!  What the ?  Oh man hit the freeway and start
heading towards Jim's place in San Jose!!!  I'm just a roaring down the
road freaking out on the incredible roll-on (more like blast off).
Acceleration more like a hyperbike than car.  The faster you go, the
faster you better be thinking as this car gets there faster than you can
imagine.  A sneaky fast too that comes on in a rush when the car gets on
cam - you're gone!  Did I say this car is fast?   I'm blipping the
throttle just to hear that great engine respond...

About to Mountain View I come to my senses, aided by just about every
known radar detector known to man that's hanging from the roof going off
in unison!  Cops?  Scan the mirrors, look for planes, but no sign
anywhere this time whew.  Blip, downshift, here that rrrroooooaaarrrr
and settle down, stop being a menace!  U-turn back to Belmont and what
do I see, an early silver 928 - NAIL IT and catch up just so we both can
hear the exhaust!  Thumbs up to each other and before I know it I am
pulling into the shop parking lot...  a couple last blips for good
measure and flame off...  quiet silence... what a thrill ride.

Thanks for the ride Troy!  I gotta' get a videocam!!!
Phil
