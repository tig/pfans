Thank you to all who replied to my questions on storage.  After reading 
the recent thread USA/EURO it left me with a couple of questions.  I
have 79 5sp.  What would it take to make it a 300hp, stiffer handling
EURO/S model?  I don't even have 928 on it.  I like it with just the
PORSCHE on the back of it.  People ask what model it is and I delight in
telling them it is a 928.  Back to the subject, does it take that much
to change over?  Did the body change in any significant way that would
make it impossible to change over or is it a matter of parts?  I love my
car but if I could make it to be more than it is with just a few upgrade 
items what's to stop me?  The underside of the car looks like it would 
support dual exausts.  Is that the way to go with headers?  I have the 
Devek info.  My ultimate goal is to make this car a sleeper(meaning no
one except you guys would know what this car is capable of).  I envy you
you guys with a 32v or a S4, GT can accomplish with your cars.  The
problem is I really love the design of the early cars.  Instead of
storage I'm going to restore my car.  I don't expect it to be the
fastest or best handling because realistically you can only (legally) go 
so fast on these hyways.  Although, I have had my car up to 140.  What a 
rush!  I am just lucky to finally take my own advice (life is short,
have fun).  Driving my dream car makes makes me more than happy.  thanks 
for letting me ramble.

-Subject: PorscheFans subscription info and FAQ
-From: <info@PorscheFans.com>

Welcome to PorscheFans!

For an easy way to join, leave, etc. a list, visit the PorscheFans web site at http://www.PorscheFans.com/.  All Porsche related questions should be posted the appropriate list.

If there are list errors or you have an administrative problem with a list, you can send an e-mail to listmaster@PorscheFans.com.  Please include the list you are having a problem with, and a detailed explanation.  DO NOT send Porsche related questions to the listmaster!  Please address them to the appropriate list.

The following PorscheFans lists are available:

    General     Anything relating to Porsches, but not a specific model
    356         Porsche 356 and 912 Engine
    911         Porsche 911 and 993
    914         Porsche 914
    924-944     Porsche 924, 944 and 968
    928         Porsche 928

=========================
SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION:
=========================

The easiest way to join, leave, etc. a list is via the PorscheFans web site at http://www.PorscheFans.com/.  To go directly to the subscription page, surf to http://www.PorscheFans.com/Subscribe.html

There are two ways to get the messages from PorscheFans: digest or non-digest.  We recommend DIGEST mode.  This sends you a daily collection (or "digest") of all messages for that list.  Not only does a digest keep your in-box from getting REALLY cluttered, and it drastically reduces the load on our mail server.  Digests are compiled and sent out at midnight, Pacific time.  Non-digest mode means you get an e-mail EVERY TIME someone posts a message to the list you are on.

If you are already a member of PorscheFans, and you want to switch your subscription from regular to digest (or vice versa), you don't have to quit the list.  Just send either a JOIN (to switch to regular mode) or a DIGEST (to switch to digest mode), and your subscription will be changed.

If you try joining a list that you are already a member of, you are politely notified that you are already a member.  So sending multiple join requests doesn't subscribe you multiple times.  Just one per customer (or e-mailbox).

It is NOT necessary to specify your e-mail address in the message to subscribe@PorscheFans.com -- the sender of the message is the one subscribed.  If you specify a different e-mail address than the sender, the address specified is subscribed, not the sender.

Messages sent to subscribe@PorscheFans.com are automatically processed.  So don't send any questions to this mail address, as they are never viewed by human eyes.  The subject of these messages is ignored.

None of the e-mail addresses or subscription commands are case-sensitive.  Sending a message to SUBSCRIBE@PorscheFans.com is exactly the same as sending a message to subscribe@porschefans.com.

NOTE: If you are joining multiple lists, please make sure that each request is on a line by itself, and that there are NO BLANK LINES between the requests.  The automatic subscription processor ignores everything after the first blank line.  We also recommend that you put at least one blank space at the beginning of the line, as some e-mail software word-wraps outgoing text.  Only the first subscription request on a line is processed.

---------------------------
SUBSCRIBING IN DIGEST MODE:

To get a daily digest of a list, send an email message to subscribe@PorscheFans.com with the body:
    digest <name-of-list>
For example:
    digest 356
To join all the lists, send an e-mail message to subscribe@PorscheFans.com with this in the body of the message:
    digest General
    digest 356
    digest 911
    digest 914
    digest 924-944
    digest 928
    digest Boxster
    digest Racing
    digest Flamers
    digest Tavern

-------------------------------
SUBSCRIBING IN NON-DIGEST MODE:

To join any of these lists, send an email message to subscribe@PorscheFans.com with the body:
    join <name-of-list>

For example:
    join 356

To join all the lists, send an e-mail message to subscribe@PorscheFans.com with this in the body of the message:
    join General
    join 356
    join 911
    join 914
    join 924-944
    join 928
    join Boxster
    join Racing
    join Flamers
    join Tavern

-----------------------------
CANCELLING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION:

To leave this list (either regular or digest mode), send an email message to subscribe@PorscheFans.com with the message:
    leave <name-of-list>
For example:
    leave 356

If your email address has changed since you joined, you can append your original email address:
    leave 356 <old-email-address>
For example:
    leave 356 joeschmo@doe.com

------------------------------------------
CHANGING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION E-MAIL ADDRESS:

To change where your subscription is being sent (for example, if your e-mail address has changed), you must un-subscribe from the list with your old e-mail address and re-subscribe with the new one.

For example:
    leave  356 joeschmo@doe.com
    digest 356 joeschmo@test.com

This can easily be done from our web page at http://www.PorscheFans.com/Subscribe.html

=========================
SUBSCRIPTION SUSPENSIONS:
=========================

The PorscheFans list processor will suspend your account automatically if it was not able to deliver to your mailbox after three days.  To re-activate your subscription, you must go through the subscription process again.

===========================
POSTING A MESSAGE TO A LIST
===========================

To send a message to the list, send an email message to
    <name-of-list>@PorscheFans.com
For example, send an e-mail message to:
    Boxster@PorscheFans.com

You will automatically receive a confirmation when your message has been received.
