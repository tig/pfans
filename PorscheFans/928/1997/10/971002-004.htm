Actually, you don't need the clutch to drive.  A lot of truckers use the
clutch just to get rolling, let up on the accelerator (to take the load off
the gears), shift into neutral, adjust engine speed and slip the shift
lever into the next higher gear.  Same procedure for downshifting.  If the
clutch fails completely just remember to shift into neutral before you
stop.  Then to get rolling turn off the engine, put it in low, and use the
starter motor.  Or at least this worked fine in my old IH farm truck.
