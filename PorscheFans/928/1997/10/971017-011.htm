     This may be true for 89, but my 91 GT does NOT have the 639 M code. I 
     beleive the GT is captured in the serial number. Of course my car has 
     the model designation delete option but it does have the M28/47 engine 
     (326hp) and the G28/55 transmission (5-speed w/PSD and 2.73:1 ratio).
     I beleive my car is a GT. 
     
     Here is a question for documentation specialists: Since my car was a 
     factory demo car (Porsche Executive Car as they refer to it), I 
     received a Porsche Certificate of Origin when I bought my car last 
     May. This included Date, Invoice #, VIN #, Year, Make, Body Type, 
     Shipping Weight, HP, # of cylinders, and Series or Model. Under the 
     Series or Model description was 928940. Does anyone know what this 
     refers to?
