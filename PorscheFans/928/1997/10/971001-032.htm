<<Has anyone had experience with a bra?  does it fade the paint? what about

scratching the paint from rubbing against the car?  Brian what is your

recommendation?>>

If I am the Brian you were asking then I would say go with a bra.  But only
buy one that is of the highest quality and specifically made for your year
928.  Using them for trips is fine, but I wouldn't leave it on around town
(orelse it will fade paint).  Keep your entire front end waxed well and wash
the bra whenver it gets wet or shows signs of dirt.  Put it in the washing
machine on med heat with NO DETERGENT and let air dry.  Any dirt that is on
the bra will be rubbing into your paint as you drive.  I don't use a bra on
either of my Porsche's, but I probably should.  Bugs and paint do not mix
well.
Regards,
Brian
