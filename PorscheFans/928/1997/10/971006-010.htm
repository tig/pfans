Right.

Some more thoughts on this:
Roll the window down....look inside and you will see the two Allen bolts =
that hold the=20
window guides (under rubber trim...on top...you really need to remove =
the door panel
to get to it).    It is possible that one of the guides came loose and =
needs to be re-
adjusted and tightened (they slide back and forth to put different =
degrees of pressure on the window).=20

On mine...the felt/rubber cover had broke loose off the window guide =
bracket...so it
needed replaced.  I also recall also that the part was expensive for =
such a simple
thing,  my cheap/quick fix:

1.  Cut piece of rubber hose the width of window guide bracket (around =
3/4 inch).=20
Cut that piece to fit the window guide bracket (around 45 degrees of =
circle...small
piece...but the hose has the curvature to match the original guide =
"bumper").

2.  Tape piece of hose to window guide bracket with electrical tape.

3.  Stick a piece of Velcro(soft side) on outside of electrical tape =
where bumper=20
contacts window.

When you re-install the guide make sure that it pushes against the =
window enough to
keep it from wobbling on the way up....and so that it seals properly =
when shut.
