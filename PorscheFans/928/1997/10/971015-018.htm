Hire one.  If you arent' getting any satisfaction by now, you are not likely
to get any.  Do you have copies of the contracts, did you get the driver to
sign off on all of the intransit damage, do you have the inspection sheet
from load time, have they specifically denied any liability, did you pay them
or Lucky, did he pay with check or credit card, was the car otherwise
insured, ETC....

These are some of the questions that go into analyzing the viability of a
claim against the shipper.  It is likely that you haven't spoken with the
right person at that company yet.  You need to get very aggresive RIGHT NOW,
time is your enemy.  

I have had good and bad experiences, all with the same company.  I always
dealt directly with the owner, or his son, and all damages were promptly
fixed.  On the larger problem I got him three estimates, and settled for an
appropriate amount.  

All of these truckers claim policies are governed by the P.U.C., or whoever
licenses them in those parts.  They have strict, timelined, rules that you
must meet in order to have a valid claim.  I would suggest you contact
someone that deals with freight claims often, you will spend less by hiring
someone that is experienced right from the start.  I would imagine that the
company that you are dealing with is self insured, and either administrates
the insurance themselves or pays an insurance company to administer their
claims.  You may be able to solve this with a couple of simple letters and
phone calls.  But START NOW.

Subject: Shipping a Car X-Country

I'd like to hear from anyone that has experience in shipping a car
across
the country as I might be doing that soon.  Specifically, Virginia to
Seattle.  Names and telephone numbers of trucking firms that specialize
in this kind of thing would be appreciated.

****

Hi Tom:

I kind of have a tale of woe on x-country but hopefully it won't be your
experience:

My GT was trucked from Columbus, OH to SF, CA by D&D Trucking.

At load time (I wasn't there) special instructions and wooden blocks
provided to load the 928.  Unfortunately for me, when I went to pick up
the car in SF, it was already unloaded with the front spoiler completely
torn off and sitting in the hatch, soiling the rear seatbacks and rear
carpet.  As you may or may not know, on the GT, the front spoiler's rear
mounting points attach to the oil cooler.  So yes, in tearing off my
front spoiler, all those rear mounting tabs were destroyed as well.
Thankfully the cooler has no leaks.  Additionally, the spoiler mounts to
various points on the inner fender wells, so those mounting holes were
cracked and torn too.

To continue this travesty, some of the paint on the nose of the car had
been rubbed raw - an obvious sign that either the GT or the car in front
of it had not been secured properly and the two cars rubbed during
transit.

I gave the company written notice within their allotted time frame and
followed up with supporting documents via registered mail but to date I
have received no response from them.  I wonder if they'll respond now
that they've lost 800+ potential customers.  D&D Trucking  gave Lucky
every guarantee that the car would be fully insured against damage but
they are turning out to be just flakes.

Hello fellow "Land Shark tamers":

928 Frenzy Polo Shirts are still available. The color is "Ash" with black
collar and cuffs. The accent color is teal as is the profiled 928S in the
logo. The price in cluding shipping and handling is: $35 for M & L, and $37
fro XL & XXL. Contact me at: eds928s@erols.com for where to send your
check(s).

I would like to hear from folks on the topic of tire pressures for the 928.
As you should know the recommended tire pressure is on a label on the inside
of the fuel filler cover. On my 86 the recommended pressures are: 36 psi for
the fronts and 44 psi for the rears.

With over seven years of driving a 928, and having replaced four sets of
tires,I can say that those pressures are designed to make sure the car
understeers whenever one drives near the limits of adhesion. Over the years
I have noticed certain tell-tail signs as to what the pressures should be
(at least for me). First, as my tires wear down the fronts show excessive
wear on the edges but still good tread in the center. This usually means
"underinflation". Second, the rears wear out in the center first which
usually means "overinflation".

I now run the pressures at 40 psi all around and find that the tires wear
much more evenly. Also, there is considerably less understeer. However, the
likelyhood of going to oversteer is increased accordingly. I caution
everyone that decides to try my set up about the oversteer aspect.

Good luck and happy motoring. Ed

My 1983S stereo has "heard" better days.  Does anyone have suggestions on a
good deck replacement with CD. . .and speaker sizing (this question is key -
I want to utilize the factory grilles - especially the "subwoofer"
grilles.).  I will commit up to $500 to materials, and do the work myself.

How do I know if the factory "subwoofers" are any good. . .the whole stereo
just sounds crappy and has little power.

Subject: Re: on-car tire balancing 

Thought I'd chime in on this thread.

On-car balancing is a good tool to have in your hip pocket for 
situations *real* tire balancing doesn't work.

A *real* off-car dynamic balance job balances the tire/wheel about
3 axis rather than the single axis of your car's axel. A tire that
does not shake at speed may pull and make the car feel out of 
alignment.

If an on-car balance cures problems an off-car balance couldn't, then
you were balancing the wrong thing in the first place. I'd guess your
brake rotors are out of balance.

I had a car on jack stands for a number of years, without wheels
mounted. Developed a nice pile of rust dust under each brake rotor
where the rotors simply fell apart. In a heated garage. Tapping the
rotors caused even more rust to fall out.

As big as the 928's brakes are, it wouldn't take much unbalance to
cause problems. Look inside your front 928 rotors, mine have balance
weights.

For starters, a visual inspection is needed. My puny 3.5" fronts still
made noises but on inspection the surrounding foam suspension was dust.

A $30 pair of Pioneer blues are infinitely better. Not audiophile.

Mike,

I have an '88 SE - the fore-runner to the GT - which has done 97,000 miles
and is still tight as a drum.  Coming from a long history of British sports
cars that rattle I can't believe how good this old beast still is and how
strong the engine and gearbox are.  I bought it about a year ago with 89,000
miles on the clock  and had it pretty thoroughly checked out,  spending
another 5 grand on tyres, brakes and the normal 928 niggly faults (rear
hatch release, interior light...) and then went out and drove it like
they're meant to be driven.

I used it everyday for a few months, but this came to an end when someone
dropped a sledgehammer off a truck in front of me and took out the
undertray, air-con, steering bushes and miscellaneous other small items.  I
bought a 205GTi as a town car and now the 928 only gets driven when I need
the adrenaline.  (Most weekends.)

Apart from an alternator pulley coming loose last Christmas (causing the
dash to, appropriately,  light up like a Christmas tree) it hasn't missed a
beat.  I've had it around the circuit, 140mph down the back straight and
braking from 100m for the hairpin from that speed.  Unlike my Lotuses the
928 still had plenty of oil pressure and wasn't running more than 5 degrees
above normal at the end of 15 laps.

It's pure magic!

<<By the way, an update on the stuck seat problem. I took apart the cable
as suggested and found out which side was stuck. I then applied a little
torque on the cable on the stuck side with a wrench and the seat came
free ! Unfortunately, the fore / aft seat switch only goes aft, so it's
next on the list for replacement.

Hey Dave-

Can you give a little more detail.  As to the wrench, what kind; as to the
"coming free", was it abrupt, gradual, did you have to pull on the seat, what
side was it, etc.?

 Man, I got so sick of dealing with the plastic-lined ball-joint at the 
top of the torque tube that I re-engineered the whole thing.  I also had 
problems breaking the small threaded shaft between the ball-joint cup 
itself and the rod.  Both of these problems were due to very hard 
shifting (going into 3rd), mostly on the track, but several times on the 
street.  Eventually the darn thing will pop out due to wear.
 Anyway, my fix was to take a piece of 1.5-2" diamater/3-4" long Teflon 
square stock and machine a hole longitudinally slightly larger than the 
shift link itself. I also machined a shallow curve on one side to mate up 
against the torque tube.  Then I took the ball-joint off, slid the Teflon 
bushing down, then re-attach the ball-joint.
 Now I needed to secure the Teflon bushing, so I took two very long SS 
hose clamps and clamped the heck out of the bushing to the torque tube 
(clamps go around the torque-tube).  To further stabilize the it, I JB 
Welded a couple of "stops" onto the torque tube, on each side of the 
bushing.  I did not bother putting any lube on it, since it was Teflon.  
Now I can shift as hard as I want with no fear of popping the ball-joint 
out, and my shifts are more precise.

No. Your instruments are metric because that's the law in Canada (can't
even have a concentric mph ring on the speedo). All Porsche chassis have
the VIN with ZZZ regardless of where in the world the car is delivered. The
stuff which makes the car a US model is less basic. The VIN on the door
panel, which presumably includes JAO or JBO, is correct. Eh?
