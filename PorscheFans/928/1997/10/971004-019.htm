	Hello all.  I just got back from Louisville and the PCA event I posted info
about.  All I can say is "what a blast!"  At least as much fun as last year
with even better weather.  I even got to meet Greg Schickel (from this list)
and his 928S4.  Couldn't hope to meet a nicer guy, and his 928 is beautiful
(all of you who went to the first annual Shark Frenzy know that though).  He
and I hung out all day, had a great lunch together, and traded info/opinions
on wine, cigars, life, and of course Porsches with a lot of interesting
Porsche owners.
	A few standout cars of the 50+ in attendance were my 930 (of course), two
red RS Americas, a 79 930 slantnose, a 95 928 GTS, Greg's super-clean S4, a
red 94 968, and many various years of 911 targas/coupes/cabs.  The best part
of the entire day was the drive to and from the winery.  There is nothing
like seeing the expressions on people's faces when they see a line of 15+
detailed Porsches (KY region cars on the way there) roll past them.  That and
screaming around 20 mph corners on tree lined country backroads at 60 mph
really plastered a smile on my face for the entire day.  Being a part of an
event such as this and feeling the camaraderie from a group of people that
enjoy their Porsches as much as I enjoy mine is part of what owning a Porsche
is all about.  Not every car there was low mileage or in concours condition,
but every car there was a work of art and special in it's own right.
	However, there was one unfortunate accident.  A gentleman from the KY region
had parked his blue 74 (?) 911 Targa in a row of cars that was above (behind)
two other rows of cars.  He must have left his parking brake off and his car
in neutral b/c a few minutes (which is the weird part) after he got out of
the car it rolled down the hill and BETWEEN two parked 911's.  Greg can
attest to this, but the space between the two parked cars was so small that
you would never imagine that there was any way that a car could fit in
between them.  Unfortunately there wasn't, because an original 911 Carrera RS
(the car on the right) was sideswiped ever so lightly.  I have pictures to
prove this (which will be developed and scanned in short order), but if a 911
Carrera is 4 foot wide there was only 4 feet and 1/4 inch in between the two
parked cars.  Even though some damage was done it's absolutely amazing that
nothing more happened.  What's just as amazing though is that the 7 guys that
jumped on the rolling 911 kept it from totalling out an 89 944 Turbo S and
then proceed to immerse both itself and the 944 in the lake.  A slight
blemish on an otherwise perfect day.
Hopefully more of you can make it next year!
