Hi Porschefans

  Got back from a week off and I'm just catching up with all the activity
on the digest. Lots of stuff going on, and a have a few cents to add to 
several topics. 

  First off let me share with you my track experience from this weekend. 
As I had posted earlier my wife and I went with the BMW club to their
driver's school held at Buttonwillow raceway. Too bad no other 928 took
up the chance to join us. As usual it involved a lot of work but it was
a blast. I have to congratulate the BMW club for putting on such a well 
organized event. (I've never been to a PCA event, so I can't compare)
The instructors that we had were very good and definitelly learned a lot
from them. No matter how many times you go to the track you always come
back knowing more about driving, about your car, and about yourself.

   I guess it's my turn to be track cheerleader. I'ts hard to convey just
how much fun this can be. I have yet to find someone who went to one of
these events and didn't think it was worth it. For those of you who've
writing about stop light racing try this instead: 
  
   You drive down the straightaway, accelerator is on the floor and
the RPMs are quicky reaching redline. You shift into fourth and smoothly 
get back on full throttle. This is the easy part, as the speed soars past 
a 100, you check your mirrors your gauges and take a few breaths to settle 
down. You line the car up on the left side of the track to enter the big
rigth hand sweeper. Squeeze the brakes to drop some speed and settle the 
car for the entrace. Feed in a little steering and as the weight transfers 
to load the ouside tires you set the steering wheel to take you trough the
turn. Right away the street tires begin to squeal for mercy. Instead you 
begin to give it more gas. You look down the track at the apex cone that's
some 600 feet away and make minute adjustments. More gas, more gas, you 
feel the inside wheels just kiss the burm as your accelerator hits the floor.
At this point you are commited to the turn, your car is in a four wheel drift
as momentum carries you to the ouside edge of the track. The 40 foot width
of the track is quickly becoming nothing but a few inches between your outside
wheels and the dirt beyond. Your lizard brain tells you to slow down, but 
you know the only thing keeping that rear end from coming arround you is 
that floored accelerator. You exit carrying more speed than the previous 20
times you tried it and you know it was just perfect --YEEHAAA  :)

   Sorry, I got carried away there. After 2 days of this kind of driving
no street contest will seem worth the effort. Hey, but to each his own.

   Next stop, Laguna Seca Nov 9 &10. 

Now for the disclaimer: The surgeon general has declared that track events
are dangerous and addictive, you've been warned.
