<excerpt><fontfamily><param>Monaco</param><smaller>Having driven 3
different 928s before settling on this one, I noticed that the ride is
noticably harder in the one I'm buying than it is in the other 2.
Preferring a ride that is not quite so hard, I'm wondering if anyone
knows what might cause the difference. Was there a competition suspension
offered in '88? Can softer shocks be installed on such a suspension?
Anything known on this subject would be greatly appreciated.

Check the build sticker on your nice new car (instructions on Phil Tong's
Web site at http://www.928s4vr.com/; go to the "Option Codes" page. If
you find 474 among the codes, you have the optional sport shocks, which
are quite a bit stiffer than the standard units. If you have these and
don't like them, they can be swapped.


<excerpt><fontfamily><param>Monaco</param><smaller>My second question
relates to Leonard's car. I remember that several months ago ne mentioned
getting a custom programmed chip for his 928 somewhere on Long Island. As
I hope to "chip" my 928 as well, could I ask where that was and what they
did?

Autosport Designs (http://www.smarttrac.com/autosport/index.htm) put my
car on their chassis dyno, hooked up their computer to the car's fuel and
ignition computers, and proceeded interactively to reprogram both
computers from the ground up to optimize their operation to my taste
(keep the broad torque curve but raise it; sharpen throttle response) for
my specific engine (there are always unit-to-unit variations).


They found me about 50 bhp more without any loss of smoothness, fuel
economy, or any other desirable characteristic. This was done well over a
year ago and I remain most pleased.
