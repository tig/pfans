Yes on the auto, no on the stick. '89 S4s have the G 28.12, same as the
non-US '87-'88 S4s. The G 28.55 box goes with the '89 GT

I'd suggest changing the last column as follows (the G 28.10 is in non-us
'85-86 928 S cars):

	G 28.10/12/55
Ist	3.7645
2nd	2.5122
3rd	1.7900
4th	1.3541
5th	1.0000
Rev	3.3056
Final	2.7272 (G 28.10/55), 2.6363 (G 28.12)

2.357 final drive ratio was standard on A 28.05 (available on non-US or
Japan '85 928 S) and A 28.08 (available on non-US or Japan '86 928 S).
2.538 was standard on A 28.06 (available alternative on non-US or Japan '85
928 S), A 28.09 (standard on '86 928 S cars for Sweden and Switzerland), A
28.11 ('86 928 S for Australia), A 28.14 (non-US -87-88 S4), and A 28.16
('89 S4 worldwide)

Stall speed is the engine rpm at which the torque converter is doing the
most torque multiplication (typically around 2:1). This should be matched
to the engine's torque characteristics; higher stall speeds usually go with
more "tuned" engines which need to wind up higher before supplying lots of
torque (check the drag racers' choices, e.g.,
http://www.bmracing.com/catalog/fullline/pages/racesel.html).

However, as many on the list have noted, this combination does not give
great results off the line unless you wind up the engine to around this
speed with the brakes applied and then let go, a technique known for
accelerating the aging of torque converters.

Later cars produce more torque at low speeds and are happier with lower
stall speeds.
