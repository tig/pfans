  The factory workshop manuals specify attaching straps to the front sway
  bar to pull the car down when doing the alignment.  I didn't read all the 
  details, but I would assume that the idea is to pull down to obtain the 
  factory specified ride height.  This would be especially important when 
  moving the car from a lift to the alignment rack without driving the 
  (often long) distance needed to settle the suspension.
  
  Based on what the shop told you, I would guess that your car is presently
  1cm above ride height specs.  Sounds to me like you may have found one of
  those rare shops that actually knows how to properly align a 928.
