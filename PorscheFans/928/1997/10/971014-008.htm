<<Brian,

Which west-side shops have you had troubles with?

I have to get my beast fuel pressure-tested, and maybe a few other
things which are beyond my skills.

Might end up going to Alan, but trouble is, I have to somehow get there
after work, or on a weekend.>>

As far as west side, don't bother with I'm Service on Macadam.  They are the
ones that told me my fuel pump was "fried", and replaced it at a cost of
about $500 for the pump, filter, and labor.  I took the old parts, and the
fuel pump was fine.  Probably only the filter was clogged.  There is another
place on Grand or Union that does only Porsche / Audi, and while they do good
work, their prices don't compare to Alan at all.  I have a friend with a
black S4 that uses various people in Beaverton, who have treated him well.
 With the exception of some (in my opinion) skewed advice on repairs, and
outrageous parts prices.  I can get the names if you want them.

Alan works late most days, and comes in early as well.  I have also arranged
to drop off on Sat mornings in the past. He is the only one I have ever dealt
with that actually had 928's at his shop when I was there.  And not just one
or two, usually several.

What car are we talking about, by the way?

Let me know if you want the names of others in Beaverton.
