I finally fixed the cold start problem on my 85. Well the dealer did 
actually. After checking just about everything that could possibly be 
checked I figured it must be the MAF sensor or the computer. I was 
pondering my options when the car decided not to start at all. I spent a 
while making sure the injection was injecting and the ignition was 
igniting etc. and things seemed to be fine. I decided to bite the bullet 
and get it on a flat bed up to the dealer. They poked around for a while 
before deciding the MAF sensor was causing the no start problem so I had 
to swallow the cost of a new one. Ouch, ouch ouch. That's one expensive 
sensor but, low and behold, the cold start problem is fixed as well and 
it runs about the best it ever has. I sure hope your cold start problem 
has a less expensive solution.
