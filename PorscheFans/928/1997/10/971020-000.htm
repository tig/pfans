Hi all,

I recently purchased a 1980 928 with 36500 miles on it and paid about
$8000.  Is this a reasonable price?  The car is in great shape inside and
out.  The drivers door seems to have been repaired but I believe it's
only from a minor dent.  The doors are solid and the body is straight.  I
also have a few other questions:

1. 	What can I do to get the fuel door to fit more flush with the
body?  The rubber piece that adjusts the level of the door is definitely
not the 		problem.  It seems to be the fuel cap.  It sticks
out slightly even when its screwed all way.

2.	Just yesterday, When I got home from a 150 mile trip, the brake
pressure warning light began to flash.  It did not start while I was
	driving but when I restarted the car.  What's wrong? It still
seems to have good stopping power and there are no leaks coming from
	the master cylinder and no puddles on the ground.  What causes
this light to come on and where is the problem? Is it a faulty sensor?
	Braking still feels normal.  Is there a reset switch?

Well that's all.  It's wonderful that there is so much loyalty to the 928
and I'm proud to say that I'm loyal also, as well as my girlfriend (also
a 928 owner).  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Damon,
