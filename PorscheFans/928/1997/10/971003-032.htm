Hi, David,
I have a 1990 928S4 with the PSD and was under the impression it worked they
way you described:brakeing the offending wheel.
But, after purchasing the car and obtaining the Service Information Book,
WKD469521, which describes the PSD system, I was enlightened.  It states its
an electrically controlled, hydraulically operated "rear axle transverse
locking differential lock". The system has its own hydraulic system including
pump, reservoir, fluid, etc. As you stated it uses the ABS system to sense
and calculate system operation. The "transverse lock slave cyliner" is
attached to the differential housing. It's output (through a "engaging arm")
modulates the preload on the clutch disc set similiar to that found in
traditional LSD's. 
Apparently, it is an actual variable LSD!
And it works GREAT. There is a dash mounted indicator light which illuminates
when the system is activated.

Thanks,
John Weber
