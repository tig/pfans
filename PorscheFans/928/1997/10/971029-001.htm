I have been reading a lot about timing belts on these engines.  I recently
sold my '90 Audi V-8 Quattro, which had a 4 litre engine that was
essentially the 928S engine reengineered for the Audi by Porsche.  I have
also had a couple of 944's, Audi 5000/200's, etc, all with ubiquitous belts.

Roger's #1 rule for belt mantainence is:  Whenever the car goes in for an
oil change, it gets completely checked.  Up in the air?  Go over the
underneath parts.  Timing belt?  Yeah, have the wrench look at it....look
for cracks, aging tension...just a quick look.  Just to be sure.

Yeah, sure.  Just the added check adds about an hour to the oil change
service, which I do at 5000 miles.  I go to Performance Plus in Old Orchard
Beach, Maine, and it costs, oh, I guess, another fifty bucks or so.  Cheap
insurance.

A number of years ago, I had a new, '79 BMW 320i, which was my daily
transportation.  IN those days, I was driving 3-600 miles per week.  When
that car was serviced (it was serviced at the dealer, BY THE BOOK), I told
them to make sure the car was FULLY checked EACH time it was in, regardless
if it was for oil change or full service.  I did not want the car to drop me
fifty miles from a telephone, at oh-dark-thirty and minus 25 degrees F.

One day during a "routine" oil change, the mechanic felt under the timing
chain top pulley, and an oil galley plug fell out in his hand.  It had been
working its way loose for forty-five thousand miles or so, and at that
precise moment, it let itself out.  Fifteen miles down the road, it could
have gone for a ride up over the camshaft, in the chain, and, God knows what
else.....destroyed the engine.  But it didn't, and I drove the car past 125k
before selling it in "as new" condition.

The lesson learned is that if there is one thing that can really ruin your
day, like a 928 timing belt failure, OVER CHECK IT.  If it means buying the
damn tool, and you really want to do all that yourself, then buy the damn
tool.  Me?  I want someone who does this sort of thing all the time to do
it.  I have too many other things to do with my 928 than work on
it......like drive it.  Season's short up here in the hustings, you know!

Regards,


Roger
