Hi everyone!

This is a resubmission of a message I sent out on the 30th.  Got the
confirmation back that it would be in the digest for 10/30, but it didn't
make it for some reason, so here we go again.

Although I'm happy with my '84 928S 5-speed I've been looking for a slightly
newer 928 automatic and may have found one in Tempe, Arizona.  Problem is, I
can't drive there until 2 weekends from now because I have to be able to get
back in case I don't buy the car and I need my wife to drive with me... but
she's busy this weekend.

So..  are any of you p-fans in or near Tempe willing to take a look at this
car for me and give me some feedback? 

If so, please e-mail me directly.  If someone's really gung-ho I'd be
willing to pay for a pre-purchase inspection and the time consumed --
certainly enough for a good dinner with a significant other.

Anyone interested??

John
'84 928S 5-speed
