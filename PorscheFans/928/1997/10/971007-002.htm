Several years ago I purchased a 1984 with manual transmission that had
tried to drive under the read end of a truck.  Lots of cosmetic damage, but
no structural damage.  Now we are about ready to put the car back on the
road.  However, other than an occassional start, it has not really been run.

Stephane has outlined a procedure for restarting, but suggested I ask the
group for comments on the valve springs.  We are going to go over the
engine with care before starting.  While we have everything open, does it
make any sense to replace the valve springs as a matter of course?  Or do
we just try to test them and replace only those springs that are apparently
bad?  I have heard conflicting advice.  What will be the damage if a spring
breaks?
