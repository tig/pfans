I bought me a 79 928, automatic, 69k miles in apparently very good
condition.  Purchased it from an elderly person who obviously could afford
the repairs and he had 10 years of records to verify it.  Said his wife has
been driving it back and forth to play golf a couple of times a week,
replaced it with a 911 (because my daughter had one) he said.

Anyway, passed smog flawlessly and excepting for an apparent (hopefully)
need to balance the tires, everything seems ok, almost.  The problem is the
keys/locks that operate the doors and ignition are evidently worn and only
work with an uncalled for amount of jiggling and pushing.  Once in the
ignition, everything works ok. Question is, any body in the San Diego, CA
area recommend someone I can contact to fix the problem.  I can forsee
getting locked out some time.  My local locksmith told me the cost to
replace the door cylinders would run anywhere from $35. to 125 depending
the luck they had with the lock, whethere or not they had to remove the
panel, didn't drop anything inside the door.  The flat out charge for the
ignition was $125.  I called another place in the Chula Vista area who from
the yellow pages purports to work on "foreign cars."  He said the ignition
lock could be replaced for $80.00.  I called Dieter's Porsche, a well known
independant Porsche repair facility in San Diego and he invited me by for a
look.

Anyway, at my age, the value of the vehicle is more cosmetic than
performance, I will never race or go very fast, ergo I settled for the 79
with automatic.  The car is particularly clean with fresh upholstry and a
stack of repair bills that seem to touch on most of the issues I have read
with this group.

I love to start that engine and get breezing along.  
thanks for all the advice I find with the group
Thanks again,
