This morning I got a little scare.  When i started the car, it ran rough,
and I heard what sounded like a valve tap or rod knock.  

Oil pressure was normal.  I also smelled a heavy gasoline smell.  As soon as
I took the car down the driveway, the problem cleared up, and it runs and
sounds normal.  Now I'm thinking that a fuel injector may have made the
sound.  Any opinions?  The car has only 24K miles on it, and I drive it
almost every day.  I got it two years ago with 9K.  Should I put in a bottle
of fuel injection cleaner?  

Last night it was fine when I started it for a brief time to take it out of
the garage, so I didn't think it would be a bearing knock that just
developed overnight.  At least I hope so.  


Thanks..   Mike Clemens
