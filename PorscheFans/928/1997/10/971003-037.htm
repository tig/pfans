James,

Reading your comments about the track really made me feel sane!  I live in
New Zealand and own a 1988 928SE.  It's a model most people haven't heard
of, but it's basically a British market clubsport with a couple of the
luxury items put back in and with the '89 GT spec motor and 5 speed box.

I took it around the local circuit (Pukekohe Raceway) a few weeks ago and
just came away totally in love with the beast.  Braking from 140 mph for the
hairpin INSIDE the 100m marker board was such a thrill!  I had similar
tail-out events to yours, and the car just seems to sort itself out. I have
never driven anything like it!!  (And I raced Lotus Sevens and a Lotus
Esprit for years.)  I got to the stage where I was getting around one
particular corner at just over 90mph with the rear out of line enough that
people were holding their breath, and I was doing it time after time.  It
just MAKES you a better driver, doesn't it.

And like you, I want to do it again! I want better tyres, perhaps a little
more horsepower (I have 330bhp), but even without those, I want to do it
again. SOON!!!

Regards,

Philip Adamson
