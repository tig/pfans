I'm currently running Bridgestone S02's in original 225/50 x 16 size on my
'85 S, and they really are superior to both the Michelin XGT's and the ZR
Comp TA's that I've had previously.  The drawback is, as you say, they're
very expensive, but their initial turn-in is far more crisp, and they are
much more reassuring in high-speed transitions - the car simply feels more
planted.  The sidewalls are much stiffer than the XGT's, so they're harder
riding, but they're much quieter than the Comp TA's.  They also seem to be
wearing better than the XGT's - about the same as the TA's in that respect,
I think.  12,000 km on this set so far with no rotation until this weekend.
 I think I'll stick with the S02's.

Cheers,
Dave Jorgensen
