Hey haven't enough beer-less fridays gone by yet?   Philip Eskilden
where are you?
Aaron Pultz ?  I lost yer number on one of those pieces of paper!

San Francisco is enjoying some of the most incredible Summer & Indian
Summer weather of all time!  So let's hope THIS FRIDAY will be more of
the same for beer night by the bay.  If anyone wants to save on the
shipping, I'll bring some logo t-shirts just let me know what size and
it's cash & carry.  I want to hear about all the cars that only saw 928
tail lights at the last AX!

Don't forget - safe, underground parking in the building is FREE when
you get the ticket stamped at Gordon Biersch!  Now featuring a full bar
along with the restaurant service...  Last week's band was an eclectic
punk Polka sound.  Needless to say I declined in participating in the
slam mosh macarena dance.  Strange yes, but this is San Francisco!

Hope to see you all there!
Phil
ps.  Aaron - pls call me again - If my car isn't back on the road by
friday I'm sure Jim wouldn't mind giving you a PHAT 928 S4-style bomb
run  :)
