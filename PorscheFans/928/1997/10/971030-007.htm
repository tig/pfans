Kurt,

Very nice set up you made for your taping efforts in the 928...A friend and I
did some of the same at Texas World Speedway this past Sept and we just took
a  camera mounted it on a tripod and then bungee corded (in a BIG kind of
way) that whole unit to the passenter side back seat, leaned the passenger
side front seat WAY back and viola!!  Instant (ok almost, it did take about
10 min to bungee it into the car) track video.  Now we are not nearly as fast
or experienced as you but we did ok.  We both drove in the Yellow run group
and I was passed by few people, but I have a long way to go before I really
feel like I am a good driver (amazing what a few trips to the track will do
to your ego! ;) ).

We did get a little bit of vibration and hitting about 130 or so made for
some terrible wind noise in my car, but the footage is pretty damn cool I
think.
