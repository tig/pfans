Hello all, 
Been away from the list for a few days, I'm glad to see the enthusiasm
regarding an Owners Club is building up steam. And yes, I'd like to help in
any way I can. 
Phil T.---you are one of our greatest driving forces. Thanks for all your
hard work.
Leonard, it seems you've been putting your superior intellect to good use by
laying out intents for our organization.

Phil, you say....

Leonard, you say....

From our conversations at the "Frenzy" I understood most people opting for
forming under the PCA, because they would be our best link to Porsche AG and
Porsche Cars North America. In fact, it was mentioned, that unless we could
be under the PCA somehow, that we would be best served by just continuing to
participate and promote the good things we've already got going here. 
Points can and have been made for both camps and these are things we have to
ponder. I believe it will more difficult to become an entity under the PCA,
but I think we can have a bigger impact in the 928 world and it will be
better for us in the long run. Also, I wouldn't want to alienate Kim Crumb
and the strides he's already made.  
Which reminds me, I spoke with him last week a few times, and he said Marc
Thomas is getting together a mailing list etc. I told him that I thought
Leonard, myself, and others would work on a mission statement of sorts. (been
gone a few days--I didn't know you all were gonna start without me) He asked
to be kept informed and is enthusiastic about it all. 

Ed, you say....
>At tonight's PCA Potomac region's monthly meeting I will be meeting Chuck
>Drake (PCA Zone 2 Rep) to get more information on maintaining an association
>with PCA and simultaniously becoming a "928 Club" or "registry". Chuck and I
>have already discussed this and he feels confident that an arrangement can
>be made. I'm not holding my breath, but I consider Chuck a "straight
>shooter" that's been with PCA for nearly 30 years and knowns his way around
>the organization.
>Since my posting on needing help to form the "928 Club", I have received
>several offers. Phil Tong has already gotten started with this on the west
>coast. I do not wish to re-invent the wheel, so we will coordinate our
>efforts to avoid duplication and redundancy

Leonard, you say....
>A number of us are moving as we speak to pull this club together; now is
>the time to express interest, offer services, and otherwise show the flag.

Ed, Thanks to you too. Keep us posted. ("928 Frenzy Drei" plans look
exciting)
Good sentiments about coordinating our efforts.
Please, Leonard, Ed, Phil, Brian, James, etc.....feel free to ask me for
help.

Brian, you say....
>Yes, count me in.  The only thing that I am concerned about is the fact that
>I am way over here in Southern IN and all the 928 get togethers are on the
>east and west coasts.  I guess Greg Schickel and I will just have to get
>together by ourselves!
> P.S. Greg - next time I go to Louisville I will call you in advance and we
>can grab dinner ... and yes I will drive the 928.

Yeh, let's get together...Give me a yell.

Phil, you say....
>Anyways, an internet chat is in order for whatever core group we can get
together
>and Doug Hampton recommended a nifty little program to me that I think we
can try
>(free ltd time beta).  It's called ICQ ( I seek you) at
http://www.mirabilis.com
>How about we set a date & time and agenda to get this going?

Great idea. Let's do it. 
 
Ok, I know this was a long post, just trying to catch up with everything
going on. 
Check out the Devek 928 in the newest issue of Excellence!  

Regards to all,
Greg Schickel    87'  5spd. Diamantblau Metallic
