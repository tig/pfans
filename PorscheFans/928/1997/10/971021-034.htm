Yep. Stats are as follows:
engine type	M 28.45
displacement	4957 cc
bore (mm)	100
stroke (mm)	78.9
hp (DIN)		288 @ 5750 rpm
torque (lb ft)	295 @ 2700 rpm
fuel system	LH-Jetronic
comp ratio	9.3:1
octane (RON)	91 unleaded
rev limit	(rpm)	6400

The spec book doesn't say, but the since the second character reflects the
market for which the engine is intended, I'll guess that "9" is for Oz.

	check

	first two digits thereof (see below)

	usually Z for non-US cars

	check

	check

	third digit of model type!

>	4		- Body type?

	"code for body and engine"; usually 4 for non-US cars

>	0239		- Serialization for the previous sequence of digits (i.e..,

	my impression is that this is serialization for all markets together

I'd guess the latter.

>Again, MUCHO MUCHO GRACIAS for your help!!!!

I can't help myself, particularly considering your name; wish me "Muchas
gracias" and I'll respond "De nada".

Enjoy your car!
