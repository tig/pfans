Hello, I bought a 928 back in april, and I've been reading this news group for a couple of months. I have some questions:
1. One of the fog lights is out, does anybody know where I can order some.
2. Does anybody know what type and size are the screws that hold the black plastic that goes over the fog-parking light assembly.
3. I want to buy a used left rear light plastic cover, sell me a cheap one!!
4. Does anyone know a good 928 mechanic in the Wichita (Kansas) area?
5. I've seen several 928 ranging from 78 model to GTS around the Wichita area, but I have not been able to talk to any of the owners. If you live around the wichita area let's get together our 928's one of this weekends.
6. What about organizing next summer a nationwide 928 meeting here in Wichita ( This city is in the middle of the US territory), that way the people from the east a west coast would have to travel the same distance.

I hope you can answer some of my questions, my 928 web site should be up a running a month from now, get ready.
