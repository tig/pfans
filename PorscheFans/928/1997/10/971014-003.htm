I finally found the Magic Blower Virus:

If you receive an e-mail with a subject of "Badtimes," delete it
immediately
WITHOUT reading it.  This is the most dangerous Email virus yet.  It
will
re-write your hard drive.  Not only that, but it will scramble any disks
that
are even close to your computer.  It will recalibrate your cruise
control and your AC coolness setting so all your ice cream in the glove
compartment goes
melty.  It will demagnetize the strips on all your credit cards, mess up
the
tracking on your VCR and use subspace field harmonics to scratch any
CD's you
try to play in your 928.  It will mix Water Wetter into your gas tank.
It will hide your car keys when you are late for work.

Such is the power of Badtimes, that it moves your 928 randomly around
parking lots so you can't find it. It is also a rather interesting shade
of burgundy.

Badtimes goes out to chase gradeschoolers with your 928.  These are just
a few signs... be very careful!
