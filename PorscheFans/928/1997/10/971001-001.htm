I had completely forgotten about the manual release and isn't there a
tool for this in the rear kit?  I need to RTFM (when I get the car back
:)

Both my seats are missing their respective rear bolts because:

1.  The driver's seat motor doesn't drive the seat forward enough to
uncover the rear holes.  The motor slows then just stops.   If I
'squoosh' down in the seat and push I can get it to move a hair more
forward than the motor assist which makes the car drivable for me.  It
must be binding somewhere and I'll try the manual release / adjustment
to get the rear bolts in.

2.  The passenger does go all the way (ha) but the holes don't line up
(g) so I'll have to enlarge them slightly to get my bolts in.  Wait just
a minute I'm laughing too hard...

Ok, sorry about that.  Luckily, I found a bunch of those allen head
bolts under one of the rear carpets so I don't have to scrounge around
for replacements.

Anyways, thanks for the post and the laughs!  Your message should go
into the FAQ but definately not my reply!
Phil
