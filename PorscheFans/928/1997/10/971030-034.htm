Well, he still doesn't have a license.  He can be thrilled, but still is a
pedestrian until grades in school reach a level enebling a "Good Student
discount" on insurance....

Take 580 East.  Exit Tassahara road (this is a mile or so east of the 580/680
intersection). Go North on Tassahara back over 580.  Turn left at sign
Highway Patrol.  The AutoX area is just behind the Highway Patrol building.
I don't know anything about AutoX since I've never been.  I plan to just
observe and maybe run if I can. In any case, I'll still cheer for you if you
show up. We'll see if I can get in.  I don't have a helmet, etc.

Who is Bert and why would you call him for run times? What are run times? See
how little I know?
