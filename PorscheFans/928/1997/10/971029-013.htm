I am 70 miles east of you and have the same experience.  Forget 1'st
when it's cold.  It heats up pretty quick after a few blocks.  I don't
drive it much in the winter, so it has not been as a big PIA as if I
drove it daily.  I have heard of other Porsche owners using synthetic
lube with some success, RedLine I think.  I've been told it's not a
cure-all, but that it does help allot.  

I never tried the synth in my tranny, perhaps next change.  I do run
synthetic oil in the engine and it helps allot on cold day's.  The
engine runs smooth and idles well down to 20F with Mobil 1 10W-30.  A
huge improvement over classic dino juice, highly recommended.  

Mobil now has a 0W-30, but that may be pushing it.  No need in the
tri-state area here anyway.  Perhaps if I lived way up north in Alaska,
Canada I'd need it.
