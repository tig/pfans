Like all generalizations, this one is just - wrong.  There are a lot of
Porsche owners who are not sociable, hostile etc.  Fortunately, most do
not belong to any of the clubs - PCA, POC.  I've had my 928 a lot longer
than the 911 and have been the recipient of a bunch of good natured
ribbing, joshing, teasing, whatever.  Empasis on the good-natured.  It
is a fact that many Porsche owners don't really know much about models
they have not owned.  I constantly find 911 owners surprised at standard
features in my rather old 928 which only found their way into the
air-cooled models recently.

My 928 is a wonderful car.  So is my 911, for its purpose.  I like them
both just as I enjoy both of my children.  The different Porsche cars,
like members of ones family have their differing attributes.  That
doesn't necessarily make one Porsche model better than another, nor it's
driver.  A little diversity is what keeps things interesting.

BTW, of the two Boxster owners I know fairly well and see frequently,
both owned 944s previously.  One still has a 356 as well.  I think the
only commonality you will find with Boxster owners is a previous good
Porsche experience.  Just as with repeat buyers of most makes.
