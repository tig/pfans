At tonight's PCA Potomac region's monthly meeting I will be meeting Chuck
Drake (PCA Zone 2 Rep) to get more information on maintaining an association
with PCA and simultaniously becoming a "928 Club" or "registry". Chuck and I
have already discussed this and he feels confident that an arrangement can
be made. I'm not holding my breath, but I consider Chuck a "straight
shooter" that's been with PCA for nearly 30 years and knowns his way around
the organization.

Since my posting on needing help to form the "928 Club", I have received
several offers. Phil Tong has already gotten started with this on the west
coast. I do not wish to re-invent the wheel, so we will coordinate our
efforts to avoid duplication and redundancy.

As far as funding for club activities, insurance, newsletters, electronic
bulletin boards, etc. That, and many other start-up problems will have to be
discussed at great length before any decision can be made. Hopefully, we
will be able to attract some advertizing and sponsorship income that would
help to offset the staggering costs I envision.

Let me give you preview of an event I have thought of doing for "928 Frenzy
Drei". A two day 928 only event for Concours, Rally, Social, and Autocross.
Social functions would include lunches and dinners, with perhaps alternative
things for significant others (that may not be  terribly interested in the
928 driving events) to do. PCA regions do these sort of events all the time.

Well, these are some of my thoughts. I've got to go to the meeting in a few
minutes. I'll give you a heads up if and when I find out anything
worthwhile.

Happy motoring. Ed
