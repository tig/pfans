Yes...for those choosing a non-Red Line product, be careful about using
TOO 
slippery a synthetic--make sure the mfger specs the lube for syncro
transmissions
AND meets GL-5 (not GL-4!).  If it's too slippery, the syncros won't be
able to 
engage sufficiently and you'll get gear clash, and possibly wear out the
syncros
early.  Note that in the latter case all will seem fine for quite some
time...you're
not going to know you're chosen the wrong lube for many thousands of
miles,
at which point you'd be pretty miffed, having to replace the syncros WAY
early.

Many, many stories of people running a regular synthetic gear oil and
damaging
transmissions in this way...wet motorcycle clutches suffer the same way
with 
non-motorcycle-specific synthetics.
