Victor:

On my '89 (and I must assume this is on your '90 also) look for a gas sample
tube from each exhaust manifold.  These run up into the rear of the engine
bay, and are capped with green silicone-plastic caps on my car.  The tubes
are there to facilitate tuning the mixture, allowing the gas sample to be
sniffed at the exhaust ahead of the catalyst.  As this is the same gas that
will exit your tailpipe with the cat removed,  try an analysis of this gas
before you swap in the pipe.

Local test station will do a "test" run for emissions for about $20.  This
is a pittance compared to R&R the cat twice.  Just get the tester to attach
the sample tube to his analyser for the run.

In defense of the cat, though-- the air here in the L.A. basin is cleaner
now than it has been in any modern time.  This is thanks to the catalysts
and such that we are so anxious to disable.  Think carefully about your
environmental responsibility before you make this change.  The life you
shorten may be yours... or mine.  Enough said.


Cheers!
