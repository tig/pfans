Fear not, fair maiden. The manual transmission on S4 cars is VERY strong
(good for more than double the stock power). The first few years of 928s
(starting in '78) had some gear chipping problems, which Porsche solved by
radically redesigning the transmission.

One consequence of the big, strong gears is that you should not expect to
make lightning gear changes. Move the lever deliberately and pause for a
beat in neutral on your way to the next gear, up or down. Also make sure
that the clutch pedal is FULLY depressed when changing gears.

Now, go back to the PorscheFans Web site (http://www.porschefans.com/) and
start browsing the archives for answers to many other questions. Also go to
Phil Tong's site (http://www.928s4vr.com/) for lots more info, pretty
pictures, and more, more, more!
