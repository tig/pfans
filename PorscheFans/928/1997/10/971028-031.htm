3 hours if you know what you're doing and you can CHANGE the belt.  

I can do the tensioning in under an hour, myself, and I'm NOT a
mechanic.

Basically, the steps to just TENSION the belt are:

 - jack up one rear wheel and spin the engine to TDC
 - remove air intake tubes from radiator
 - remove fan shroud
 - remove 2 cooling hoses on passenger side
 - remove passenger-side timing belt shroud
 - back off locknut on timing adjuster
 - slip the tool into the belt, and turn timing adjuster bolt to get the
right tension reading
 - check the tension another dozen times!
 - slap everything back on

To *change* the belt, additional steps are:

 - remove another cooling hose
 - remove oil sump return hose
 - loosen off power steering and A/C pumps
 - jack up front of the car, put it on jack stands
 - pull off clutch slave cylinder, and bribe a friend to slide under the
car and
   wedge a screwdriver against the ring gear
 - undo the crankshaft pulley bolt
 - put the clutch slave cylinder back in, and lower the car back down
 - unbolt the fan (3 bolts)
 - pull off the fan and the 4 belts
 - unbolt the other timing belt shrouds (2)
 - wiggle them out, swearing profusely
 - pull off the crankshaft pulleys and vibration damper
 - loosen the tensioner WAY off, and pull the old belt
 - line up camshaft sprockets EXACTLY
 - slap the new belt on, and reassemble

plan on

Special tool is $425 US.
