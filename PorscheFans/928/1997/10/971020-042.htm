Hi P-Phans,

I would like to ask y'all for specific information relating to the
newest member of my family.   A few hours ago, I just purchased a 1986
928S-Euro with 79K miles on the odo.  I bought it from a wholesaler here
in Houston that was wanting to move it (needed more floor plan money).
I'm sure swung a "really good" deal but I'll let the list assist me with
the final analysis.

The car is "Meteormetallic" (light metallic gray) with a black leather
(real leather smells great!) interior in perfect condition.  It's a 5
speed and appears to have the ZF locking transaxle (both rear tires are
wearing evenly and will need replacement).  It has a 32valve engine and
here's where my questions start.  I'm going to pull the option codes and
compare them to the listed codes on Phil's site.  But I would like to
hear from y'all regarding the performance characteristics of this car as
well but here's my first subjective observations...

THIS THING IS A BRUTE!!!!  It is DEFINITELY faster than my '79 5-speed
by far! and kinda scary to drive (at first).  It's also incredibly
tight.  No problems with the suspension; it drives straight, corner's
hard and brakes straight.  The PO's service records indicated that it
had a timing belt a four of months ago and was recently retensioned.  My
mechanic gave it a thumbs up overall.   It looks like an S4 on the
inside and sounds/feels/drives a world of difference than my older car.

Phil's site doesn't detail any differences between Euro versions of our
cars for the same model years.  This is where I'd like your help.
Please send me any information you have about this asphalt igniter.  

Many Thanks...  I'm going now for another drive... wwweeeeeeeeeee.

Bert
