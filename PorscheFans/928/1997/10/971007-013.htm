I should have known better than to post a crowing report about the
engine running like a sewing machine.........   :( .......it was short
lived.   I'm counting on you folks for the extra  brain power since my
calls to the Psychic Hotline meet only with busy signals -

79 Euro, stock, freshly rebuilt - had been running great until putting
load (like, DRIVING!)

Engine starts fine and can rev okay when cold.  As engine warms up, idle
begins to 'hunt' and power goes away - to the point that it will not rev
past about 2000 rpm.  This warmup period takes around five minutes after
which power is gone and it tends to stall.  Manually working throttle
instantly kills it (again, after engine is warm - not even hot at this
point).

I've checked flow of fuel pump (this car has only one pump - external
below fuel cell), and will verify pressure this evening.   I rigged the
setup shown in the factory manual to check the control pressure
regulator.  Results thus far:
                                                    system pressure =
3.8 bar (should be 5.2 min)
                                          control pressure 'cold'  = 2
bar    (   "       " ~2.0 )
                                           "    "       "   "   'warm"
= 2.5 bar (   "       "  2.8 min)
      vacuum pump must be continuously pumped to maintain vacuum on
regulator at the vacuum port

System passes leak-down test as in the manual.  Due to age and
maintenance of car, it is impossible to separate fittings at the
accumulator or filter without damage.   Once those items are
'disturbed', I'll be committed to several hundred dollars' worth of
parts (fuel line to accum, accum, filter, fittings, pump (?), etc.).
Obviously, if I gotta go there, I will.   But, it still seems to me the
anomoly should be on the regulator side of things because of the
temperature effect.

Dave Roberts and Mark at 928 Int'l have been very helpful, and thought
I'd post this to see what any of you have experienced.   Any and all
observations appreciated.   Thanks in advance!
