I read a post that listed the many more expensive troubles with aging 928's.
Fortunately for me (?), most of these have already happened, and are now
repaired.

One item caught my attention:  The loosening rivets on the torque converter.
Have any of you (us) had this trouble, and what were the symptoms.  It must
be a common problem, but neither P-car mecahnic I have spoken with had heard
of it.

My car has a vague vibration/moan at certain RPM's under certain conditions.
Could this be my trouble?  I was "diagnosed" as having either a bad bearing
at the front of the trans, or a bad "tube bearing."  Either would really
suck.

I'd appreciate any and all thoughts.

Also, I'm still looking for your old power steering cores for 928's and
944's, if you'll sell them to me cheap.
