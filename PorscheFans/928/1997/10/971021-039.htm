Good evening,

I have had some recent difficulty with fuel in both the 928 and the 
Mercedes 300te. I have been using Shell 92 octane in both of the vehicles 
after trying the other locally available brands. I.E. Texaco, Arco, 
Chevron.  Only the Shell or the Chevron fuels worked in either vehicle.  (I 
selected Shell as they all use ATM cards at the pump in Southern Cal.)

About three weeks ago, both vehicles were filled with Shell 92.  While 
driving the 928 on a short trip <50 miles,  I was entering the freeway and 
accelerated quite strongly, (this is one of the few times you can use 2nd 
and 3rd hard around here) and could hear what I consider quite strong 
detonation.  The computer kicked in very rapidly and the 928 lost most of 
its power due to ignition retard and going quite rich.  The rest of the way 
home I trying accelerating at this rate 3 or 4 mores times with the same 
results.  I was somewhat concerned that something might be wrong with the 
ignition and fuel control computers as I do have an Autothority chipset. 
 Possibly, its programming had gone goofy. (highly unlikely with an E-Prom)

Since I had to go south that same day for business, I took the 300te 
because of my concern for the 928.  Well,  as I entered the freeway ramp 
that I use to go to San Diego (which is a long uphill climb) GUESS WHAT? 
 The Mercedes starting pinging quite severely.    During the rest of my 
travels that day I was quite gentle on the throttle in order to not cause 
any softening of pistons etc.

I cured the problem by liberal doses of octane additives to both vehicles.

However, my question is, has anybody else in this group had a similar 
problem in SoCal in the last few months?  I sent an E-mail to Shell Oil and 
one of their research engineers called me about this problem. (Amazingly) 
He asked if I could query other owners to see if this problem is occurring 
to others.  It appears that the CARB Stage 2 rules have made them change 
their RON and MON numbers by reducing aromatics , the fuel still rates a 92 
rating but reduces what he called tolerance to detonation or pinging. 
 Shell has 93 octane everywhere but SoCal and if there were enough 
complaints about this problem they would consider selling or upgrading to 
this in SoCal.  They currently do not sell because of cost and competitive 
reasons.

At 1.68 a gallon already, if it costs another 5 to 10  cents per, who 
cares, as long as it works.

Sorry for the long post folks.
