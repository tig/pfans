Well - i am having a problem.

I had a short-piped toyota supra before my 928, and i had a guy that =
helped me pass it. Because of the new laws etc, and the new equipment, =
he doesnt do business anymore. So now I'm stuck with this 928, with all =
of its legal components, and it JUST WONT PASS!
They made the requirements higher. Ive spent $400 for my mechanics (very =
good porsche mechanics) to tinker and make more efficient, but it just =
will not pass. I dont want to talk to a referee before I exhaust all my =
avenues, because I love my car and I dont want to be screwed the next =
time California changes some smog law and I happen to be on some list =
the Refs have. (Like my truck, with all of its legal equipment, got on =
the gross polluters list because of a misfire that was easily fixed, and =
now its a HA$$LE every time I fart or register)

In short - the US government and the CA government have well meaning =
plans (including these broad regulations on smog etc) But sometimes they =
are just plain WRONG.

1. US cities that mandatorily flouridate their water have 10% higher =
cancer rates. (I do network consulting with a cancer-research-treatment =
biomedical firm)
2. US government supports OIL LOBBYISTS who buy and 'shelve' thousands =
of combustion engine efficiency aids every year. (Go take a look at the =
hybrid engine in the smithsonian that uses clean burning kerosine that =
never went into production)
3. US government is dragging their heels on ethanol production and =
implementation (clean burning, renewable since it comes from crops and =
not oil) even though they have test facilities and successful city-wide =
tests under their belt.
4. Smoking is STILL LEGAL. Smoking an addictive agent like nicotine is =
perfectly legal but running a more efficient exhaust system is BAD.


So I think that if qwkvic wants to get rid of his catalytic converter =
and smoke some fools before we all have to drive expensive short-ranged =
electric cars, more power to him! Im getting all the use out of my car =
while its still legal to own one. :)
