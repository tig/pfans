I am in a position to buy the following car for $15,000 and would like
to hear opinions regarding the advisablility of proceeding with the
purchase.

1985 928S equipped with the usual (automatic, leather, S/R, etc.). 
Completely stock excepting an Alpine stereo unit with C/D changer. 
Mileage is an authenticated 29,000.  Silver with black interior. 
Interior is Condition 2+ (arguably 1).  Exterior is Condition 2 except
for a few cosmetic problems at the front, i.e.:

-A 2" diameter dimple at one corner of the front bumper cover.  The
bumper cap and front hood edge are slighty out of alignment (1/8 inch
declining to 1/16 inch). There are two 1" diameter spots on fender above
headlamp where the paint seems to have been retouched badly by hand.
Appears front corner tapped by/into something although touched-up areas
may have resulted from stone chips.  Seller says he bought the car with
these defects.  Alignment between doors and fenders is fine.

-Seller admits to knocking off the chin spoiler on a curb. He installed
an OEM replacement himself that fits imperfectly; there is some minor
cracking of the paint on the spoiler above. 

Engine compartment and underside Condition 3+, maybe 2.  Although I
intend to drive the car (weekends only), I would say $3,000 to $4,000
could make the car Condition 1 (concours).

I drove the car for an hour.  Tracks well, powers well and braked
straight most of the time.  On one occasion, under moderate braking from
60 mph, there seemed to be a slight pull to the left.

Seller is the second owner having purchased the car in 1994 (mileage
16,000 then) from the local BMW dealer, who had taken it in trade. 
Seller has all receipts & records since '94, but nothing prior.

Autohaus in Morristown, NJ will conduct the pre-purchase inspection and
do the 30,000 mile service ($600) and replace the timing belt ($600)
(all at my expense).  The seller is delivering the car to Autohaus and
will leave it there if it passes the purchase inspection. I will take
delivery after servicing. 

I note in the December '97 issue of OCPG that '85 928's are valued from
$17,400 (Cond. 3) to $44,000 (Cond. 1), which is up quite a lot from
August.  By this not infallible measure, $15,000 for the car described
above seems quite a good buy.  

Any and all comments appreciated.

Yours,

Jim Foley
