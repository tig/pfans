I've been lurking on the lists for a while and I think they are great!!  =
 =

:-)

I wonder if anyone can help. =


I have a Euro.spec 32 valve 928S4 Auto, 1987 model which is having =

problems.:-(

Accelerating hard from a junction the engine lost power suddenly, =

luckily, by pumping the throttle, I barely managed to coax the car the =

last few hundred metres home.

Now the car will start okay but dies after a couple of seconds, =

occasionally I can get it to run to high rpm by pumping the =

accelerator, it coughs, spits and then dies. :-o

I've checked fuel pump, throttle potentiometer, air mass sensor as best =

I can (don't have oscilloscope), engine temp. sensor II, injectors and =

there are no leaks in the intake system. I am in the process of =

checking the vacuum hoses and then will start back at the beginning and =

check everything again! =


Only then will I take it to the boys with the diagnostic machines, =

which I don't have. I was wondering if anyone on the lists has any =

suggestions. I have the EZK control unit and I'm hoping its not one of =

these expensive bits that has gone wrong.

Here's hoping someone tells me its the big nut that holds the steering =

wheel is broke;-} hey that's me and I am!

Appreciate any and all help, comments, anything!


Jeremy.
