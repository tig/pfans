" Phil T.---you are one of our greatest driving forces. Thanks for all
your
hard work. "

Thanks for the compliment - now if I could only do something about my
actual driving!



"  From our conversations at the "Frenzy" I understood most people
opting for
forming under the PCA, because they would be our best link to Porsche AG
and
Porsche Cars North America. In fact, it was mentioned, that unless we
could... "

Oh yes, agreed (and made sure I said so on the webpage in case they're
following us). I was playing what if and didn't see a clear answer just
then.  These are special cars, owned by special people, many that are
members of that special club, so maybe they'll do something special for
us!  We have the will, just need an infrastructure...



"  be under the PCA somehow, that we would be best served by just
continuing to
participate and promote the good things we've already got going here. "

This is ok too - but I am reminded of my history teacher droning on
about lassez faire or something...  It's true we don't need an official
club to have get togethers, beer nights, webpages, etc. but we do need
to keep an eye on the series or it really will be a German Avanti,
slipping quietly into obscurity.  

pkal suggested we keep it light in the beginning so maybe we are trying
to build Rome in a day.  As long as we don't drop the ball, ok?

All excellent points Greg.  Especially the part about becoming more
active with the local regions.  Heck, Kim's been at the front lines for
years now - it is time we join him isn't it?

928's Forever
Phil
