I'd like to hear from anyone that has experience in shipping a car
across
the country as I might be doing that soon.  Specifically, Virginia to
Seattle.  Names and telephone numbers of trucking firms that specialize
in this kind of thing would be appreciated.

Hi Tom:

I kind of have a tale of woe on x-country but hopefully it won't be your
experience:

My GT was trucked from Columbus, OH to SF, CA by D&D Trucking.

At load time (I wasn't there) special instructions and wooden blocks
provided to load the 928.  Unfortunately for me, when I went to pick up
the car in SF, it was already unloaded with the front spoiler completely
torn off and sitting in the hatch, soiling the rear seatbacks and rear
carpet.  As you may or may not know, on the GT, the front spoiler's rear
mounting points attach to the oil cooler.  So yes, in tearing off my
front spoiler, all those rear mounting tabs were destroyed as well.
Thankfully the cooler has no leaks.  Additionally, the spoiler mounts to
various points on the inner fender wells, so those mounting holes were
cracked and torn too.

To continue this travesty, some of the paint on the nose of the car had
been rubbed raw - an obvious sign that either the GT or the car in front
of it had not been secured properly and the two cars rubbed during
transit.

I gave the company written notice within their allotted time frame and
followed up with supporting documents via registered mail but to date I
have received no response from them.  I wonder if they'll respond now
that they've lost 800+ potential customers.  D&D Trucking  gave Lucky
every guarantee that the car would be fully insured against damage but
they are turning out to be just flakes.

Any of you attorneys want to lend your assistance?
Phil Tong
