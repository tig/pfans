Provided you have a real "S" with engine code M2811 or M2812 and not a
regular euro 928 with "S" spoiler and engine code M2809 or M2810, the
difference could be explained by torque.  To most people, the feeling of
power comes more from low to mid-range torque than maximum HP which is
usually measured nearer the peak of the effective rpm range.  In your
example, although the 1985 with 288 @ 5750 rpm had less HP than your
1981 Euro with around 300 @ 5900rpm, the 85 had 302ftlbs(SAE) of torque
@ 2700 rpm vs. the euro's 263 @ 4500 rpm.  Gearing also makes a
difference, although the 81 Euro car had a little closer ratio probably
to take advantage of the fact that torque comes on at the upper rpm
ranges.
