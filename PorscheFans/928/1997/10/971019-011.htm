I have just bought an '86 928S, after looking for several months. The
car appears to be in very good condition, but I need some help with a
few small parts and some info.

I have just received the factory shop manuals (thanks to the notice on
this group about Bill Taub's sale), and am slightly disappointed. There
is a -lot- of info that is not in the books. No mention of motor mounts,
for example. My immediate problem is the "belt tension" warning. The
light comes on shortly after cranking the car, despite the fact that the
belt is new and tight. The books barely mention the sensor. How does it
work? The maintenance records show a bad belt tension sensor in about
'88, and I think that the problem may be recurring. Any tips?

I also need a few small parts, such as the small rear floorboard
carpets, in what I would call champagne, a seat back release lever, etc.
I am located in the Atlanta metro area.
