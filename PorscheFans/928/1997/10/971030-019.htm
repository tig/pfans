>>Since most engine wear occurs at start up, it does makes sense to go
lighter in winter in order to get the oil pumped through the engine as
quickly as possible.  

Any synthetic is going to be reasonably insensitive to temperature,
unless you're in extreme temps.  For instance, the pour point of Red
Line and Mobil 1 synthetics is around -50F (petroleum 20W50s are in the
-10 range)!

The other big factor with synthetics (not all, but certainly Red Line,
Amsoil, and I think Mobil 1) is that they tend NOT to run off parts, so
you tend not to start a "dry" engine, which means you don't need to
worry much about how long it takes to get the oil pumped around at
start-up. Of course, if you've let the engine sit for 6 months....

>>My 928 is not driven much over the winter, so I'm not terribly worried
about it.  If I put more than 800 miles on the 10W30 over the winter
before changing it in the spring I've driven it allot.  I only use it
when the daily driver is laid up for service or it's an exceptionally
nice day with clear roads and I'm not at work (very rare).  

With that mileage on the 10W30, maybe it's a non-issue!
