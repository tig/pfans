For what it's worth, New York's current governor decreed, shortly after his
election, that the NY State Police were no longer to use any unmarked cars,
reversing the previous policy of putting any confiscated vehicle (e.g.,
BMWs, Toyotas, you name it) to work as a police car. His primary concern
was bad guys masquerading as cops. Municipalities can still use what they
want (my town has an old black Thunderbird and an old black Ford sedan
which even the locals miss now and then).

A good advertisement for keeping the car in a low gear with the revs up;
you get strong acceleration when you come on the throttle, and strong
lights-free engine braking when you come off.

It wouldn't surprise me. Where are you moving?
