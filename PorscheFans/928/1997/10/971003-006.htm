 Regret i had to cancel the Frenzy..but comments on ride height.. I bought my
'86 in 1989. Shorly thereafter I had the misfortune to drive over a somewhat
raised manhole cover which had no warning cones.  The point of impact was the
air conditioner.  As some know, oem compressers are $1000+/-.  Since only the
mounting ear was damaged, thes was heli-arced and reconstructed.  The
remaining cash from my collision claim was used to replace the tin shield
with a 3/16'" T6061 alum. rallye shield which also covers the leading edge of
the oil pan.  It has worked very wel, some hits, but no catastrophes.

The real point of the strory, I had the ride height also checked and it was
way out--enough too low in front to have been the difference between missing
and hitting the cover..
