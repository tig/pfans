This weekend I had an unexpeded house guest.  An old Army buddy of mine
called last minute to let me know he would be in town over the weekend.
I had already planned to spend Saturday replacing struts and brake pads
on all four corners.... I have a difficult time getting full days away
from work.....He said it was cool.  We spent the day working on the car
and got it done in time to get it aligned, washed and so on.  This
afternoon were cruising along a local unpatrolled turnpike when a 97
vette came along side, he would speed up and realize I didn't take the
bait, then slow alongside and do it again....so I nailed it......  He
kept within a car length behind us until 100 then I pulled away quite
noticeably.  I looked in my rear view at  about 145....HE was waaayyy
back.....I slowed down to about 120, and when he cought up, I nailed it
again and we left him behind again.......after slowing alongside him at
130, I looked over and his face showed his frustration.  I guess he had
it all the way to the floor.....  My out of town passenger wanted me to
check with you guys to see if any of you would trade an S4 for 95 M3?
