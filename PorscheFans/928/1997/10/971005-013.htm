Answer to "Ostrich Meat Company" 

ABS Fault: dealer or specialist has plug-in diagnostics module to read error
codes.  Unless an obvious broken wheel sensor or fuse problem isn't found,
the diagnostic check is the way to go, can save money due to "cherry
picking" guesses.

AT Performance: As you can see, the factory manuals are the way to go.  Here
is some data from the North America factory manuals to provide answers
regarding the 928 AT.   There are two AT "gearing schemes" used, the earlier
'83-88 has a numerically smaller (higher ratio) 1st gear and final drive,
and the '89s and beyond have the numerically higher (lower ratio) 1st gear
and final drive.  Combining normal 2nd gear stars, the higher ratios with
the lower HP and higher torque converter stall speeds of the earlier models
yields the slower feeling "off the line" acceleration followed by a burst of
power as the engine gets into it's higher HP/Torque bands.  (Some manual
ratios provided for comparison)

a. Model Types

928 S USA/Japan model '83-84 transmission type: AT = A28.01

928 S USA/Japan model '85: AT = A28.04, manual = G 28/11

928 S USA/Japan model '86: AT = A28.07, manual = G 28/11

928 S4 USA/Japan model '87-88: AT = A28.12, manual = G 28/13

928 S4 worldwide '89-91: AT = A28.16, manual = G28/55

928 GTS worldwide 92-93: AT = A28.18, manual = G28/75 (couldn't find ratios)

b. Ratios

Ratios: A28/.01/.04/.07/.12     A28.16/.18      G 28/11/13      G 28/57         
1st:    3.68                    3.87            4.0672          3.7745
2nd:    2.41                    2.25            2.7142          2.5188
3rd:    1.44                    1.44            1.9339          1.7948
4th:    1.00                    1.00            1.4629          1.3577
5th:    n/a                     n/a             1.000           1.000
Rev.:   5.14                    5.59

Final 
Drive:  2.20                    2.538           2.20            2.7272

For you Euro model owners, the ROW and Europe models had options for 2.357
and special Euro option is listed for the lower 2.538 ratio final drive
ratios.  Do you have'm?

c. AT Torque Converter Stall Speeds:

A28.01: 2200 to 2600 RPM

A28.04/.07: 1650 to 2050 RPM

A28.12/.16./.18: 1750 to 2150 RPM

If there is a AT guru that could comment on the effect of AT stall speed and
gearing, that would be an interesting discussion topic.
