Not sure if you've received responses on your questions, but I'll chime in.

> What would it take to make it a 300hp, stiffer handling
> EURO/S model?  

Engine:
A different engine block with a different set of heads and a different set
of cams along with a different intake/fuel injection system. This change
really means total rebuild. But why bother?

Suspension:
Different springs on the front end. 

Total cost of above:
Approximately $6000 on a _screamin'_ deal.

> Back to the subject, does it take that much to change over? 

"that much" is very subjective terminology. In the end, you'd be better off
finding and buying a Euro. Period.

> Did the body change in any significant way that would

The body did not change from 78 thru 86. Euro releases came out during
those years.

Money, time, expertise and simple logic.

Dual exhaust is the better option for anything (headers or not).
