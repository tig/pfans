I have an '86 and the Monterey push buttons "went south" ..repairs were est.
at $150, so I replaced the unit with a CD.

The installer advised the Porsche amplifiedr and fader were unique and not
very good.  The amp was replaced and installed is original place.  The CD was
a SONY with a walkman jack so I could play tapes.  All Porsche speaker wiring
was by passed, but original speakers were used.  Unit has worked well for 5
years.  Total cost about $350.  Amp is not overpowereing as I hat R & R, and
play classical or big band.
