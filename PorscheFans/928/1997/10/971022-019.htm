I changed my resistor pack a few months ago, basically because only two of =
my fan speeds were working.  Upon removal of the pack, I found that two of =
the four resistors were actually burned in half.  I also installed a brand =
new blower motor, as the bearings were worn.  The car did have magic blower=
 syndrome real bad before I did this.

After I did the work, the magic blower syndrome was gone for a while.  It s=
lowly came back, a little at a time.  It's still not as bad as it was befor=
e, but WHY DOES IT DO THAT?

Anyway, I guess that just changing the resistor pack may not be the answer,=
 and changing the resistor pack and the motor doesn't seem to be the answer=
 either.(????)

I don't know what to tell you.

P.S.  If you're running the fan and you get smoke pouring out of your vents=
 and an electrical burning smell, it's probably one of the resistors burnin=
g out.  Happened to me.  Didn't hurt anything, smoke only lasted a minute o=
r less.  Scary, but don't panic.  If smoke doesn't stop pretty quickly, you=
 may have a real fire!  React accordingly. (We all carry fire extinguishers=
 in ALL of our cars, right?)
