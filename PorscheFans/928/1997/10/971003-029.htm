This is from section 44 of the manual. Front height from level ground with a
car that has not been raised should be between 170mm to 190mm. The
difference from side to side should not be more than 10mm. Measure to the
tab at the bottom of the rear control arm support. This only applies to cars
with adjustable perches.

For the rears the height shoul be between 173mm and 183mm.

To adjust the height DO NOT raise the car. Turn the wheel as far over as
possible to gain access to the large adjustment nut. With the spanner wrench
(or with an adjustable clamp mentioned at the Frenzy) turn the nut
counter-clockwise to go up and clockwise to lower. Depending on your spring
rate you will change the height by about 2-3mms per full turn. If your
height is way off, I recommend that you change the height by several turns.
Stop after an equal number of turns have been applied to both sides. Drive
the car a few miles/minutes, and  re-check the height. Repeat the process
until the car is within specs. Now get it aligned by a shop that does
Porsches. DO NOT go to any discount alignment shops!

Happy motoring. Ed
