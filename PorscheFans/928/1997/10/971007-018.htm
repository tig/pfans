Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

The question on "chips" came up recently and I would like to add my .928
cents.

There are a few manufacturers of performance chips for 928's. Some promise
very high output for relatively little cost. "AutoThority" chips are the
most expensive I've seen, yet they are listed as having the least
performance of any of the chips I have read about. Guess what brand I have
in my 86 928S? If you said Autothority, you probably know why. I picked
AutoThority  because they have a proven record and deliver at the very least
that which they claim if not a bit more. Also, and most important, they do
not damage the engine in the long run. Other chips  may or may not. Do you
want to take the risk of damaging your multi-thousand dollar engine only to
save a few hundred bucks?!

I've had the chips for about 8 months and can say that I do have more power
and torque whenever I need them. Unfortunately, I do not have a limited slip
differential, so the power/torque must be moderated while exiting tight
turns or else I can spin the inside rear all too easily. If you were at the
last PCA Potomac Region autocross, you know what I mean.

Happy motoring. Ed
