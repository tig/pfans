Yeah, three hours sounds a bit high, but take a look at all the stuff they
have to take off to get at it.

I had a problem with mine where the belt light kept coming on and it was
a faulty damper in the sensor or some such thing.  It was back three or
four times before they sorted it out.

Hello friends :

My 87 928 s4 (stick) has recently arrived to South Florida from Montreal,
Canada.  I can recommend an excellent transport carrier for this route. 
Here`s a tip if you are looking for a decent auto transport company, call a
local exotic car dealership and ask them who they use.  Now for my question
: I am at 107,000 km and my belt tension light comes on under hard
acceleration, so I figure that it must be time to retension the timing belt
(Yes it was changed at around 85/90 000 km).  I inquired at the local
dealership and they said that it would take 3 hours (@$69 per hour, Gasp!).
 Does it really take that long ? Is it very very difficult to do ? I am
almost tempted to invest in the special tool required since I plan on
keeping this beautiful car for a very very long time.

Thanks

Serge
