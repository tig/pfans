Leonard, Jim, Susan, Mark (hope I didn't leave anyone out),

Many Many Thanks for your speedy replies to my request for information.
After cleaning some gook off the option sticker in the trunk, I came up
with this information:

Eng/Trans number:	M2821-82G      G2810-11G

The only option code listed looks like C00 (Eurospec Emissions).
However, it was very hard to read due to the carpet backing glue that
has stuck to the metal in the trunk area.  After cleaning it off, the
code looked like C0D but there's no reference to a C0D option code on
Phil's site.  The code could also be G0D, 00D or 000.  It's rather faded
and hard to read (even in the sunlight).  

Where are the engine code numbers stamped on a 32V block?  Is it
possible that this is a 16V Euro motor but with the early 32V plenum and
heads? (not likely).  This plenum is not the eight pipe "spider" unit
with the crest we're used to seeing on the earlier cars.  It's the early
32V intake with two long blocks on either end and several air pipes
crossing and going into the block; "32V" is clearly molded into the
intake.

The plot now thickens!  Does this car have a US motor?  Is this a
"special" early 32V motor we're yet to hear about (wishful thinking).
Is the transmission a LSD unit or ZF locking unit?  

Regardless of the outcome, this car is now very special to me and a
definite keeper.  I'm beginning to feel like when a new baby was born
into our family.  The period of discovery is just beginning!

Happy Motoring!

Bert
