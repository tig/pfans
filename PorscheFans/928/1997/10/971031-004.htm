Josh, here's a copy of a posting I made on Oct 1 this year about this - it
does work for Wisconsin winters - that's where I live too!

Storing for the winter season is a relatively straight-forward.  I've stored
various model 928s for about 10 years with no troubles.  Our local PCA
magazine has a very good annual article about storing.  When I see it I'll
check about posting it or perhaps getting it added to the FAQ.  In the
meantime, here's the basics that I observe:

1) Add a fuel stabilizer - I believe the brand name "Sta-bil" is the
standard.  I've heard different recommendations on how full to keep the tank
but try to keep at least a half-tank full of gas.  Add appropriate amount of
stabilizer.
2) Remove battery.  Keep in warm place and charge periodically
3) Plug engine/exhaust openings with steel wool - you don't want mice
creating a nest in your air filter box (like I had last winter) - obviously
I didn't follow this advice last year :-(
4) Good exterior washing - make sure good and dry before storing.  If
storing indoors then use a flannel car cover (it breathes).  I'm not sure
what to recommend for outdoor storing.
5) Relax doors, hatch, and wipers.  This is to avoid compression of the
seals. Shut doors to first stop position.  Put a wood block under your
wipers to keep off the glass.

That's basically what I do before storing.  In the spring I get the oil and
coolant changed as soon as I can.  I also change brake fluid every other
year.

Starting it the first time in the spring used to be a problem for me before
I bought a good battery charger with a 50 amp starter in it.  I charge the
battery good before replacing it in the car and then I start the car with
the charger hooked up.  I flip the switch on the charger for the "start"
mode and start the car.  It starts right up - and what a wonderful feeling
that is too :-)
