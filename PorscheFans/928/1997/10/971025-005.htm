I have an 81 928 in need of a few repairs. 

1st, the linkage or something on the drivers side door lock arent
working properly. Was working fine, the one day the lock turned
extreamly easy. Thats all it did was turn. I t diddent unlock the eather
door. I have to turn the passenger side lock and the electronics will
unlock both sides. There must be seperate linkage for the key and
electronics. 

I hate removing door pannels. Is this a hard repair that requires
special tools?

2nd, After taking the car through a car wash, the central warning system
light came on for the brake system. This happend to me before. A sensor
for the brake system had blowen right after a car wash. I diddent think
the car wash was to blame. Now after the same car wash (2 years latter),
the same warning light. I havent taken it to the shop yet so I dont know
what exactly is wrong. My breaks are new, 2000 miles and the fluid level
is good. Any input?
