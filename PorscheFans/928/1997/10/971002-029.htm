at my brake calipers and did not see "Porsche" in raised letters on the
calipers.  I was under the impression this existed on all models from 1972
on.  Does anyone know if this is true?  I might have after market calipers.

I don't think so. I drove 928 #166 (a 78 Automatic, that had been brought
over from Germany - see on Phil's website in the 928 section), and on the
pictures I took at the time I cannot see the PORSCHE lettering either.

I also checked the pictures in the Performance Portfilio, and can't see it on
the pictures of the early 928s. So I assume that the early 928s just did not
have it.
