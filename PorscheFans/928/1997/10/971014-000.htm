This really depends on your definition of 'nice' and how realistic
you'll be when looking at cars in this price range (and age).  I
partially agree with Ed that most cars in this range are going to be a
little rough.  I wholeheartedly agree that you need to educate yourself
before you start targeting cars so you'll know what to look for.  IMO it
will be an original issue 928, possibly up to an early 928 S model, a
big score would be '85 - '86 928 S (known to happen but it would
definately need work at the < $6k range).

Here on the west coast, prices might be slightly lower due to the
increased supply side and lack of demand side.  I just saw an '81 with
new paint, etc. for $4,800. Is this what you're thinking of?  For that
price I'd accept some foibles, like cracked dash & warped panels, worn
interior, etc. as it's only natural wear and tear, you know?  Of course
you'd negotiate price.  All part of the being realistic approach.  You
will be on your own but some prefer this type of hunt!

I think it's a foregone conclusion that at this price range (and age of
car anyways) that all the cars will have in excess of  150k miles.  This
is not a big deal at all for a 928 UNLESS the previous ownership
neglected / abused the car, or, you're going into the purchase thinking
you won't have to spend anything on preventive maintenance or repairs.
Some things you'll have to correct.  Others you can pass on for a time.
For example say the power mirrors don't work.  Big deal.  Later you find
the mirror motors are burnt so a switch swap won't do.   It would be
nice if they did but you can manually set the mirrors or stick on
aftermarket mirror lenses and move on.  Bring your compression tester
with you.  A weak motor is not to be accepted as you'll have your hands
full with other things.   I'd avoid auction or pawn lots.

If it's an early 928 you want (and can afford) then go for it.  You're
going to have to show restraint like crazy to hold out for the 'right'
one but it will be there - take it from me, who found a lovely 928 with
141k miles, owned by an aging doctor, that actually ran stronger than
stock on the dyno (199 rear wheel hp x 1.2 = 238.8hp) & kicked the
factory 1/4 miles in the @## (15.0 vs. 15.5).  If I didn't have to I
wouldn't have sold it as I love that car foibles and all.  Days off the
road due to mechanical breakdown = zero.  But I went through literally
dozens of cars before buying that one.

So I give the thumbs up on continuing your 928 hunt but do so cautiously
as the 'good' cars are getting harder to find.

Phil
ps.  I know LL, you're wondering what am I doing looking at another
928!?!  Like a moth to a flame I guess.  928's Forever... and 928's
Everywhere!
