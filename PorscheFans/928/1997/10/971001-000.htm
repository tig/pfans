Fans am I ever going to count my blessings tonight.

Whilst pulling into the neighbor bank parking lot did my clutch pedal go
to the floor and NOT return!  What in the h___?   My foot searched
frantically for the pedal and it was like an alien spaceship abducted
it.  Nowhere to be found.  Luckily there was an open parking space and I
idled in 1st and parked.

Reached down and pulled the pedal up.  The pedal sprung back to normal
position.  But when depressed, it stuck to the floorboard once again.
Suspecting the worst, I opened the hood to find the resevoir completely
dry!  Then did I notice fluid dripping onto the ground near the drivers
side - a hose had cracked barfing fluid out of not only the clutch but
the entire brake system too!

A quick tow to Auto Sport Haus in SF and the car should be ready by
tomorrow afternoon.

Just a note about how quickly one can get into a 'situation' without
even trying.  I shudder to think of this happening on the highway at any
speed, or even at the fence enclosed autocross at 3Com.  At the least
I'll have all fresh fluid again.

Whew!  Lucky so to speak.
Or maybe it was Dad watching over me?  I'd like to think so...
Phil
