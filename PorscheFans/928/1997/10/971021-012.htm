That's good, just as it's supposed to be. The nice thing is that you'll get
over the feeling of "too much car" without being in danger from bad
behavior, because this car doesn't behave badly. Push it and it will thrill
you without putting you at risk.

There's lot's more in the factory spec book (a vital purchase for less than
$10; try http://www.my-porsche.com/link2.htm#tech). There's also a big
issue concerning your front brakes, which will be the bigger, "S4" variety
if your car was manufactured after a certain date (which I don't recall
just now, but expect to see reposted by someone reading this).

>Many Thanks...

You're welcome.

>I'm going now for another drive... wwweeeeeeeeeee.

Yes, sir! Then go do it again!
