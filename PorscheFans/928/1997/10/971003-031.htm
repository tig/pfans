928 fans,

I just caught up w/ my digest and read the note by Eddie Plantillas and like
others of you either need therapy or sex...or maybe both.

I was in attendance at the Texas World Speedway PCA drivers ed event this
weekend here in central Texas and had a blast.  There were a total of 5 928's
driving at this event and it was just awesome to dice w/ them and see them
dice with others.

We had 3 '88 S4's an '86S, and an '82 (I think that was the year anyway).  We
were spread across 3 different run groups but ended the weekend with 3 of us
in the Yellow run group (very middle of the 5 groups at these events).
 Elliott (a subscriber and contributor to this list) and I both got some in
car video of one of each of our runs...totally awesome.  I watched it last
night and immediately wanted to get back out on the track.

These cars are so capable and so forgiving it is unreal...some of the stupid
things I did would have taken any 911 at the track off course for sure but
the 928 just soaked it up and kept going.  I was on brand new D40's and they
were begging for mercy from the first turn of the wheel...I am now over
driving my tires so bad that I will have to do either different tires or a
whole new set of wheels and tires to get much faster...I am still braking to
early, but my corner speeds are about at the limit.

I had a few very interesting experiences:

As I let off of the gas and started my turn off of the high banked front
straight onto the road course at 135 (only once was I able to attain that
speed) I got on the brake and the back end stepped out on me what felt like a
few feet, but was probably not more than a few inches and as soon as I
released the brake it straightened out and I was able to blast through the
corner.

Exiting turn 8 I romped on it and had a nice little four wheel drift going
and was sure I was going to do a little agricultural engineering when all of
a sudden it hooked up (I had nothing to do with this save) and I was able to
make the corner, but I was so excited that I was about a mile (ok it was
probably more like 8 ft or so) off of the turn 9 apex and going a bit to fast
and ran my right hand tires off the track before turn 10.  The car slid the
back out a bit and I released the wheel for a fraction of a second and it
jumped back on the track and snapped the other way another split second
release and back to the right, and one more time and we were headed straight
down the track with just the right amount (maybe even a tad to little) speed
to get through 10, 11, and 12 (a really nice connected set of corners) and
back to the front straight at which point I pitted for a moment to gain my
composure and back out I went.

It was an awesome weekend and until you get a 928 out on the track you just
can't believe how high this cars abilities really are...they are amazing!!

I LOVE THIS CAR!!!!  Hope you can all make a track event at least some time
some place...you will love it.
