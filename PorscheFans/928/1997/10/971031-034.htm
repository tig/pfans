Hello Shark types and FWIW:
Regarding the comment below:
>>>UNFORTUNATELY, the troopers here have a new trick.  With instant on
radar,
>>>they are not driving around with the beam out.  They sit and wait
until you
>>>are right on them, and at a range of about 150 feet, they hit you.

This is an OLD trick here in Utah, as there are many times when there
are few cars on the road.  What I do, (Hypothetically, of course <grin>)
is to position my "slow-down" foot over its respective pedal and drive.
If  I do get "shot" by instant-on, I pounce on the brakes hard, if you
keep your detector on "Loud" it speeds your reaction.  Understand, this
technique is only for "2am, no headlights for miles, familiar road, just
get me home" situations.  Braking suddenly in traffic would be silly!
Okokokok... The theory here is fairly sound:  According to my cop
friend, the "brains" in a radar unit need several speed samples to
verify your speed with some accuracy, and if your speed changes
drastically, it assumes it had a bad data point and gets another one.
Our cars slow so fast that you can significantly change the speed the
radar "locks" you at with this method. _ Do_ expect to get stopped, and
have to do some fast talking.  My favorite is "The engine was stumbling
a bit back there and since there was _No one_ on the road, I decided to
blow the carbon out.  I was just slowing back down when I saw you,,,
Honest!"
(I also use a Trapshooter remote, control unit mounted under the pod and
with the power off it vanishes!)
