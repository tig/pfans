Sounds as if the link from the lock to the mechanism may have come
loose. Sorry, you're really going to have to take off the door panel,
but it isn't that big a deal. Some things I remember:
- the inside lock knob is held by a screw under the pop-off center.
Then the surround is removed by unscrewing it.
- the piece above the armrest is held in place by the surround for
the inside latch handle, and a couple of the usual door panel gizmos.
Pull it out and then up.
- the armrest is held by several screws, including some down in the
door pocket and one at the front where air is fed into the armrest.
Be careful of the electrical connections in there when you remove it.
- another visible screw or two for the door panel itself.
- then go around the door, carefully popping all the panel gizmos.
- panel removed by lifting up and back.
