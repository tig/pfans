<<Given today's current 928 values, does anybody think a nice 928 can be had

in the $4,000 to $6,000 range? Also, what is the general thinking on

extremely high mileage cars? Comments anyone?>>

Kelly,
I'm not too sure that I would consider any 928 that sold for $6,000 "nice",
but one can be had in that proce range that is mechanically reliable and
cosmetically acceptable.  It would , most certainly be a late 70's or early
80's model.  I myself have no worries or reservations at all about buying a
high mile 928, IF the car has been maintained properly.  928's have been well
known to reach 2 and 300,00 miles before needing any kind of engine rebuild.
 Are you looking to purchase a 928 or just pondering Porsche?  Good question
regardless, I haven't seenthat one on the list before.
