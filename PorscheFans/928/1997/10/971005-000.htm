Just bought an 87 928 S4. It is red on red, auto (unfortunately) and has a
few miles on it 122K, however it is in good condition. I am very pleased
with this car both performance wise and handling. I get a lot of looks
driving it.  I have a few questions for you buffs though. 

1) After driving the car for about one minute my warning light comes on and
then my ABS light illuminates.  Brakes seem to work fine however I believe
that the ABS will be bypassed if something is wrong with it.  Is there a
common malfunction with these things or simple tests that I can perform to
find out the problem?

2) I need to replace the evaporator under the dash.  I presume it is on the
passenger side and will be a FUN job.  I guess I will need a manual. I have
not found an aftermarket manual for this car yet.  I believe Haynes or
Chilton prints one up to 81. Does any one know who prints one except for
the $280+ original manuals.   

3) I have noticed that this cars has better high end torque than low end. 
Off the line it is a little slugish until it gets up to a certain RPM.  Is
this a 928 trait, or because it is an auto, or a possible need of a tune
up.  As this is my first Porsche I am still getting to know its
characteristics.

As a side note I have noticed that the Porsche newsgroup is pretty useless
on helping 928 owners.  I dont know whether any one else has found this,
but they seem to evolve around 911's and 944's.  Just my last $0.02
worth.Thanks to everyone in advance.  Paul
