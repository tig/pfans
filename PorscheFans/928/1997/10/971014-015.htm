Greetings! Oh Wise and Knowledgeable Shark Pilots!!
I have been merely lurking, (or driving) for a while, but now an issue
has come up that I must send out!
Can the plastic fuel cells for our parsec-munching rockets be repaired,
or must one buy a new tank?
Never, ever, pry on your fuel tank, even _really_ gently...... (don't
ask, I feel stupid already.)
If anyone has a proven solution for repair, or if anyone is parting out
a car, and has a tank, please mail me directly, my digest delivery is
sporadic at best.  ((hartleyk@xmission.com))
On a positive note, replacing the passenger side axle went super
smoothly, Thanks again to David for the great price on the axles!  Also
a smooth job was the replacing of the transmission oil, (5-speeda) with
the exception of filling the trans after, gear oil flows slowly and I
_hate_ the way it smells when you get it on you! (notice I said when,
not if... gear lube falls into the spaghetti sauce/white shirt
catagory!)  I fabricated a super neat tool for getting the plugs out!
Simply put: cut a 1" long chunk off a 17mm alan wrench and glue it into
your Matco 17mm 6-point socket with silicone.  Leave approx 1/2"
protruding and you end up with a super stubby 17mm alan bit that will
stay straight in those shallow plugs when you start pulling!  After the
job you can easily pull the bit out of your socket, or keep it for the
next time!

K.i.s.s.u.!
