The short tales of radar and state troopers vs 928s have been interesting
recently.  Here in Maine, there aren't a terrific number of interesting cars
of any sort, and 928s are particularly scarce.  Unfortunately, EVERY county
sherrif, every city cruiser, and EVERY State Trooper carries radar, because
Maine is a small and poor state, and needs the revenue.  I have even seen
game warden vehicles with radar, because any law enforcement officer in this
state can enforce highway laws.  (Of course a game warden isn't going to
stop cars routinely, but it COULD happen.)

Anyway, when I had the 944, I did not have a detector.  I just felt that I
was not going to need it...just not drive that fast.  I was stopped onlyonce
in the 944, and that was in South Carolina, where I was in line of a dozen
cars travelling at around 90....the trooper stopped the first two cars, and
I was #2.
Nice chap:  $73 bucks, I think.

But here in Maine, when the 928 appeared this Spring, I was a LITTLE
concerned, because I think there are only two 928s in the immediate
area...maybe the whole county, and I was sure that someone might just want
to be a pain with his little radar.  The 928 came with radar detection
installed, which works fine.  

UNFORTUNATELY, the troopers here have a new trick.  With instant on radar,
they are not driving around with the beam out.  They sit and wait until you
are right on them, and at a range of about 150 feet, they hit you.  So,
Unless you are close to someone in front of you who gets zapped first, you
could be right on the trooper's radar gun without knowing that it is even
nearby.  Obviously, clipping along isn't wise.

I drive the 928 a lot during the season, and I will be taking the car to
Florida in November, my first really long trip.  Eastport to KeyWest and
back before the Shark goes to sleep.  But should you guys come up here to
Maine, remember:  it isn't highway safety that is being promoted; just the
treasury of the State of Maine, and they LOVE tourists in their Porsches.....
