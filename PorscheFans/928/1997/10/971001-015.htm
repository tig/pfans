Happy to hear about your "luck" in this situation.  However, I was under
the impression that the brake reservoir is divided in such a way that
you would loose only the front, or the rear, brakes in the event
of a leaky clutch.  Is this belief wrong?  Does the partition in the 
brake fluid reservoir either useless or not present on all model year?

Just trying to get a warm fuzzy feeling about Porsche's engineering
on the subject...
