Hey Jim,

The VIN of the car is WP0ZZZ  which indicates a Euro model.  It has the
typical rear red fog lamp and the side yellow lamps on the front fenders
and all the gauges are in German.  I'm assuming engine in it is stock as
the records I have don't indicate an engine swap.  It has the dual block
cross flow air plenum characteristic of an earlier 32V motor and the
plenum is clearly marked 32V.   Did the "Americanization" of the car
include swapping out the 16V motor with the 32V US model?  Are there
numbers on the motor I can look up to see what it's performance
characteristics are?

Regardless, this thing's a really nice unit.  I think it's a keeper...

Thanks,

Bert

>  If your '86 has the original engine, then the 32v means it was a US spec
