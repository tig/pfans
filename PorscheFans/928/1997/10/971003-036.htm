Ed, I do not have the time to check (I am leaving town in a few hours)
but I wouldlike to know if there is a chance that I can compensate for
60-70 mm ride height.

Does the adjuster have over 20 full turn available?

Wish I had time to check this before I left...

I will try to catch you later during my trip (I will find a way to read
my e-mail...) So I will
be kinda off-line until the 13th or 14th.   Happy driving
