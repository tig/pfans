I'd like to get the straight scoop on what you all think is the reliability 
record of 928s, specifically 1987.

I'm seriously considering getting one and plan on using it as a daily 
driver.  If we can assume that:

- The car was well maintained with documented service records.

- A certified mechanic looked at it and gave it the thumbs-up.

- It has low mileage:  22k.

- Model year 1987.

What can I expect in terms of reliability?  I've owned a 240SX for 6 years 
now and haven't had a single problem with the car.  I really like reliable 
transportation and am wondering if I'll be unhappy with this 928.

I had a 944 a while ago I bought at 54k miles and I had nothing but trouble 
(I didn't follow the above scrutiny).  I'd really like the 928 but I'm 
concerned.

I'd really appreciate your response!
