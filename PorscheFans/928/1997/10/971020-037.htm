Hi all, just returned from a trip through Provence and it has taken two
days to read the list!  France was great!  The mountain roads... my only
regret was to be driving a Ford Mondio, a quarter of the HP I'm used to.  A
number of times I was overtaken by scores of classic race cars speeding
through the Route de Vin or the Grand Corniche in Monti Carlo.  I could not
believe the cars in Monico.

Upon my return I was surprised to be confronted with the dreaded MAGIC
BLOWER SYNDROME again!!!!  Still having a few days off and a fromage
hangover I did some tests.  #1) I found, and this is more weird than
Rodan's "Gates of Hell", when the blower blasts the radar detector goes
off.  #2) It will not happen when the selector switch is set to off, as it
did in the spring. #3) It seems to coincide with the brakes, reverse and
headlights. #4) It happened only twice all summer.  Now it happens all the
time.  #5) It always lasts for 3.5 secs.  #6) I think I read replacing the
resistor pack may not help.  So before I turn it over to the local Picasso,
ahhh... I mean Porsche mechanic any new thoughts?  I am now carring the
fire extinguishers again!
