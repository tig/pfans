Dear fellow =B3Land Shark=B2 tamers:

Kim Crumb and I are in the process of drafting the Panorama article on the
=B3Frenzy=B2 .  Before we proceed too far we would like to get feed-back from
attendees. We are not looking for more compliments, but instead would like
your impressions of what you saw and heard. Tell us what you think was most
important to you and why. Feel free to tell us what was not to your liking
because it either needs improvement or deletion. Fell free to elaborate and
be as specific as possible.

This was your event as much as it was Kim=B9s and mine. We encourage you to
tell us what you think should be covered in the article. This is
particularly true since there was so much going on, and both of us were not
always present. For example, as much as I wanted to be present at the "928
group photo", I could not.  What was said and done at the photo shoot may b=
e
interesting to PCA readers.

Also, some of you attended the demos by Larry Reynolds. As you know, I was
busy doing other tasks, so the information that he provided is not in my
memory banks. I certainly do not want to leave out major aspects that were
covered at the event. The impressions and remarks about his presentations
will be invaluable to us as Kim and I prepare the article.

In addition, there were a few of you that taped some of the event. A
transcript of the tape(s) would be useful in filling in the blanks and to
keep us honest in our report. Send to my e-mail address: eds928s@erols.com
whatever you can.

Thanks in advance for the information you are about to send. Happy motoring=
..
Ed

P.S. Access to a major 928 data base is in the works. I will need volunteer=
s
for various duties in forming the =B3club=B2. Let me know if you can help and i=
n
what capacity. Keep in mind that "all good thing take time and effort".
