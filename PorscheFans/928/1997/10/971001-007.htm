I go unnoticed and everybody around seems to have "hot-shoe" syndrome.

I find it the opposite in CT, when I am in my black '84 928 I have every 
nut in a rice rocket trying to race me.  I laugh most of them off, since 
some of them have put innocent people in danger trying to goat me into 
racing them.  I had one guy that after I beat him on an open stretch of 
road, pass  several cars in the right hand break down lane at 70 mph just 
to get by me!  When I drive my Audi 5000 I drive at the same speeds or 
faster, then the 928 but I go unnoticed by the twenty something backward 
hat wearing rice rocketteers that have to show me they are getting their 
money's worth out of that large car payment each month.  My wife has seen 
this and says that I am doing humanity a good turn when I let these would 
be road warriors blow by me thinking that have just passed a Porsche. 
 While I always say it take small things a amuse small minds.  Sorry but I 
just had to say it.


Old 928's never die we just make them go faster
84S 77k 5-speed Black/Black & slightly enhanced
87 Audi 5000s 200K and still going strong
89 Chevy Blazer
