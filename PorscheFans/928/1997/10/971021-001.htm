Hi Chris,

In response to your 944 vs. 928 question: I've had a '88 944 Turbo S and now
a '90 928 S4.

Here's my $.02 for what it's worth. As you know, the cars are for different
market segments, so what really matters is which segment you are. The 944 was
a great "point and shoot" car. The 5 911's I've had can't compare. I chipped
the engine and it was close to 300hp, up from its stock 247hp. As a road test
stated about the standard turbo (@208hp) "...now finally, the engine has
caught up with the chassis..". I guess that means the the normal 944 is under
engined (or over chassised). The 928 is not a point and shoot car in the same
vein as the 944. It's heavier and more powerful. I'd suggest driving them
both and determine which car is most to your liking.

Good Luck!

John Weber
