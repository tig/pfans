I recently put up a page for a client that might help you in describing the
wheel choices you have:
www.wheelenhancement.com/style.htm

The five spoke, three-piece 'riveted' wheel you describe sounds like the
rare, expensive, heavy and delicate 3.6 Turbo wheel. Typical used price for
these is $3,500-5,000. Even the aftermarket imitations are pricey. For that
matter, all 3-piece wheels are kind of expensive. You might consider the C2
Turbo one-piece.

The skinny- spoke 16s you describe are available in limited sizes,  but
they're fairly cheap.
