I have a 1980 928 purchased in August, 48K miles, no big problems. As
the weather has recently turned cooler, I turned on the heating on a one
hour trip. No matter what setting the temp slider or duct slider were on
the air never heated up. The engine temp indicator was in an appropriate
position. Car has new thermostat, A/C works as one would expect. Any
ideas?

The HVAC system uses pnuematic valves to actuate the flaps to direct the
airflow to the footwells, front window (defrost) as well as recirculate air
(max AC) and also to control the coolant going to the heater core.  You
could have a problem with this heater core valve.  This particular valve
will develop problems sooner than the others because it is in the engine
compartment rather than under the dash (and it is plastic).  The valves are
actuated off the intake vaccuum.

If your cruise conrol ever fails to operate, it is probably a vaccuum
problem.  If the HVAC system acts up (If for instance on Max AC the system
cools but not sufficiently) or the flaps do not operate at all it could be
a vaccuum problem.  There is a vaccuum hose connector on the driver side of
the engine right in front of the master cylinder.  This connector can come
apart with age as the rubber hardens.  It is the first place to look if you
lose vaccuum.

Anyway, since your AC is working correctly, then you can assume there is no
vaccum problem.  I would check the valve for the heater core .  If you
remove the air filter housing, you can see a hose coming off the block and
through the firewall.  The valve is connected to this hose (maybe 3/4 inch
diameter).  Might also be a good time to renew this hose.

You can test the valve by connecting a hand vaccuum pump to the hose which
runs to the valve and then watching the valve to see if it actuates.  There
is a connector under the center consol on the driver's side (it is attached
to the hump near the bottom of the stereo).  There are five or so (I think
the older cars had 6) solenoids which control the vaccuum hoses.  You can
test the any or all of the valves from this connector.

BTW, the HVAC valves will fail as the rubber bladders in them get old and
tear.  In my '85 I replaced them all at around 100K miles.  My AC was all
messed up, but worked like new after the repair.  These valves are also
very 'strategically placed' and difficult to find/replace.  For instance,
to replace the fresh air/recirc valve, you need to remove the hood, then
the fresh air blower, and then the big flapper door with the valve on it.

Sorry so long.  Tell us if this is the fix.
