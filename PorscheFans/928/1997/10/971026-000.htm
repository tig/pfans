" Re Ed's request for involvement, surprised this topic hasn't seen more

ink, especially given the size and enthusiasm of the "frenzy"
gathering."

***
I think there's lots of surprises in store for us...  but we do need
everyone's help and I've asked for assistance as well.  Numerous
webpages & contributors show how committed we are already and we need to
help support them as our own, for example the FAQ is worth it's weight
in gold:
1.  928 FAQ
2.  928 Registry / Group gallery
3.  928 Classifieds
3.  928 General info / Owners gallery
more sites coming online all the time

Our infrastructure needs help organizing and Ed is going a long way
toward getting this accomplished.  We have a great bunch of fans willing
to help like James Morrison, Brian Buxton, Leonard Laub, Alan Ng,
myself, (sorry if I'm volunteering for anyone by mistake but if not us
928 fans then who) etc.


" Since I'm relatively new to the page, this question may have already
been addressed...is Phil's 928 Owners Group the foundation of what we're

trying to do?"

***
I hope it will be the genesis to get us going.  There have been previous
attempts (Phil Kalamaros/Mark Anderson/Kim Crumb with  the Land Shark
Track and Street Club - lst&sc) but like the 928 the timing may not have
been right - too ahead of it's time?  So here we are now, though we've
seen the demise of the 928 as a production Porsche it's following has
never been as fierce as now!  You all ready to make some history?  Yes
you are!!!  Already did too!  50+ 928s at each get together!


" Speaking of which, what ARE we trying to do?  Anyone draft a mission
statement?  Seems Kim and Ed voiced a lot of salient specifics at the
frenzy. Are they written anywhere?  I'd be happy to give bylaws a shot
if someone will steer me in the right direction re our purpose."

Yeah, let's get this down on paper (listserv?)
ex. the POC (Porsche Owners Club) is a driving oriented club, etc.
ex. the PCA is ____
ex. the 928 Owners Club is  ____

I suggest we follow PCA bylaws etc. as they are well-grounded and
established  One of those try not to reinvent the wheel situations.

Ok, I'm going to go way out on limb here:  We are in conflict of
interest with the PCA so will not be able to form under them (imagine
all the other private clubs crying foul even if we could pull it off).
But we're definately not trying to replace them by any means (impossible
anyways) but trying to create something 928-specific to fill the gaps
they don't provide.

And what do you all think of separate annual dues to produce this
928-specific stuff?  Only way we can pay for mailing of newsletters
(check it out Alan volunteered to do the printing for us) , internet
costs, obtain fund raising items, business registrations, acctg fees
(what no volunteers?), legal aid even (ditto),  etc etc   I could go on
/ let's not forget insurance if we get ambitious and rent a track
someday.

So yes this is big time & for real but you know every time I go to the
bookstore and see Forza mag I think the 928 and I as a 928 owner deserve
this too!

Ambitious yes, and that's why I'm doing my grassroots efforts.    I am
rambling.  Too tired I guess.  Feel free to cut/paste/reply as wanted.

Phil
