Michael,
I am using the 80-140w that is for street or race, not the "shockproof"
full-blown race lube. I use the 80-140 because I run my 79 Euro HARD everyday,
and plan on lots of track time with it in the future.
I use the Redline 75W90NS in my 89 S4 5-speed with is not driven nearly as much
as the 79. I have noticed dramatic differences in the way the trans shifts on
both of my 928s after changing to Redline Gear Lube and recommend it highly.

 I have also heard the same great results from other 928 owners who have changed
to Redline, Amsoil, and Mobile 1 syn. gear lube. It seems to be more of a
personal preference as to which brand to use, but there is no doubt that it
should be a good quality synthetic.
