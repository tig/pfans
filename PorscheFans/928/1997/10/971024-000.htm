it doesnt have all that much more kick than my 79 US car, at least until 4000
rpm.  After that, it comes alive, whereas my old car  sort of runs out of
steam.  One note, though, I have been told by several people that it is a
stronger running car than the 288 HP 85 5 speed I once owned.  That's a load
of BS.  My 85 would have blown the doors off of this supposed 300 hp euro
car.  All of them were/are 5 speeds...

The 928S used to earn quite a bit of critizism in Europe for its relatively
poor low-end torque. Many people felt that a Grand Tourisme car should offer
more torque, and Porsche reacted to this critizism to some degree in the
later cars. However, I must say that considering it is supposed to have
316HP, even my S4 is kind of tired under 4000 RPM ...

The reason why you feel the '85 US model is faster might be its higher
low-end torque and overall more consistent torque curve, which mainly results
from the higher displacement of 5 Liters vs. the 4.7 liters of the Euro S
engine. 

This is why I feel the absolute HPs don't tell you much about how fast a car
will go (WARNING: long background story follows!).

Before I moved to the US I had an '86 Mazda RX7 (150HP Rotary in German
version). When I came here I bought an '89 Probe LX with a 2.2 Liter 112HP
12-valve 4-cylinder. This engine has such wonderful low end torque because of
its high displacement per cylinder (this is very familiar to 968 drivers with
their 3 Liter, 4 cylinder engine) that I tend to believe an RX7 could not
beat me up to about 30 mph - unless its driver revs up the engine like crazy
before releasing the clutch. 

While the RX7 was probably the best HANDLING car (Weissach style rear axle,
speed sensitive power steering, and less bulky than the 928) I feel that for
everyday driving here in the US there is more benefit in the low-end torque
of the Probe's engine. I still drive that old clunker (actually, it's a year
younger than my S4) to work and for shopping, and enjoy it's consistent
torque and resulting low fuel consumption (about half of the 928). 

Sorry for the long "background story"...

There is no replacement for displacement!
