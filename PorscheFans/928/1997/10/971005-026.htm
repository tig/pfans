Hmmm... and to think about a year ago I was contemplating trading my SE for
a '94 M3.  I don't know what specs the M3 has in the US, but here they will,
on paper at least, match the 928. (Like, 0-60 in about 5.5 secs.)

As it turned out I am VERY glad I didn't.  The final smile was finding
myself coming onto the back straight on the circuit a couple of weeks ago
along side an early 90's M3.  We accelerated side by side to just over
100mph and then the M3 started to become a purple dot in the rear view
mirror. Ahhhh....
