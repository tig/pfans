Regarding the recent discussion about forming a 928 Club; there is now an
official Porsche 928 Club in Germany.  As many of you know, Porsche AG has
a Porsche Club Activities Coordinator (until recently Ilse Nadele, now
Stella Stieber); the factory also recently started sending a newsletter
about worldwide Porsche Club activities to PCA officers in the US (I'm
receiving it as Past President of Suncoast Florida Region); anyway, the
current edition of Porsche Club News (3/97), which just recently caught up
with me, had the news that the Porsche 928 Club had been formed; club
president is Tobias Aichele, former National Press Officer for Porsche AG.
If anyone is interested, the address is;

Mr. Tobias Aichele
Wannenstrasse 38
70199 Stuttgart
Fax (+49)0711/6 40 20 02

The article mentioned that the club has over 40 members with 928 models
dating from all years.  "Club activities are to focus on the issue of a 928
Register and assistance in preserving the V8 sports car which was chosen as
"Car of the Year" in 1978"
