Really??  Hmmm -that's not what I heard.  I understood the whole =
drive-train to be solid as a rock.  Maybe the later cars have a =
different clutch system?  Certainly the only week link in the chain, and =
the thing that breaks first, is the part where the tyres touch the =
road!!

I don't often take off with smoke filling the rear guards, but it's nice =
to know that I can let the hoon in me out sometimes and do it.  (Oh - =
and I do have an LSD.)

I was just viewing the archives and on Oct 1 1996 (4th message) someone
suggests that the way to determine if one has a limited slip is to drop
the clutch and burn rubber. DONT EVE$$R!  928's and 944's have fragile
platic fingers in the clutch that will be destroyed doing this.  I know
someone who ruined their 944 after one single clutch drop.  Porsche's
are fine crafted precision machines and not meant for abuse like
primitive 60's musclesleds (which I've had too).
