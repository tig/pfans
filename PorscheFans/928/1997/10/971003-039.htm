Dear Stephane:

I'm not sure that it has that much adjustment travel. However, I do know
that my front end was
off by over 30mm and that I was able to bring it well within specs. Orhter
things I forgot to mention are air pressure, tire condition, and wheel
bearings. Make sure the pressure is at or slightly more than required on
relatively good tires (lots of tread left) and that the wheel bearings are
properly set. One more thing. You may be able to raise the front a bit more
if you lower the rears accordingly. Think of the cars suspension as a
see-saw with the center of the car as a fulcrum. However, you must take care
not to over-do the rear adjustment as this can affect handling in an adverse
manner.

Good luck and happy motoring. Ed
