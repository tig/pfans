Very nice set up you made for your taping efforts in the 928...A friend
and I
did some of the same at Texas World Speedway this past Sept and we just
took
a  camera mounted it on a tripod and then bungee corded (in a BIG kind
of
way) that whole unit to the passenter side back seat, leaned the
passenger
side front seat WAY back and viola!!  Instant (ok almost, it did take
about
10 min to bungee it into the car) track video. Now we are not nearly as
fast
or experienced as you but we did ok.  We both drove in the Yellow run
group
and I was passed by few people, but I have a long way to go before I
really
feel like I am a good driver (amazing what a few trips to the track will
do
to your ego! ;) ).

Uh hmmm, thanks for the above compliment but it's not true - this is my
second year of track driving (last year was only 3 days and it rained
the first 2) and I certainly don't consider myself fast.  I am however
having a great time and getting faster.  (I am also (now) perfectly
content to be patient in achieving better results and sometimes you end
up improving more quickly than you expected.)

I hope the bungee cording was BIG.  I'm not sure our region's tech
inspectors would buy it - please be sure that thing won't come loose in
an 80 mph head-on impact.  If you stop from 80 mph in 4 ft, the
*average* acceleration is over 50 g's meaning that a 5 lb setup exerts
an average force of more than 270 pounds on those bungee cords and the
peak force is no doubt considerably higher.

I really like Phil's setup of a seperate camera - that way the recording
device can be safely bolted somewhere else and the high mounted thing is
really light.

The footage is wonderful - it's really useful to review how the day
went, what you did wrong, and where you might improve and no doubt a
great thing to watch BEFORE showing up at the track the next time.  I
think this is especially important when you don't have an instructor
along for the ride and also for autoX, where you don't get to go through
the turn 500 times before adding serious speed.

Cheers,
Kurt

PS - watch out for that ego!  It can very quickly bite you - I almost
went there in my first few track days.  (Perhaps you meant confidence.)
In the spirit of those immortal words from Clint, "A driver's GOT to
know his limitations."
