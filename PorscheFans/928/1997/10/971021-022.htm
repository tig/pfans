Dave:

You have symptoms often associated with plugged exhaust.  Before we get too
carried away,  we are assuming that the other mechanical condition of the
engine is OK.  A compression check is a yardstick measurement to make sure
we're not fighting a holed piston or bad valves.

Plugged exhaust is diagnosed with a vacuum gauge attached to the intake
manifold.  With the gauge attached and visible while you drive, try
accelerating gently on level ground while watching the gauge.  If it rises
to atmospheric with no load change while accelerating, look at the catalysts
for blockage.  Under normal circumstances,  a steady foot will have the
manifold pressure drop under rising RPM, thanks to the engine's attempt to
pump more mass at higher RPM.  The steady throttle is the key here.

Plugged cats frequently cause oil leaks, as the crankcase pressure rises and
there's no scavenging of the burnt gasses into the intake system.

Hope this helps.  Cats aren't cheap these days,  but still better than
chasing your tail for the solution.


Good luck, and please let me know how good my amateur diagnosis turns out.

Subject: High RPM Pulling Power

Greetings:

Question, has anyone encountered this problem:

I have an 82 928, 3 sp auto, 56K, runs great, except it will not pull
above 4300 RPM in 3rd gear, or its equivalent of about 5700 in 2nd gear.
As I rarely get a chance to run this fast I was not aware of the problem
(Denver traffic is horrible at all hours that I am out). The car acts
like one that has reached its top speed, but this is only about 110 mph
(85 mph speedo). The manual says that the auto should go 140, about 5500
RPM in 3rd which is logical as the peak torque is at 4000 RPM and peak
horsepower at 5500 RPM.

The car has a new Borla exhaust and K&N air filter so flow should not be
the problem. The engine idles smooth and runs strong in first gear (till
5500 RPM). There is not indication of bucking or missing at the higher
speeds, it just won't go. 

Thanks,

Dave.
