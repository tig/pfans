Ok, the above is correct syntax for whois, but the following is wrong:

> mnkbox:~>nslookup NS.NETWORKMERCENARIES.COM porschephiles@tta.com
> *** Can't find server address for 'porschephiles@tta.com': Unknown host
[snip]

nospam: {57} nslookup menelaos@starnet.net
Server:  ns1.HiWAAY.net
Address:  208.147.144.2

*** ns1.HiWAAY.net can't find menelaos@starnet.net: Non-existent host/domain
nospam: {58}

See? nslookup is not going to be able to resolve porschephiles@tta.com,
couldn't, and shouldn't, because its an email address, not a host. You
could use nslookup to determine where mail destined for tta.com goes,
but that's a different animal.

About the only way to prove an email address exists is to send mail
to it and get a reply. No reply doesn't prove anything. An error reply
proves you get an error message.
