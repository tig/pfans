Greetings!

I found an 81 euro S in our paper this weekend, and gave in to temptation.  I
have always kind of wanted a gray-market 928, and I guess I now have one.
  It's white with the funky checkerboard inserts in the seats, in black.
 Decent car.  Solid as a rock, and just seems to need a little TLC, mostly
cosmetics.  I had never driven one of these before, and I am surprised that
it doesnt have all that much more kick than my 79 US car, at least until 4000
rpm.  After that, it comes alive, whereas my old car  sort of runs out of
steam.  One note, though, I have been told by several people that it is a
stronger running car than the 288 HP 85 5 speed I once owned.  That's a load
of BS.  My 85 would have blown the doors off of this supposed 300 hp euro
car.  All of them were/are 5 speeds.  I am still happy to get it, however.
 God, I love these suckers!
