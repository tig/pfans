Yep.

Ed Ruiz and others are working on it.

>keep marks connection with poc solid

Good idea, particularly for those in SoCal (apparently not very numerous,
or at least very vocal, on this list, by the way).

You betcha! A solid Web site and highly interactive e-mail list and chat
room must be part of the core services of such a club.

>face it, there are lots of us, and we are everywhere

Key facts which underlay the idea of a club. There's no good reason for 928
visibility to be so low among PCA, the parts and accessories aftermarket,
repair shops, you name it. Each of us has been conditioned to be surprised
to see another 928, but there really are lots of them.

>reality interfering with our automotive lives

Ain't it a shame?

>i think we need to have an identity that is recognizable, and will allow us
>to be somebody a force to reckon with

Yep.
