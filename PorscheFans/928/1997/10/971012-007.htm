>I have enjoyed this mailing list (especially the road-kill).  Several of
you have mentioned your low mileage cars and i was wondering if anyone had a
story about a "high mileage car" or old faithful.

Mike,

I have an '88 SE - the fore-runner to the GT - which has done 97,000 miles
and is still tight as a drum.  Coming from a long history of British sports
cars that rattle I can't believe how good this old beast still is and how
strong the engine and gearbox are.  I bought it about a year ago with 89,000
miles on the clock  and had it pretty thoroughly checked out,  spending
another 5 grand on tyres, brakes and the normal 928 niggly faults (rear
hatch release, interior light...) and then went out and drove it like
they're meant to be driven.

I used it everyday for a few months, but this came to an end when someone
dropped a sledgehammer off a truck in front of me and took out the
undertray, air-con, steering bushes and miscellaneous other small items.  I
bought a 205GTi as a town car and now the 928 only gets driven when I need
the adrenaline.  (Most weekends.)

Apart from an alternator pulley coming loose last Christmas (causing the
dash to, appropriately,  light up like a Christmas tree) it hasn't missed a
beat.  I've had it around the circuit, 140mph down the back straight and
braking from 100m for the hairpin from that speed.  Unlike my Lotuses the
928 still had plenty of oil pressure and wasn't running more than 5 degrees
above normal at the end of 15 laps.

It's pure magic!

Regards,

Philip Adamson
