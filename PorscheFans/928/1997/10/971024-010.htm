This car has had all of the belts (including timing), hoses, seals,
gaskets, and vacuum lines recently replaced.  The engine's cam covers
and intake manifold have been sandblasted and powder-coated.  The
transmission was removed, resealed, steam cleaned and replaced.  It has
a new steering rack, brake rotors, brake pads, master cylinder and
tires.  The console switches have been replaced.  There are no fluid
leaks on this immaculate car.  The engine compression resembles that of
a new car.  The transmission shifts perfectly.  It was my daily driver
and has been auto-crossed 10 times.  It is dependable and competitive in
the KP class.  It has 103,000 miles.  I replaced it with a 1995 968.  

THIS CAR IS PRICED BELOW RETAIL KELLEY BLUE BOOK AT 18,000 DOLLARS.

I welcome and encourage prospective buyers to bring this car to a
mechanic of your choice and have it thoroughly checked out before
purchasing.  The nine volume factory repair manuals are included.
