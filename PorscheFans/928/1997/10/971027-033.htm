No help for you from me unfortunately, But I wanted to mention im in a =
similar dilemma. I (usually) have a very good memory of such things, so =
when i took off my door skin to re-upholster it and came back the next =
week to hook it up from memory, i must have gotten two wires crossed. =
all of the mirror functions work except the switch for left-right is =
backwards on the passenger side. I am 'living with it' for now but when =
i take the skin off again for some speaker improvements I intend to make =
it right.

A side note in this vein - The PO had a sound fetish and my car came =
equipped with a '90 Alpine CD player + amp + 8 speaker setup. 4 of the =
speakers were in the doors and NOT in factory mounting positions. What =
some genius had done is expanded the hole that you use to get to the =
door lock/windows mechanism by cutting the sheetmetal, then they made =
cheap plywood cutouts and mounted the speakers with screws and silicon. =
They SOUNDed nice but the boards were deteriorating and because the =
speakers were so heavy (Rockford Fosgate punch 40's,2 per door, 6 inch =
speakers @ ~ 4.5lbs per) they rattled a little when the door closed. =
Anyway, i had a local steelworks place use the plywood template to =
machine me some real bolt in replacements, and I have to tell you the =
difference is real. I love getting pounded in the torso by these =
powerful mid-range speakers.

>This is my first 928, I have had a 914 and=20
>a couple of 924's, so this  could be considered my first >Porsche if =
you're a purist who consider 914's and 924's >as Volkswagens/Audi's with =
Porsche badges.

When I was 16 my first car was a 924. I used to think I was the coolest =
kid in the world, it was so fun. I picked up this girl from a coffee =
shop, and I liked her, so I was digging to see if she liked me at all... =
Anyway, I mentioned something about the cost of a part for my porsche to =
my friend and all of a sudden my date said 'This is a porsche?'. She =
said it with awe and after that the date was a little different..

People are wierd. I say have fun with your car and who cares what kind =
it is. All I know is I've always wanted a 928, it seems silly but I've =
wanted one since I saw 'wierd science'...=20
