Bill, it could be any number of things.  Here's two that bit me.

(1) Fuel pressure regulator.  You have two of them in the rear of the
engine compartment.  I was tooling along on the freeway and the engine
stopped DEAD.  Just like that, no warning, no spooling down, just dead.
Pulled over, tweaked things, started up and went on.  Took it to the
mechanic and after several false starts he found the regulators weren't
working properly and weren't letting fuel get to the engine.

(2) Loose wire.  Had some a/c work done and somehow a yellow wire leading
into the bunch of wires (I love that technical talk!) where the hot start
jumper gizmo is (right front side of the engine compartment) had come
loose.  The mechanic just shoved it back in and presto!  instant ignition.


There's a lot of reasons for engines to quit, so it's unlikely that your
problem is one of these, but...  

Good luck!!!
