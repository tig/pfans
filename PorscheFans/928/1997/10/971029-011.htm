There is not much recourse if your trim is scratched other than
re-anodize, paint or replace.  However if it's just dull, from the years
this may help.  I used a product called "Black Again" and it worked
great.  For the best results, apply in the shade on cool trim, use very
sparingly and really work it in.  Then park it in the bright sun for it
to work as it's UV activated.  

TIP: When done, your fingers should really hurt from all that rubbing.
One application kept my black trim, including the rubber bumpers and
spoiler looking black and new for nearly two years.  Granted it's garage
kept and only goes out on nice days, but I never had such long lasting
results from any other product.
