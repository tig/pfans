In an attempt to keep the dual cats on my '85 from destroying the torque
tube, I replaced my cats with a bypass pipe for about a 3 year period.  I
noticed no difference in power and the car was extremely loud (especially
at full throttle).  I was glad I kept the cats in the corner of the garage
and happily put them back on after the factory recall to install the heat
shield over the converters.

As far as lowering the car goes, drive with care.  In the same stock '85 I
destroyed the oil pan on a starter motor lying in the road,  and tore off
the entire bottom of the AC compressor on a bad expansion joint (lying
under the car I could look up at the compressor piston).  Needless to say,
I lost my $250 core charge!  I think I replaced the front air dam 3 or 4
times over the life of the car (parking curbs).
