The lock is like new, it was only installed for a day.  This is the
complete setup, the lock cylinder with key down to the latch that
inserts into the body.   

It is not likely to match your current key.  You may be able to knock
out the pin and put in your lock cylinder, maybe.  I could not find it
documented in the shop manual.  If you need a new lock assembly for your
hatch, make an offer.  I'm guessing postage will run about $3, seems
like it's about 1-2 pounds in weight. 

I came about this item as the hatch on my '84 928S would not open with
the power release when I bought it from a dealer.  The dealer agreed to
fix it as part of the deal and their service tech ordered a new lock
assembly.  They put it in, but no change.  

Next day while giving the car a good cleanup, I found the in-line fuse
and magic, the lock now made a single revolution and all worked well.  I
put the original lock back in so the keys would match up again and all
was still well.  I packed the lock away in it's original box and forgot
about it until I cleaned up the garage this past weekend.  Since I have
no need, I thought I'd offer it up.
