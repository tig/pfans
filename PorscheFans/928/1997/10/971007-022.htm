Can anyone recommend a source and model numbers for replacement speakers?
I've got a '79 928 with what look like originals in the doors and a poor
non-factory replacement in the rear.

I've had out the fronts.  They are the small ovals (~3" x 4" from
memory)with the magnet & coil assembly mounted forward/inside. The
dimple/cavity/recess in the sheet metal of the door has a solid rubber
cylinder glued as though it is supposed to be a bumper.  The dimple is very
small and shallow with no room for a conventional speaker and its rear
magnet assembly.

I've not had out the rears but they are clearly aftermarkets.  For one,
there are the tell-tale mounting screws conspicous in the middle of the
factory grille holes.  For another the panel is pushed up by the speakers
creating a gap of almost an inch.  Looking through the rear quarter window
into the gap with a flashlight, the speaker's conventional magnet can be
seen resting against the recessed sheet metal.

What do you suggest?
