First, on standard Porsche LSD's.  Neither on  951's  (944 turbo) nor on 928's
have I EVER seen an option code 220 irrespective of whether or not the car came
with a LSD from the factory.  The only reliable way (certainly sellers are not)
I've gotten this info is by calling PCNA (1-800-545-8039) and giving the VIN
(or by dropping the clutch or jacking up the car).

Up to '90 or '91, LSD's were optional (except on the '89 up GT's for which they
were standard - and '88 CS of course) and after one of those years the LSD's
were the fancy variable proportioning type.  Somebody will set both of us
straight on which year (and I forget the name at the moment).

Best,
Kurt
'87 S4 5sp no LSD
