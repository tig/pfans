I thought the two guides would sove my problem. I order them from dealer.
 Only these are shown in the Europarts catalogue.  My window also had a clunk
at the end of the tavel when lowered.  

Since I had no time, I took to dealer.  It is fixed and works very well;
however there were 2 more parts needed.  Neither seemed to appear in shop
manual which is not very definitive.  guides--92853728902
&92853725902...about $34....aditional insert 92853728502 $1.40 &
spacer..91142308102   $17.00...    Labor 3 hours and they knew what they were
doing.  Car was tied up 2 days because the $1.40 part had to come from Reno.

BTW, these are driver's side numbers.
