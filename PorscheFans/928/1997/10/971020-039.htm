Well, it's been about 10 years since I've owned and driven a 944 so my
opinion wouldn't be that reliable.  But, to dodge your question a little I
would say the 968 corners and handles better than the 928 in general.  I
occasionally drive my wife's 968 and am always impressed with its handling -
it feels like its on rails.   To be fair, I don't drive the 968 enough to
feel comfortable pushing it too hard - but it's terrific where I've taken
it.

The only reason I bothered to post was that the 968 was the successor to the
944 - although it feels to me like somewhat of a different car altogether
than the 944 in some ways.  I"m not sure there are the volumes of 968's for
sale that you're interested in - just thought I'd pitch my two cents.
