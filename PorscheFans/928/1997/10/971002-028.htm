I called up this insurer but they won't insure me, as I haven't been
driving for more than nine years.


*****Does anyone know of an agreed or stated value insurer that does
business in MA, please help. I've got over $30k invested in my car, and I'm
not covered for more than $13k, all while paying a $3,500 premium (no
tickets, etc).****

Please help,

Paul H.
