   Hi James,

   Glad to hear about your driver's school, sounds like you had yourself
a ball. How many schools have you been to? 

  Last year we had 6 928's at one event, but since then I've been the
only one out there. Last weekend's mix was: 1 928, 4 944s, about 100 BMWs,
most of which were M3s, and a few RX7s  

  I was lucky to keep all four wheels on the road this weekend, but like
you, I've used my car as a landscaping tool a few times. Buttonwillow is a
good place to try to push the envelope, there are no walls an plenty of
runoff if you get in trouble. ( Yes, I meant to come out of that turn at 70mph
just not sideways )  

  As far as your tires are concerned, brand new tires are going to be
quite a bit less grippy. They will feel better once the thread gets lower.
I'm still running on street tires only because of the hassle of carrying
arround a second set of wheels, and the fact that these events are 
eating all my car budget. Specially since my wife runs her car as well.
What can we say,  we're hooked.
 I feel the need !

   My frind Mark sent me this reply, and I think it also applies
 to a few of you. :)
