 Sorry to here about the misfortune, Josh.  But, alas, you are not alone. 
I have many similar stories; I'll relate the last one...
 Earlier this year, I was at a PCA event in Corpus Christi, Texas running 
the practice lapping setions (20 min. each)  I was doing pretty well for 
quite a while, lapped a Mustang, another 928, and other non-descript 
P-cars.  Right as I went under the Mustang entering a long straight, at 
that instance, I could have sworn I heard The Rattling...lifted a split 
second... rattling goes away (thinking: This *can't* be detonation!?), 
nailed it again to preserve my position, then....  plumes and plumes of 
white smoke POURING out the exhaust, instantly looked at the temp. 
gauge...Pegged.  Now, this is the moment that most of us have pondered, 
thinking what will it FEEL like to loose a (Euro) 928 engine.  Not good.  
Especially since I had driven the car to the event 300 miles away.
 When I got it back to the pits,  I lifted the hood to find new smells, 
instant heat burn (my face), plastic pieces showing phase changes, etc.  
The top of the valve covers were so hot that a drop of water INSTANTLY 
vaporized, as on a skillet.  Man this engine got HOT!  I would estimate 
300 deg. F or more.  Well, I thought, that's it.  I wanted to build a new 
engine anyway, now the issue is forced.
 I returned the next day to watch the actual event, at which time I 
decided to see *how* bad this thing is damaged.  I started filling the 
resorvoir with water to find out THERE WAS NONE in the engine.  I found 
the lower radiator hose had come off and I had lost all my water during 
the 20 min., full-throttle action yesterday.  No wonder!, I thought.  
Anyway, I tightened the hose clamp, continued filling the everything back 
up and decided to see what would happen if I tried to crank it.  The 
thing fired up immediately (just like normal)! Well, then I'm SURE that 
the head-gaskets are toast, and I would still have to have it towed back. 
 I monitored the car idling for many minutes, but it was not loosing 
water. So I took it for a short test-drive...seemed fine, so I decided to 
limp it back home with lots of water jugs available. One thing I noticed 
right off, was that the idle sound was definitely different.  No one else 
could tell, but *I* could hear something different.
 Anyway, drove it home (with no additonal water, either).  Rather than 
continue to let my immagination run wild with all the things that could 
be wrong internally, I decided to check everything.  Turns out the only 
thing wrong with the engine was #7 cylinder had only 55lbs static 
compression!  Head gaskets, valves, mains, everything else was fine!  The 
compression ring on #7 had relaxed and was allowing blow-by, and this 
accounted for the slightly, odd-sounding (to me) idle. Beyond 2500rpm, 
full power is there.
 Message: These engines are far and away the best in engineering and have 
the best materials and workmanship.
 Sorry for the length.

Marc
