I would call TnT (phone number should be in your yellow pages under Auto
- Transportation).  They're the only NATIONAL firm I know that hauls
their own vehicles.  All the others I know of are broker only.  If
there's any damage, you are in the middle of a circle jerk.

Make sure that your car is washed and that the driver signs off to the
fact that the car is clean and no damage including scratches, dents,
dings, etc.  Upon arrival, make sure to check the car throughly before
accepting it.  If it is dirty, write an addendum on the bill of lading
reserving the right to file a claim after the vehicle is cleaned and
inspected.

Finally, pay with a VISA or MC so that at a minimum you can dispute the
bill in case of conflict.

At all costs, avoid bubba's auto haulers.  If you transport with a
non-national carier, or a broker of any kind, you will likely get
piss-poor service and a damaged vehicle in the end.
