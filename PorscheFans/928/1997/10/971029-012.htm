Sounds like a fun project.   Something I will consider should the motor
die in my 928.  I've seen these kits advertised in the past and was
always curious about them.  Was it complete, or did you need to
fabricate some items?  Was the kit well documented and thorough?  What
does the kit minus engine go for? 

How does the Chevy motor hook up the drive train?  I imagine you are
using a Chevy flywheel/clutch that cost less than a grand? What does
this drive, the stock torque tube, tranny, etc?  

Have you found any testimony as to how much power the remaining 928
Drivetrain can handle?  Any concerns there?  

Let us know how it runs and handles after you get it all done, tuned and
are driving it for awhile.  I'd be interested to hear your impressions.
Hopefully you can post pictures someplace on the net of the business
side of it all.

Thanks,
Bill Smyth
