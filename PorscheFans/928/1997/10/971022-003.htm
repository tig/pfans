Porsche 928 are a great cars.  No butts about it!
We all know the maintance is 3x higher, we just can not help it to owned a
928.

FOR All new 928 owners, watch out for repair bill on the car.  It is very
expensive and need alot of attention.  You heard it from me!  A tune up can
cost $200 easy.  A set of wires cost $150 (oem) to $400 (hotwires).  Even the
oils can go up to 10 Qts.   Clutch, how about $1,000 and higher..   Cost to
drive a mile in my 928 about $3 .  I get 10 miles to a gallon.  or $25 get me
about 160 miles or 200 on highway, plus maintance.  

When you buy a CHEAP 928 and you think it is a bargin. Think again!  Lets say
a $5,000 928 (from 1979-1984) is a good buy.  Usually it is, but the first
tune up will cost $200.  Keep in mine that you need at least $2,000 to do all
the maintance that a 928 needs in the next 6 months.  You probly think I'm
crazy, maybe I'm or just given you a waring!  PARTS for 928 are 3X more than
Hondas, Toyotas, Fords, Chev....

A $5,000 928 can run up $4,000  for the Ist year you owned. Just repair
only.. and when you wants to sell it, you can not get back what you paid
for....!

Let see how many of  928er have another friend owned a 928.  probly not many
(not counting your friends at Porschefans.).  and most owners will own it for
a few years.   Reason can be many, but they will tell you are  1. Insurance
2. Maintance bills  3. I only drive it once a week ( eat too much gas ) 4. I
brought a lemon (keep breaking, if not this is that!)
..............................been there, heard that!

I owned a 928 for 7 years now ( I was 20 years old) , and still loving it
every moments of it.  I drive it daily and long trips to Reno from S.F  No
problem at all.  It needs to be driven...........it only break down if you
don't drive it! ( you hear it from me).
It cost alot to repairs,  
When I brought the 928, cost me $7,200 cash.  first to fix(turn up) are
Clutch, water pump, hoses, belts......$1,200 for the first month to own it.
 It does not matter which years your 928 is, Its EXPENSIVE!  .

Here is the fun part, All (some) 928ers can not leave your 928 alone, like
upgrades.  New set of wheels 17" or 18" can cost from $2,000-$4,000 a set.
 Good sound stero cost $500-$1500 higher.  Body kits $500-$5,000.  This is a
OPTION not a repair bills.

A $5,000 928 can run up another $5,000 if you want to drive it daily.
