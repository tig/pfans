Hi Will,

Sorry for the confusion about using the VIN to obtain info about the alarm.

What I meant is that the factory can lookup the options (i.e. alarm) on your
car, based upon your VIN. The VIN itself doesn't contain that information.
They only use it as a reference.

I had the dealer provide a valet key for my car with this method, since it
didn't have one when I bought. They told me the reason for the license and
registration is to prove you're the owner. They told me (and I took it at
face value) that some people in the past had gotten the VIN for cars that
they would want to break into or steal. The info about alarms and car stereo
options was then given to the would be thieves. So, now they require proof of
ownership.

As a side, I also found out that having a local shop cut an original blank is
tough. The factory key is steel, like most German cars. Howerver, most
American car keys are brass. The machines to cut keys at most of the local
shops cut only brass and can't cut steel. I've found some that can provide a
brass key with a gereric plastic key head (not lit). PCNA does the cutting
when ordered through the dealer and they are steel.

Sorry for the confusion and I hope that clears it up.

John Weber
