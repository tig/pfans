Hello 928 owners.I bought a 1988 S4 Blk,5speed,48k miles mint.The car is
beautiful.I really enjoy the experience of driving it as a 2nd car and
driving my
1995 Grand Cherokee as my main transportation. I paid 18000 which a think
is fair considering the timing belt broke at 35k and PCA replaced the top end
for
PO($7K warranty repair).
Here is a list of the repairs since I bought it 980 miles ago(2 mo)
1. I had the clutch pedal going to floor brake fluid everywhere
experience.New slave
    cylinder fixed that.(first towing experience with a flatbed I learned you
have to
    have  a 2x6 for little ramps to keep the front from dragging.


2. The  small plastic shift mechanism you guys have discussed broke and stuck
     in 4th gear, fortunately I made it home and scheduled that towing the
next day
     because it smelled like my clutch was getting hot.(this time I was  new
to get
     the 2x6 since I had lost my towing virginity.
3.  The ABS relay had to be replaced last week.

 4. Now my cooling fans won't shut off.I pulled the fuses and put them back
in and
     the fans shut off.When I turned on the key again the fans came back on
and won't
     shut off.I pulled the hood release to turn them off this time.Is there a
temp sensor
     telling the fans not to shut off?

     It sounds like the these repairs are fairly typical,so I have 2
questions
     Does anyone know a good 928 mechanic is the Dallas area ?
     Should I paint my 2x6s black to match my car or leave them natural to
match
     my linen interior?
