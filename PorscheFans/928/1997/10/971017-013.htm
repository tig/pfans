     I feel better about my decision of car transport.
     
     I found my 91 GT at the Porsche Dealer in Wallingford, Connecticut 
     ---I live on the other coast---Vancouver, Washington. The dealer 
     estimated shipping costs around $1600. I also had not seen the car 
     myself or had a chance to drive it so I felt uncomfortable about 
     including shipping in my purchase deal. I picked a long weekend, 
     Memorial Day, took an overnight flight from Portland, OR to Hartford, 
     CN with my check in hand giving me right of refusal if I was unhappy 
     with the car. The dealer picked me up from the airport the next 
     morning, I checked out the car, made the transaction and was on the 
     road by Thursday noon. I decided to indulge in the joys of my new car 
     and drove home arriving Sunday night. 3091 miles across in 15 states 
     taking advantage of what the car was designed for: DRIVING! 2 days 
     off work and I was still home in time to spend the Memorial Day 
     Monday holiday with my family. Costs were minimal as I used a 
     frequent flyer coupon for the airfare (round trip just in case), 3 
     nights budget hotels $120, $242 in gas, and meals not included as I 
     had to eat anyway.
     
     To answer some expected questions: 
     No tickets/no cops. I used 2 Washington State 3-day Vehicle Trip 
     Permits ($10 each) for registration. I do not drive with a radar 
     detector, but usually speed limit+10mph. Tire Pressure warning light 
     came on in Pennsylvania-added air to Right Rear and then resumed 
     driving (2 weeks later discovered a nail in the tire). Middle of 
     South Dakota hit a pot hole and Air-Bag light malfunction light came 
     on. This stayed with me the rest of the drive. Local dealer is 
     addressing this on warranty.
     
     For the curious:
     Wallingford, CN    start   noon
     Du Bois, Penn.     368 mi  19.7 mpg
     Youngstown, Ohio   sleep   500 mi day total
     
     Lagrange, Indiana  391 mi  20.5 mpg
     Wisc. Dells, Wisc. 334 mi  19.6 mpg
     La Crosse, Wisc.   sleep   682 mi day total
     
     Worthington, Minn. 326 mi  19.9 mpg
     Rapid City, SD     402 mi  20.0 mpg
     Gillette, WY       sleep   782 day total
     
     Billings, Mont.    378 mi  17.7 mpg
     Dear Lodge, Mont.  260 mi  17.6 mpg
     Ritzville, WA      336 mi  18.3 mpg
     Vancouver, WA      296 mi  HOME-midnight
                        1127 mi day total
     
     I actually didn't drive the shortest route for 2 reasons. First is 
     boredom. I have driven I-84 Nebraska/Wyoming/Utah/Idaho/Oregon to 
     Washington many times and I was looking for new country. Second is I 
     wanted the opportunity to drive through Montana where the speed limit 
     is "Reasonable and Prudent". Notice the drop in mpg, but also the 
     increase mi/day. Setting the cruise control at 100mph seems 
     reasonable to me. I did see 135mph on 1 straight section, but rain 
     and traffic (yes, in Montana) kept me from venturing faster.
