> As for a 928 with a Chevy motor in it, WELL, That sounds absolutely obscene!

It's great!

Bob,

I have 2 928s. One is a beautiful, stock 84 S w/ an auto. The other is a 79
5-speed with a Chevy small block in it. As obscene as the hybrid might sound
to you, consider this; it has 450 HP and 500 ft/lbs of torque and I don't
even have a $400 nitrous oxide injection system on it...yet. As it is now, 
it should be able to turn a 4 second 0-60 and _still_ ride like a 928. Who
wouldn't like to have a 928 that moved like that?

I've almost finished the project (just need to hook up the exhaust, finish
the engine wiring and break the motor in). So, how much would it have cost me 
make my 928 motor put out the power/torque that I've gotten out of the Chevy?
Well, Devek has the stroker kit for ~$7500, but that kit won't provide anyone
with a 450HP / 500ft/lb 928 motor. And the "little" things, like popping a
T-belt, get _REALLY_ expensive when they happen to your pumped-up 928 engine!
An entire sbc rebuild takes a week and maybe $1000. Aftermarket performance
goodies are everywhere. And FWIW, I can actually see the ground under the
the hood of the car from almost every side of the engine! My knuckles 
appreciate this.

Don't you ever wish your 928 could spank all those who challenge? Yes...that's
somewhat childish, but I hope to never loose the kid in me. Then again, there's
something childish about owning _any_ type of performance vehicle. Face it, a
car _could_ be nothing more than a vehicle used to get from point A to point B.
Those who have lost their inner child _do_ drive Metros and minivans.

The 84 will always be the sunny day driver and the 79 will be the weekend
warrior. I think every 928 owner should own 8 -- 7 stock and one hybrid.
