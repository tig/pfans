 Man, I got so sick of dealing with the plastic-lined ball-joint at the 
top of the torque tube that I re-engineered the whole thing.  I also had 
problems breaking the small threaded shaft between the ball-joint cup 
itself and the rod.  Both of these problems were due to very hard 
shifting (going into 3rd), mostly on the track, but several times on the 
street.  Eventually the darn thing will pop out due to wear.
 Anyway, my fix was to take a piece of 1.5-2" diamater/3-4" long Teflon 
square stock and machine a hole longitudinally slightly larger than the 
shift link itself. I also machined a shallow curve on one side to mate up 
against the torque tube.  Then I took the ball-joint off, slid the Teflon 
bushing down, then re-attach the ball-joint.
 Now I needed to secure the Teflon bushing, so I took two very long SS 
hose clamps and clamped the heck out of the bushing to the torque tube 
(clamps go around the torque-tube).  To further stabilize the it, I JB 
Welded a couple of "stops" onto the torque tube, on each side of the 
bushing.  I did not bother putting any lube on it, since it was Teflon.  
Now I can shift as hard as I want with no fear of popping the ball-joint 
out, and my shifts are more precise.
