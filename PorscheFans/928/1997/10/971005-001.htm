I need to make a correction to an earlier post regarding 928 Euro parts:

The bad news:

The factory's customer service center does not do mail order business as I
had thought. They only ship parts to customers who come to the factory and
buy parts there, but can't carry the parts home by themselves. :-(

The good news:

I know an extremely Porsche-knowledgable guy (factory trained mechanic, has
racing mechanic experience,...) in good cold Germany, who's father happens to
own a Porsche dealership. This guy has lived in the US for a while, and has
experience with shipping parts overseas. If you have trouble getting Euro
parts I can get you in touch with him, and he'll be happy to help you out.

If you need USED Euro parts, I can also provide some sources.
