so i am whippin thru the e- post separating grain and chaff [ the hoosier
that i am] and lo like a trip to tibet i see all this interest in missions,
purpose and intent. not to be understated or underdone, i felt somewhat
sheepish having set into motion a coagulant for 928 owners a few years ago
and then life issues prevented me from making that jello mold we all would
be proud to plant on our hot aluminum hoods. okay so can i help it that i
was downing cherries outta the bowl of life when i realized the darn things
had pits? not the kind you drive into or the ones that catch dinasaurs mind
you, more like chuckholes really. so well i had great response back when i
put the lst &s out into the universe for all to see. it was great, and of
course mark and kim and bob [ and thru bob, lucky and red] were all very
supportive, as well as several of our local 928'ers who really represented
the core group of terminal 928 psycopaths , like tom schwenk - who had a
holly carb on his at parade when it was in traverse city, or ken geljack
who drives one of the most voracious r and d money pits i have had the
pleasure to drive. as i got to be better known, and people saw the flame
here and there, often  the only two things people had in common was they
knew me and drove 928's -- i wont comment on the intelligence exibited by
either move. so like i said  life caught up with me and i had to slide back
into reality and shelf the lst &sc for a while. no dead, but not exactly a
vibrant expression of international unity and motorhead brotherhood either.
and well as many of you social and professional sharks know,  sharks either
swim or we die.
so then comes the 928 p fans page and the tong's [ not to be confused with
those interesting social clubs by the same moniker ] 4everland and dougs
registry. man then do i feel guilt with the old 00029 sleeping in a barn at
my grandma's waitin for me to finishe the revisions to the flame and get
enough time to do anything other than work and sleep. it you know what. its
just friggen great. and then the amazing mr ed not to be confused with
wilbur's buddy, who is a horse rather than has horses] comes thru with the
frenzy. and a small but vibrant cheer goes up from the crowd. a tear comes
to my eye, and i smell a future for another discontinued porsche. and then
i really get a chuckle thinking about becks 928 powered 914. he shudda put
924 rear durms on it to round it out. ... now why the heck did i start this
email... oh yeah.... so, my only suggestion is to keep the ties to pca
national close, they are a great resource. keep marks connection with poc
solid - particulary if joseph and others are gaining ground, and lets try
to maiximize the effects of this darn computer technology. face it, there
are lots of us, and we are everywhere, but most of us have realjobs and
reality interfering with our automotive lives, and while some want to make
money at this, i dont want to wreck a good avocation by making it a
vocation. heck, i have some new ideas and want to build another car. [
anyone want the widebody flame?] i think we need to have an identity that
is recognizable, and will allow us to be somebody a force to reckon with
etc, but lets keep this light.. i am in favor of an electronic newsletter
and reinforcing the webpage as money well spent. etc etc, see now i am
getting to serious so i have to stop or i will have to charge you all.  and
thats what i think, in case you were wondering and if you werent, well just
hit delete.
