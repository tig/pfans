Just wanted to point out that you can fit four wheels/tires in the
back of a 928, three lying flat on the floor and the fourth on top
of one of the others. I put them in large garbage bags to keep hte
crud from the tires from migrating to the inside of my car. Just a
few minutes at the track to put them on and take them off. Once
you've tried track tires (mine are R1's) you'll be hooked even
worse.

Some of us (e.g. Kurt) just drive to the course on the race tires,
but it is a bit comforting to know that you have a nice set of
tires to drive home on if you eat one up at the track.
