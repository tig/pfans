Gang,

I have had numerous encounters similar to this one with many different
vehicles.  Let me just share something that I saw used here in the
Detroit area in the '60s.  You see, I grew up 2 blocks off of Woodward
Ave, better known as "The Strip".  Here, street racing and cruising the
drive-ins was the claim to fame.  It is 4 lanes on either side of a
beautiful grass boulevard.  During the muscle car era, it was not
uncommon to see/hear 8 cars dropppin' the hammer and smokin' the tires
when the traffic light turned green!

It is easy to picture this from behind and of course, it's obvious what
is going on from behind when you see 4 sets of brake lights come on at
the same time after a typical stop light to stop light drag race.  So
what many a street racer used was a "brake light switch"!  Now, don't
get me wrong, I am not advocated use of such a device, nor will I admit
to ever having cleverly hiding any sort of miniature switch or a
matching panel light to inform the driver that the brake lights are
off!  However, I have come across information (this IS the info age, ya
know!) that tells me that, WITH ULTIMATE AWARENESS, these devices have
saved many a driver a ticket!  From ambushes from behind with instant on
radar from entrance ramps, to the situation talked about here, sounds
like this gizmo can save the day.

Two caveats.  Just in thinking about such a device, one can see the
danger of DWHUA (Driving With Head UP the A--).  It would be stupid to
use such a device and not be totally aware of the position of the
switch.  Not only is that insanly dangerous, but a cop pulling you over
for no brake lights working could be really inconvenient!

The second is that there are more than just brake lights switched my the
brake pedal!  A couple that come to mind are cruise control disable and
Torque Conveter lock out switches.  You don't want to muck this stuff
up!

Again, I am not advocating use of such devices, nor will I admit to ever
using/seeing same.  But I would surmise that some of these may still be
in use after all these decades!  I really hope that if they are in use,
they are used by responsible and highly aware drivers!
