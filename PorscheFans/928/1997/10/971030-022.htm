Where do we begin............
Steve wrote " Does anyone know how large the wheel diameter a 928S4 will
accept with matching tires?  It would be OK if the front wheels had a smaller
dia. than
the rears.  I would like to put 20-inchers on, but there aren't any tires
that have a suffciently low profile in order to maintain the correct overall
diameter.  Regarding width, what will really fit under those fenders without
rubbing?  And what wheel width/offset/backspacing is required in order to get
those tires to fit?  And who makes those wheels, or can make them?  I would
prefer non-custom wheels (less expensive), but I know that custom wheels may
be the only option."""""""

Well Steve, You can use 20" wheels with 30 series tires but you better drive
really slow beacuse of potholes and driveways will damaged it..   It will
look great on the s4 but not while driving it slow.   Your best bet is 17" or
18" on the s4.   The width on front can go 9" with 235 or 245 and back to 10"
with 265 or 275 , must have custom offset to fit. (BBS,
ForgeLine,Ruf,HRE,Fikse,Kinesis..etc..)  It cost from $400-$900 per wheel
with this brands.   For non-coustom wheels shop at  Tire Rack with the new
17"  Turbo Twist Wheel ( 5 star) with 235/40/17 zr in front and 265/40/17 zr
 Continental  in the back deliveried to your place for $1,800 (on my 928).
  It fits perfectly on the s4 with a little grap and will not touch the
fender.  It exposed your BIG RED brake calipers wide open with rooms to clean
the wheel from outside.
This is some options to go, if you have money try custom built wheels that
you like, keep in mind that it will run you $3,000-$5,000 easy (tires no
included). Hope this help. here is my .28 cents.
