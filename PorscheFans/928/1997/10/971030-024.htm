$10k for a used interior installed :-(
Even $3.5 seems high to me ( OK I'll
admit I'm frugal/CHEAP)
I had the front seats and door panels recovered with imitation black
leather
(vinyl) and some seams repaired on the back seat, carpets reglued. It
cost me
$700 parts and labor.  It  is obvious to a
Porscheophile that it is not original BUT
it is ten times better than the ratty original
interior.  I also have a 88 Jaguar XJS
V12 Coupe that I bought from an insurance company. They had totalled the
car (wrote it  off as a total loss) because of a vandalised interior.
Jag leather if anything is more expensive than Porsche.
I shopped around and eventually found a
individual in New Jersey (through Hemmings Motor News/highly
recommended) that was parting out a XJS
and purchased the entire interior including
all wood trim front seats and door panels
for $550  another $600 for installation and
some minor restiching and  the car looks 
fine.
 My advice is shop around, be willing to wait for the right price and be
willing to 
consideer nontraditional alternatives.
In an ideal world every Porsche should be
just like it came from the factory, but realistically would you rather
drive it
or look at it while youi save up for a 
"original part"
Update: my 79 finally passed its Emission test after some adjustment.
The exterior
faded paint buffed out much better than 
I expected. There is some serious paint flaking on the front bumper.
I've found 
a batterycover and spare tire cover, thanks  for all the advice/sources.
Still don't have a complete wiring diagram
for the mirror switch but after I talked 
the wife into adjusting the passenger side mirror, while I sat in the
drivers seat, it is not a big problem :-)
Questions:  Neither the speedometer or the  tachometer are
working........ typical
problem? any thoughts?
There seems to be some front end shutter
when braking.......do 928 rotors warp or
should I look at some other cause.

Thomas
