Yes, although it's not vital. The belly pan runs the full width of the air
dam back several feet, so that you need to remove it to change oil or do
anything else requiring access to the bottom of the engine. It's part of
the comprehensive aerodynamic package Porsche worked up for the S4 to cure
the previous models' high drag.

If you run your car at really high speeds, you'll benefit in reduced drag
and (probably) reduced lift. If you run your car in the real world, you'll
benefit from the fact that this pan is lower than any part of the engine,
and so scrapes first, giving you warning and some measure of protection
(no, off-roaders, it's not a skid plate) for those nice castings and
accessories which otherwise will be the first to give you audible warning
of inadequate clearance.
