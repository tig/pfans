I can attest to the clutch pedal to the floor, syndrome because it happened to 
me three weeks ago on I84 in Waterbury CT
5:30 PM about 5 miles from my mechanic. So I limped over in second gear after a 
few miles the pedal pooped up, so a quick push in to get into neutral at the 
light and a repeat of the process to get back into gear with a little grinding. 
And I made it to the shop.  The brakes worked but not as well as normal. brake 
warning light came on after the clutch went to the floor.  Took three days to 
get the car back local Porsche garage sent the wrong hose the first time and we 
ended up getting it shipped from CA .

Old 928's never die we just make them go faster.
  An 84 928 S stick black/black and slightly enhanced.
