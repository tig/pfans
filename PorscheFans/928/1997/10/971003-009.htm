I had a similar incident happen to me late one evening in the parking
lot of a restaurant.  I pressed the pedal of my 944 down to start the
car and  "clunk", the pedal hits the floorboard and stays there. 
Obviously, I was not going to get it fixed there, so I drove the 30
miles home that night.  The first half of the drive was in the city with
lots of traffic lights, luckily the last half was mostly freeway.  As
most of you know, you don't need the clutch to shift once you are
rolling.  The fun was at the red lights!  Had to pull the gearshift into
neutral and turn the engine off.  Then, slide it into first and hit the
starter when the light turned green.  Good battery and starter were a
help!  Don't try this at home!  (just kidding!)  In a pinch, this
technique which has been around forever, saved me a lot of money in
towing charges and time!  I apologized to my baby for one or two
non-perfect gear changes when we were safe and sound in the garage!
