Steve,
The discussion is about aluminum verses steel lower ball joints, not control
arms.
The cost is really not a big deal $75-$90 each depending on where you get them
(PAP,Vertex, GPR, etc)
You will have to have the front alignment done after installation, other than
that no biggie.
There are steel lower control arms available aftermarket for 944s , but to my
knowledge that are none for 928s.
As far as I know there is not a steel upper arm available anywhere.

There is a replaceable rubber boot for the upper ball joint on the 928, if
memory serves me correct it is an Audi part for the 85-86 5000 Turbo upper ball
joint. Available at you local Audi dealer.
Caution: In my opinion this should only be used if you split a boot while doing
front suspension work. If you have boots that have been split for a while and
dirt has gotten in the joint it will only be a matter of time before it fails
even if you put new boots on the joint.
