Floyd,
I have used the standard BarreCrafters roof mount very successfully in the past.
It has the soft rubber pads that sit on the roof  and then has the gutter type
clips that go under the door frame lip.
Used it many times on my ex-84 for ski trips in the past with no damage. Haven't
used it on my later cars because of a handy CJ7 sitting in the driveway.
I have seen many ski racks advertised for the early 928s which are a rear hatch
type rack , but I have never seen one for the later S4s because of the rear
wing.

Another suggestion is the new generation Magnetic Ski Racks, everyone that I
know that has them thinks they are great. They have been speed tested to 100mph
plus ;o)
