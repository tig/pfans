> The 1987 and 88 944S and 89-91 944S2 (also 928S4) all use the same
camshaft
> chain tensioner/head mounting configuration.  There has been a very high
> failure rate of the chain tensioner.  The mileage range I have discovered
> is 50,000 to 90,000 miles, with some failures as early as 35,000 miles. 
> The plastic rubbing blocks that the chain spins against become worn
thinner
> and become brittle with age and a piece of the plastic eventually breaks
> off and can jam in between the cam chain and cam chain sproket.  This
> breaks the chain, bends valves, strips the cambelt, and in many cases,
> breaks the chain tensioner mounting block right off the head, meaning you
> need a new head ( the broken off piece could not be heli-arced back in
> place since the piece deformed before breaking and did not fit right). 
On
> a 944S this is a $7,000 repair using a Porsche re-manufactured head (a
> $1,000 core charge is included - no core to turn in since it is broken). 
> This problem is so prevalent, striking unknowing owners, that Porsche
> salvage yard dealers tell me they get 2 or 3 calls per day from owners
with
> heads broken at the cam chain tensioner mount. 
> 
> What makes this failure different in my opinion, is that the chain
> tensioner does not have a Porsche recommended inspection and/or
replacement
> mileage or age interval in the maintenance manual.  What really creates
the
> air of negligence in my opinion, is that that problem has been occuring
and
> known for 9 years yet Porsche never notified car owners or dealers to
> inspect/replace the chain tensioner.  Porsche did change the cam belt
> maintenance interval and even sent a new page to car owners which glued
> into your maintenance manual over the origional page.  Why did they not
act
> when the cam chain tensioner can cause even more engine damage than a
> broken cam belt?  I believe this is negligent.
> 
> If you have suffered this failure, agree that Porsche may be negligent in

> address, phone number, car year and model, and cost you incurred due to
> this failure.

> If you disgree with any of the above, also send me your opinion or
