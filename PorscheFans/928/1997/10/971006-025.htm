For those of you who own 928's with auto trans experiencing the warm
console symptoms:

There is an easy fix for about $5!  There is a piece of custom
fabricated foam between the torque tube and the shifter, it doesn't fit
the best, and it deteriated over time because of the affect of heat on
foam materials (it shrinks)  I went to Home Depot, and bought a can of
expanding insulator foam in a can, it came with a  clear plastic tube
for aiming.   I also bought about a foot of clear  flexable tubing large
enough that the plastic tube that came with the foam would fit inside
it.  I cut the plastic tube in half and inserted both pieces in each end
of the flexable tubing.  I then removed the shift handle and the cover
around the shifter.  Following the instructions on the can I filled all
of the cracks I could see in the foam visible by placing two drop lights
on the floor under the car on each side under the seats.. I covered the
shift cable with duct tape. (Remove when dry)  Be very careful not to
get any of this foam on your interior.  Cover everything, and I mean
everything!  ( I used newspaper) When you let up on the trigger the foam
keeps coming out.  It is in a small tube and the foam expands forcing it
out of the tube.  Reinstall the shift handle with out the cover, and let
set over night....  test the next day and repeat until no hot air leaks
through.


I can't believe how many people emailed me and wanted to trade with my
friend for the M3!  Most of them requested for me not to 
reveal their identities here......To be honest with the resale value the
M3 has he should be looking at a 91 GT or better........
