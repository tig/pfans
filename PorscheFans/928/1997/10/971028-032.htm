Hello, I noticed your question yesterday and I believe you saw World
Upholstery and Trim's ad.  They are very good but just the front and
rear seat covers are about $2000. Don't know if that includes
installation.  I have spoken to someone in Virginia that had just about
every inch of his 928 interior done for about $3000.  He mailed it to
them and the removal, shipping and reinstallation was another $1000. 
I've seen photos and it looks first rate. The material is (very leather
like) marine grade vinyl which is obviously much more durable than the
original thin leather.  The only downside was that it took them 8
months!  I'll find the shop's name and # and post.

A shop near me in Atlanta quoted me $10,000 for the same job, only
difference being removal/reinstallation included.  Just because it's a
928 doesn't mean you ought to get killed!  

928 interiors are difficult to work with, especially the deep folds in
the seats.  If anyone else knows about these matters please post, seems
most older ones need it!
