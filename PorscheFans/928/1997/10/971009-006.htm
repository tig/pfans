>I am a brand new neurotic owner of a white '88 s4

Congratulations!

>thanks to the help of Brian Buxton who has been diligent, honest, and
>extremely helpful. 

I'm glad to hear it; I've been referring people to him for a while, but
yours is the first clear feedback.

>What kind of gas are you all using?

The well-advised of us are using the highest octane gas we can get
(practically the 93 octane most stations sell or the 94 available from
Sunoco).

>does it matter whether it's Chevron, ARCO, or Shell?  My
>mechanic told me to only use Chevron on my wife's 750il

It probably doesn't matter, but Chevron has built a reputation for
effective cleaning of fuel injectors, particularly through their Techron
additive, which you can buy separately from any of the mail order parts
houses.

>The BMW group suggest using regular instead of premium in moderate
>climates because it burns better in the 12-cylinder engine.

Let them eat low-octane cake. I doubt that they're right even for their own
cars, but they're definitely wrong for yours and mine.

>My 928 owners manual says only use premium.

It speaks the truth. Your car's engine control computers will adapt to
whatever fuel you put in by retarding the spark to avoid knock. However,
though they can preserve smooth running, they cannot preserve power under
these conditions. Once again: use the highest octane gas you can get.

>My "new" car has 77k,  new waterpump,timing belt, cap &
>rotors, all new fluids, and absolutley screams down the road.

Neat, eh?

>Are there any major engine precautions I should be aware of?

Just one; make sure the main timing belt is retensioned every 15,000 miles
or so and replaced every 45,000 to 60,000 miles. If the BELT TEN warning
light comes one, stop the engine NOW. If it does not come on when you
restart, just keep an eye out for it. Otherwise, flatbed the car to the
shop. A broken or significantly slipped belt can result in valves hitting
pistons. When you replace the timing belt, you may want to replace the
water pump as a proactive measure.

>I read something about aluminum ball joints in a previous thread but
>do not know if it applies to an '88 s4.

No; that was resolved years before.

>I am also looking for the protective pans that fit under the engine from the
>front spoiler to the cat but cannot get any good pricing on used parts.

Where have you shopped? Have you tried 928 International
(http://www.928intl.com/index.htm)? Join PCA
(http://www.porschefans.com/PCA/PCA_Info.html), get Panorama magazine, and
look for the ads from the parts recyclers (e.g., Kempton, Parts Heaven).

>Is it ok to drive without them?

Yes, and a lot of people do, but you'll gain both better high-speed
aerodynamics and some protection for the underside of the engine (the belly
pan scrapes first and you hear it).

>it is good to know we have Leonard Laub, Phil Tong, etc.. to gain wisdom.

Shucks!
