Re: Kelly and his quest for $4-6K 928, I found my nice, straight ,
strong,  smogged 79 5spd , 135K on the clock, on it's 3rd owner, records
lacking, new alternator, tinted rear windows, appeared well maintained
until this PO, who was financially challenged,
petrolblau/camel, interior very good with one bowed spot in dash above
console, (livable or coverable) , respray fading on hood and roof (but
OK from 10 feet), NEW Dunlops, ran rough at idle, the usual worn syncros
1st & 2nd, LF and RR turn signals inop, interior lights inop, crappy
stereo, RH power window inop, here in SFO Bay area on the internet
classifieds. Asked $5100-gave $4600. A little wire, contact cleaner,
some advice from this FINE list, a spare Blaupunkt from the closet (long
story), an 'S' rear spoiler from PartsHeaven  (just because), a trip to
DEVEK (thanks Marc and Susan), and I am into the car for $6K INCLUDING
taxes and registration. It's not a GT or S4, but it certainly lives up
to it's  "1978 Car of the Year" status, and is a troublefree daily
driver, and when the timing belt lets go  I'll be buying, not crying. No
offense, but how many of those valves can you use at 65mph? So I say ,go
on with your search, compared to Alfa's, you are nearing the promised
land...
