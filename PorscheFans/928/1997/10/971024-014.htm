first posting to this group........HELP
I recently acquired a 79 928 the previous 
owner disconnected  the switch that adjusts both remote outside mirrors.
anyone out there with a wiring diagram 
and/or an explaination of what wire goes
on what post?

Second ?  There is nothing between the top of the battery  and the
carpet. Is there
a cover over the battery and another on top of the spare tire?  If so
where might I get one or both?

This is my first 928, I have had a 914 and 
a couple of 924's, so this  could be considered my first Porsche if
you're a 
purist who consider 914's and 924's as Volkswagens/Audi's with Porsche
badges.

 The car and I are in Colorado. i purchased  the car as a parts/race
car, because the seller did not have a title.
The interior was total trash (redone now
non factory) mechanics seem fine. Needs a repaint (faded red with LOTS
of scratches, gouges and dings)   I've got 
the title/paper work problem sorted out
so I'll be street legal as soon as I get an
Emission test.   Thanks for any assistance.


Regards
Thomas
