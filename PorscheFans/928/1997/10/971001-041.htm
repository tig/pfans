If in California, that's a guaranteed fail of the visual portion of a smog
check or CHP roadside inspection.  Just having a loud car is enough of an
excuse for the officer to pull that exhaust check.  You are right that probably
no one will notice.  But if every joe-blow ran bypasses we'd all be stuck with
poorer quality air (but maybe better tans?).  I empathize with your situation
and used to run a bypass too on various cars.  Now I think I'll leave the cats
on for street duty and order one of those secondary muffler bypass pipes
instead.  Save the bypass for the track...  at least here in crowded, sometimes
smoggy SF, CA.

Jeez, are these walls getting closer?
