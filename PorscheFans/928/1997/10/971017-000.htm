And what a watershed day it was:

1.  Got that infernal cup on finally.

I'd like to offer this to the FAQ:

a.  The reason why the repair manuals show this procedure as a tube
already off procedure is because that's the only way to guarantee proper
alignment of the cup, let alone trying to reach it to begin with.  Not
deterred yet?  Read the FAQ instructions above first.   Per the FAQ, you
must undo the shifter so the rod can hang free.  Don't waste your time
with crowsfoot wrenches, u-joints, flex extensions, etc. on the nut as
there is no clearance / leverage!  You can however leave the cats in
place by letting them hang down (do remove the O2 sensor though- I let
that hang too).

b.  Big Tip #1:  Get a pair of long-nose channel locks.  This is for
squeezing the spring plates on the shifter assembly together.  Once
clamped, you can easily remove the top set of clips/washer/bushing with
snap ring pliers.  Remove only the top the rod since that's the one with
the cup at the other end.  Photos to follow.

c.  Get back under the car and tilt the rod to either side of the tube.
I went to the passenger side.  The shift rod is pinched / idented so you
can slip a 16mm open end onto it to hold it still.  Thanks engineers for
small wonders.  Now you can remove the 17mm lock nut easily.

d.  Once installed and aligned as best you can you're wondering how to
get the new, tight-fitting cup back on the ball.  Now you know why it's
a tube off, that cup should be struck with a mallet it's so tight
fitting.

Phil's Big Tip #2:  Use a bunch of water hose clamps connected in series
to wrap around the rod & tube, then simply crank it down / smaller in
diameter until the cup snaps into place.  Voila, you are home free.

e.  To prevent the rod from ever coming loose again, I left the hose
clamp arrangement in place, slightly snug.  There might be accelerated
cup wear but the car shifts great and I'd rather wear out the cup and
have it stay in place than not.  YMMV but not if the car can't get in
gear.

f.  This turned out to be a bigger job than I thought but I was trying
to reduce steps or at least come up with a novel way to save you some
trouble.  Work slowly and carefully and you will be successful with a
minimum of swear words emminating from your garage..

Yeeha, the GT's back on the road!
Phil
