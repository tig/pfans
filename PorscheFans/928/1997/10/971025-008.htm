Guys, and Gals,

I need your collective eyes and ears, ok mostly eyes.  I am looking for my
dream car and only you can help.  I have already been in touch with some of
you and have had your help for several months and now it is time to ask for
the collective help of the list.  I appreciate anything any of you can
do...here are the specifics:

'93-'95 GTS (prefer '94 or '95)
Must be Automatic
Must be one of two colors (Maritime Blue preferred or Riviera Blue)
Any color interior and any options

If you see a car that matches these specifications let me know ASAP!

If you are not familiar with those colors they are on either side of the
medium blue Mazda Miata.  Also just so you will all know Paul H has seen one
up in the NY area and Jorg has located a 5 spd (damn it) in Germany.  The one
Paul located is Riviera Blue and the one Jorg has located is Maritime Blue
(also a Euro '92!).

If YOU can help I would appreciate it.

TIA,
James Morrison
