Hi Dave,

The "official" name of the option  is called "Rootwood Console". It was a
$4623 option in 1990. There's actually 3 pieces to the option. The center
piece starts right below the radio and continues down and rearward.  It
contains the air conditioning controls and clock (which is a circular VDO
style and not the normal rectangular analog style). It also contains the ash
tray door and continues aft, surrounding the gearshift lever and stops in
front of the window/sunroof/rear wiper switch console. The 2 other pieces are
on the door and are mirrors images of each other. They start above the
armrest at the pull handles. They're about 4 inches wide, start at the door
handles and go aft to the rear of the arm rests.
Well this is probably more than you wanted to know. I do have the window
stcker for the car. The originial owner said he ordered the car and checked
off everything he could from the order list. The car is Linen Grey Metallic
(Smoke Silver) with a 2 tone Burgundy/Linen (Ivroy) interior. The dash,
doors, headliner, etc. are burgundy and the seats and carpet are Linen.
I hope I didn't bore you too much.

Thanks,

John Weber
