Hi Leonard

Actually its OK to have both. Most cars do in fact. All the ones, except 
the 928, I've owned at least. Canada changed over to Kilometers around 76 
or 77 I think and most speedo's have been marked with KPH and MPH ever 
since. Makes a lot of sense with the US being so close and so many of us 
enjoying the opportunity to visit. I suspect that KPH is probably 
required to be the most prominent however. Actually, in the years leading 
up to the change over, most speedo's had KPH as a secondary display. I'm 
not sure I recollect ever seeing a Porsche speedo with both.
