Hi Everyone,

It's been a while since this subject was discussed.  I'm reasonably sure
there are new owners who have joined this unique group of car owners and
haven't heard about this problem.  So, I thought it was about time to
re-visit the subject of old 928's with aluminum ball joints.

If you have a newer 928, this doesn't affect you.  However, if you have an old
928, say a 1978 or 79, you may have a time bomb waiting to bite you.

Make sure that you inspect those ball joints and if they're aluminum,
replace them immediately.  I was very lucky when mine failed a year ago
this past July.  I was backing out of a parking space when the lower left
ball joint let go.  I had just driven 140 miles up I-5 from Vancouver, WA
to Tacoma, WA at speeds ranging from 60-90.  Had this happened at 90, you'd
have read about it in the newspaper.  Fortunately, I had AAA+ so the 140
mile tow bill wasn't too exorbitant.

Most of the older cars have been retrofitted with the newer style steel
ball joints but I'm reasonably sure that there are still some examples of
the old style units  out there.  If you find that you have aluminum ball
joints I wouldn't trust them to move the car across the street.  REPLACE
THEM IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!

Good driving to you all,
Bob East
