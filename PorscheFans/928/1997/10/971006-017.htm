Did you say you didn't know the difference between a hostname and an email
address?

porschephiles@tta.com was a mailing list, not a web site, or anything like
that. It was handled by the mail server at tta.com. No porschephiles
domain/host name required.

Forget nslookup, you should have just send an email to
porschephiles@tta.com and seen what came back in the bounce.
