Hey that's a really good price for tires, installed too!!   I'm in S. Cal
as are a number of other 928's I see on the road.  Would you mind telling
us where you got the tires?  I'm currently running on the last parts of
Dunlop D60 A2 tires, so I'm beginning to look for replacements.  I use the
car for my daily driver and long trips, no competition.

Also would appreciate knowing the source for the windshield.  Mine is
speckled and hard to see thru in the sunlight.

Thanks for any info you can send.
