I have the complete set of MB Quart Seperates in my 90 S4.  This
includes:

(2) 1" Tweeters
(2) 4" Midranges
(2) 6" Woofers
(2) Crossovers

The problem with using these speakers with the factory crossovers, is
that
they don't sound very good!  If you use the MB Quart crossovers, then
you 
only get to use one right channel and one left channel of the factory
amplifier,
which doesn't have enough power to drive the speakers.  I have the top
of the 
line and they complete set with the high end crossovers ran about $600.
Since these speakers aren't cheap, I would find something a little more
suited 
to do the job.  These speakers are designed for 50 watts per channel
minimum.
I'm pushing 70 watts per channel, and they can handle and sound much
better 
with twice the power!  More power doesn't always mean louder.  More
power allows 
more detail of the music to be reproduced, resulting in a superior
sound.  Don't get 
me wrong, they are awesome speakers, but they are designed for people
who are 
serious about their music.  Everybody who has ever been in my car has
been awed
by the quality of sound, and this is due to the MB Quarts.The factory
stereo in these 
cars just doesn't deliver the signal these speakers are designed to
reproduce. You 
can actually damage these high end speakers with an underpowered or
unclean (Distorted)
signal.

Subject: Replacement Speakers- Ideas?

Another poster mentioned an obsolete MB-Quark speaker set.  My '89 has
dried-out cones and surrounds, and needs some help.  I'd like to
maintain
the stock appearance throughout if possible.  Any recommendations on
replacements?
