Actually, you will have a much harder time finding a RUSTY 928 <G>.  The
928 was Porsche's premium auto design, and made extensive use of
galvanized sheet metal, newest undercoating technology and many aluminum
parts, such as hood, front fenders, doors and much of the suspension not
to mention engine and trans case.  I've never heard of rust mentioned as
a problem on any 928.  Nor do they seem to have major engine, trans,
driveline weeknesses.  If you read the list for a time, you will see
most problems revolve around accessories, wiring, etc.  The 928 is not a
simple car.  All those creature-features and power stuff wear out
eventually.  But major driveline components seem very hardy.  A fellow
in my office building has two 928s.  His older 1979 has 250,000+ miles.
Body is solid and rust-free, engine doesn't smoke, trans doesn't whine,
but paint is almost worn off and interior is serious trash.  BUT, the
car has received regular maintenance by a shop that understands 928s.

No problem except older 928s in this price range may have been through
several owners and lost history.  Even at $4-6k I would be a little
fussy and look at a lot of examples before buying. The market is very
soft for 928s and this car is not easy to sell. (Just ask Phil Tong).
Buy the best car you can find for the money in terms of condition.  Hold
out for NO rust, and some evidence that the owner just didn't run it
into the ground before selling.  Remember that many people sell a car
because something expensive just happened that they don't want to pay to
fix.  Buying a 16-valve 928 from someone who wants to "trade up" to a
32-valver might be a good idea.  Check with Brian here on the list.
Maybe he has a candidate car for you.

That would have to be a mighty special car.  Good 928s are not really
that rare.  I saw an absolutely pristine 1979 black 5-speed last week.
Under 60k miles and perfect origional paint, origional owner, always
garaged, etc. Although the car wasn't for sale, I would evaluate the
value at $5-6,000 - maybe.

If you seek, ye shall find...
