....now my new '88s4
....Thanks again Brian Buxton for negotiating the deal with the PO for
me.  For those of you that are
looking..,  do yourself a favor and give Brian a call or an Email.. you
can frequently see his posts, (and his passion for these cars) on this
list or you can get his info off of Phil's website.  Hey Phil,  can't
wait to meet you.   Alex

Glad to see another S4 has found it's way home!  Though there are a few
being resold now, I think the smart money is now holding onto them.
Imagine, once this round of sales are completed this year what's left
for next year?  And glad to of hear such a good experience from no less
than one of our own Brian Buxton.

Anyways, congrats on the new car!  Next sat. is the PCA AX in Dublin so
hopefully see you there...

928's Forever!
Phil
