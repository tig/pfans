at my brake calipers and did not see "Porsche" in raised letters on the
calipers.  I was under the impression this existed on all models from 1972
on.  Does anyone know if this is true?  I might have after market calipers.

Prior to '86.5 928's were equipped with a single piston caliper at all 4
corners.  The 4 piston caliper was used on '86.5 and later cars.  The
single piston caliper is considerably smaller than the 4 piston caliper,
and does not have the PORSCHE lettering on it like the 4 piston does (it is
not painted either).  I wouldn't think you have after-market calipers.
