I've been gone for over a week - finally did the family thing to Disney
World down in Orlando.   GEESH!   Perot's 'sucking sound' (pardon me,
non-US subscribers) was my wallet!  For those that have been there,
EPCOT stands for Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow.   I now
think it means Every Pocket Comes Out Thinner........or maybe Each
Parent Carries One Toddler.   We had a great time, and it was worth the
money.

While leaving Universal studios, I checked out a red 79 (?) in the
parking lot.   It had buckskin leather and appeared to be a daily
driver.   On the ride back to the hotel about 20 minutes later, another
RED 'S' passed us by.   I'd guess it was an 82 or 83.  It was nice to
see a couple of 928s out and about.

Now - for an interesting repair.   Upon handling the back glass after
removal from the hatch, I inadvertantly broke off one of the connectors
soldered onto the glass for the rear window defrost.  I've had similar
troubles in the past and never found a good fix - until now.   While on
a parts run to Radio Shack, I discovered an item they call 'Solder
Tape.'   It is very thin strips of solder about 1/4" by 1/2"........with
a melting point low enough that matches will melt it.   I took two
pieces and placed on the pads of the connector, positioned the connector
on the glass and held it with a flat blade screwdriver, and heated the
tape with a blower.   It is not a hair blower, but one used for paint
removal and heavy-duty hot air applications.   Anyhow, the solder melted
and voila!   It checked out with a volt meter for electrical integrity
and holds mechanically as orginally designed.

Maybe this is old news to most of you, but I've never seen anything
about repair of bonded solder joints on glass.   This technique will
work for a broken connector pin on the back of the side mirror (for
heated mirrors).

Sorry for the long post, but wanted to share this info.
