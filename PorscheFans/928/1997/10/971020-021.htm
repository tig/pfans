   The brake pedal on my '83 is soft, and I'm a bit baffled about why.
   The pedal had felt soft years ago, shortly after I bought the
   car, but replacing the master cylinder fixed the problem.  The pedal
   had begun to feel soft again recently, so last week I replaced the master
   cylinder with a new unit and thoroughly bled the system.  The pedal
   still feels soft.
   
   My mechanic suspects that the vacuum booster might be bad even though
   it will hold vacuum during testing.  I have braided steel lines to
   the calipers, so I know there is no expansion in the flex lines, and
   there aren't any signs of a leak in the system.
   
   Has anyone had to replace a vacuum booster to cure a soft pedal?  How
   did you know the booster was bad?
