Hi Damon:


As you have already learned,  928s have a warning light that indicates that
the pressure on the brake system is low. This warning light is different
than the
warning that indicates, for example, used brake pads. In the brake pads
case the
warning light will illuminate continuously  when you turn the car on and can be
turned off by pushing  a button  in the center console (button with exclamation
mark).  The low brake pressure warning is a flashing light that will not go
off when
 you push the above mentioned button.  I imagine that Porsche did this so
we don't
ignore a very serious problem.  The brake pressure warning lit on my car
after I
washed the chassis and engine.  Luckily it was a wet sensor, but I got
pretty scared.
To reset this warning I dried the sensor and disconnected the battery and the
 problem up to now has been solved.

You may try to disconnect the battery and the light should reset.
I ignore what caused your problem but could be, as you said, a
faulty sensor.


Good Luck,
