On Tuesday sdwmdw@aol.com posted a note about a factory burl wood dash
option called the Rootwood console. I am completing the restoration of a
1980 928 cabriolet conversion and wonder if anyone knows where I could
get a used Rootwood Console. I think the original sticker was something
like $4300, which is ridiculous but maybe finding one from 928
International or a parted out car might be a possible. By the way,
Porsche fans may be interested in the Euro conversion that Lucky Eckman
at the east coast Devek shop just completed for me on the stock 928 2
valve engine. It was converted to a modified Euro-S format. The
conversion ran 4 weeks and included headers, new Euro heads, Devek cams,
new stainless 3' pipes custom fabricated, Extruded hone induction and a
range of upgrades to an S4 colling system. Lucky did the work personally
and is a class guy and did a heck of a job. The conversion was not cheap
but the dyno confirmed a significant uptick in torque and BHP. I'll be
running the car at Texas World Speedway in November to see how the
conversion paid off where it counts- on the track.

Regards to fellow Austin Sharks.
