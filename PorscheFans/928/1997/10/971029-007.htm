Philip,
I have to agree with Michael, especially since you have a later style trans
instead of the earlier type (which can be very clunky from 1st to 2nd almost
always). If you put a good synthetic 75-90 gear lube (Mobil 1, Redline, etc.) in
your transaxle it will definitely help with the problems on those cold
mornings.Although it will still be a little "stiff" for the first few minutes,
it should be drivable. Just take it easy with it for a few miles.

I use Redline 80-140 syn. Race lube in my 79 which has the 89GT LSD 5-speed, the
last few mornings here in Atlanta have been in the low 30s and it is very
"stiff" for the first few minutes but then becomes slick as glass. To look at
the positive side of the situation it gives my engine oil a little time to warm
up before I start pushing it hard.
