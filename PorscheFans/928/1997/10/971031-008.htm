IMHO, it doesn't matter one whit whether the constabulary sees brake
lights coming on or not.   If you are gonna get busted, by the time you
figger it out and hit the brakes, the law already decided to swing
around  to pull you over, to let you go, or whatever action they deem
suitable.   On a technicality of law, brake light activation is no proof
of speeding and the law cannot use it in court.

Just one quickee on Indiana's finest from this past spring:    I was
testing a newly assembled engine on the back roads - well known to me,
long straight two-laner, rarely any traffic.   I was cruising about 75
in a 55..........of course, from other direction, the LAW!   I instantly
knew I was toast, so let off the pedal and waited for 'the
signal'......       He flashed his lights and as he passed by in
opposite direction, waggled his index finger at me over his steering
wheel.   I knodded my head in acknowledgement and slowed down to
55............for at least 200 yards or so.........and quietly smiled
approval as I eased back down on the throttle while checking guages and
listening to the engine as a final road test.
