  My experience has been that no amount of balancing (whether accurate or
  not) can get rid of the shaking that tends to occur when the compound
  on a high performance street tire starts to get hard.  On many high perf 
  street tires, the compound is softest at the outside of the tread and 
  tends to be harder toward the inside (i.e. closer to the wear bars).  
  Between the harder compound that is exposed as the tire wears and the 
  natural process of the rubber getting harder as the tire ages, performance 
  degradation is inevitable.  More than once I've had to replace tires that 
  still had a decent amount of tread just because the hardened compound was 
  causing shaking and unacceptable levels of grip.  I've had this problem with
  Bridgestone RE-71s, Bridgestone Potenzas, Yoko A-008, and Yoko AVSi.  I did 
  not experience the problem with Yoko A-008Rs (a soft compound autocross tire).
  
  Supposedly, the Dunlop SP-8000 has a new type of compound which is 
  designed to provide a consistent level of hardness throughout the entire 
  life of the tread.  I put a set of these on my wife's car, so I'll
  see how my experience matches Dunlop's claims.  I believe that the SP-8000
  has been superceded by the SP-9000, but I would expect the same compound
  characteristic.  BTW, after driving on them for a few months, I do not 
  consider the SP-8000 to be a great ultra-high perf tire.  They're fine for
  the type of driving my wife does and they offer excellent wet weather 
  traction, but they're definitely not 928 material.
