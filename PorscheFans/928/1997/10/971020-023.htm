I'm interested in used 5 spoke wheels.  I like the Carerra 2 turbo style
(especially three piece riveted), the ones that came on the very last
928's that also come on the current 911 (aftermarket OK), OZ Mito
Modulars, the various late 80's/early 90's aftermarket C2 mentioned
above, and I've seen some pretty cool DP Motorsports ones (like in the
ad they have in Excellence on the black 911 with red head girl in car,
legs out of car)

 I have noticed that 16" ones that came on late 80's/early 90's 911's
have a thinner spoke than the 17" and it seems like 928's have the fat
ones.  I vastly prefer the thin style!  This is often called the C2
wheel.  The point is that I guess I'd be restricted to aftermarket
copies that were popular back then.

Please call with what you've got at 770-522-4722 or Email
eric.hoffman@hboc.com.  Thanks and love the page!
