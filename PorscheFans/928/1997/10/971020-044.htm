I'm sure this was a defensive move to keep the list from fragging -
we've always been admonished to run digest mode as it's less strain on
the "listserver".  Though it makes responding to individual posts more
of a PITA, I voluntarily made a change to digest mode a week or so ago,
as well as tried to clear out my duplicate ID's (you all have just one
right?).

Noted also were some that volunteered to take over hosting the lists to
provide a more stable environment so let's see what happens.  I might
add a BB feature to 928's Forever too as a backup environment /
alternate net-fix for those of us that just can't get enough of 928
talk!
