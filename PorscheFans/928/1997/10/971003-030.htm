Wes,
You asked about two option code stickers on a 1990 928S4 which you found
under the rear deck carpet. I also have a 1990 'S4 which also had two option
stickers under the carpet. I took one and placed it in the appropriate place
in the car's maintenance book on page 4.
My option code doesn't list the 220 option code either. The Porsche Limited
Slip Differential (PSD) was standard on MY 1990 and up both S4's and GT's.
As far as price, depending upon condition (which miles is only ONE
indicator), I'd guess a good price would be in the low $20k's. I bought mine
a year ago out of Los Angeles for $24.5k. It had 70k miles, excellent shape,
records, window sticker, etc. and had about $13k in factory options including
the wood dash option.
I haven't been looking since I bought the car, but I do check the local paper
(San Francisico Chronicle) just to see what they're going for. So my guess
might be stale, but I'm sure someone else can add to it.

Good Luck,

John Weber
