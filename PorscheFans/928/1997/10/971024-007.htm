I just saw this post in the digest and was wondering if any one in the
Boston area has had any experience with Mike McCadden at Bill Stephens
Automotive in Medford?

The previous owner of my Beast (interesting that that seems to be the
name many of us apply to our 928(s) - and I thought I'd thought of it
myself :) ) took it to Mike for routine service during the last year.
He was pleased with Mike's service and ability.  Any Info?
