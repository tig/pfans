To All:
    I can't keep silent in the face of all this fussing about slowing
w/o brake lights coming on.  Have you tried using the emergency brake?
Try it! You'll see no brake lights.  This is where the Valentine1 shines
'cause you only need to do that if the bogie is behind. Another trick
that seems to work if the threat is in front is instantly jam on the
brakes.  I have avoided several stops with that maneuver and I can only
guess that the rapid deaccelleration throws off  the radar reading
sufficiently to raise some doubt in the officer's mind.  They don't seem
to notice that I'm in a panic stop mode.  I guess they're focused on the
screen.  Another ploy( that I wish I'd done) is when driving on a
winding  two lane road with almost no traffic at night and you come upon
a cop coming the other way around a curve and he paints you, ...
continue in the same direction until out of sight and then hang a U turn
and proceed in the cops direction until he goes roaring past.  Play it
by ear from there.
