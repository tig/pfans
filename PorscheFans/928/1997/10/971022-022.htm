     Hello again fellow "Land Shark" tamers:
     
     I read "Alan's" message on the high cost to maintain a 928 and thought 
     that I must be a very lucky owner. If his cost analysis is the norm 
     then I must be at the extreme low end of the expense range.
     
     I have owned my 86 928S for nearly eight years, and the cost per year 
     has been about $3000. That amount includes: gas, insurance, tires, 
     "Mobil 1" and OEM filters, wires (Beru), plugs (NGK Platinum's), caps 
     and rotors (Bosch), an Interstate battery (every five years), hoses, 
     distilled water and coolant, belts (including the replacement of the 
     timing belt and water pump every 45K miles), transmission and 
     differential service (every 30K miles), brakes pads and rotors (about 
     every 60K miles), a new fan clutch (every 12 years), an upper control 
     arm, new springs (Weltmiester), AutoThority Chips, and an extra set of 
     track (993 Cup) Wheels with R1's.
     
     Not every year has been $3000. Some years it's about $1500. This year 
     it's more than $5000 since I had the timing belt & water pump done, and

     also got the track wheels/tires. BTW, my car is well maintained and it
shows.
				 It's even won a Concours d'Elegance or two.
     
     If you haven't figured out my point by now, let me make it clear. Take 
     your time to find a good, clean, well maintained 928. It will likely 
     cost you a "reasonable" (assuming my assessment is reasonable) amount 
     to keep it in good shape. If $3000 per year for all associated costs 
     seems like too much, consider that the average car (a 1990 Taurus for 
     example) will probably cost about $2000 per year (including everything 
     listed) to keep it on the road. So, is it worth paying an extra $1000
to 
     drive a 928? For me, that's a NO BRAINER. If you think not, my advice 
     is; Stay to the right.
     
     Happy motoring. Ed :)
