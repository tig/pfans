My immediate problem is the "belt tension" warning. The
light comes on shortly after cranking the car, despite the fact that the
belt is new and tight. The books barely mention the sensor. How does it
work? The maintenance records show a bad belt tension sensor in about
'88, and I think that the problem may be recurring. Any tips?

My '85 belt light came on all the time when I first bought the car
(including the drive home).  The belt was tensioned about 4 times by the
dealer (in a week) until they finally agreed that something else was wrong.
Eventually they told me that the connector between the belt sensor and the
wiring was vibrating just enough to set off the sensor.  I'm not sure what
the fix was; they probably just secured it better.
