<excerpt>Greetings:


I have  been reading the PorscheFans 928 messages  for several months now
in preparation for  a purchase, and have just left a deposit  on a 1988
S4 with 60k miles in beautiful  shape. (I have been a die-hard fan of the
 928 since 1977 -- at age 17 -- but until  now, other priorities have
conspired to  prevent a purchase.) The dealer, Cherry Hill  Imports here
in NJ, is doing the 60k service  and fixing a few minor cosmetics as part
 of the deal ($20k), and also plans to replace  the shocks.

<paraindent><param>left</param>$20k with that many mile?  Might be a tad
high on price.

Having driven 3 different  928s before settling on this one, I noticed 
that the ride is noticably harder in the  one I'm buying than it is in
the other 2.  Preferring a ride that is not quite so hard,  I'm wondering
if anyone knows what might  cause the difference. Was there a competition
 suspension offered in '88? Can softer shocks  be installed on such a
suspension? Anything  known on this subject would be greatly
appreciated.


My  second question relates to Leonard's car.  I remember that several
months ago ne mentioned  getting a custom programmed chip for his  928
somewhere on Long Island. As I hope  to "chip" my 928 as well, could  I
ask where that was and what they did?


In  advance, my thank you everyone for your  time. I hope this is not an
imposition.
