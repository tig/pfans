I finally get the crashed 928 to where I can drive it on Sat. I asked =
the body man if it was OK to take it to get air in the tires,  sure he =
said.  So I drove it about a mile in total to my house and it starts =
getting dark so I tried to pop the hood to make sure that its ok to pop =
up the lights the hood would not pop so I reluctantly turned them on.  I =
didn't hear any noise and the headlights never turned on.  So I drove =
the car back and told them about it,  they said they would get it ready =
for me to pick up on Monday night.=20

On Monday I go to pick up the car and for starters the battery is dead,  =
the lights are only part way up and there is a puddle of coolant under =
the car.  He tells me when I turned on the lights the other day that I =
popped a hole in my radiator I got mad and told the guy I wasn't going =
to pay for his mistakes,  we exchanged words attempting to shift blame =
and got nowhere,  all I know is that if I left a conductive tool inside =
a clients computer and told them it was not ready yet but did not warn =
them about not turning it on,  when the next guy shows up to compete the =
job and flips the power guess who is paying for it. =20
I expect the same.  I subsequently went home to look for a puddle where =
I turned the lights on and there was none plus I think I would have =
heard it since I was listening for electrical noise though it may have =
been tough to hear with the motor running. =20
I cant think of anyone who might understand my frustration but y'all =
thanks for listening. =20
I'm sorry about the length of this post but I want to make sure I'm =
understood.

Please offer me some advise?
