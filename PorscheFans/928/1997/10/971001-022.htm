True Story:

Its a sunny Satuday afternoon in Florida and I am driving around town
running errands in my '86 928S (Authority chip, Borla exhaust, Eibach
springs...yadda yadda etc.). A Mustang 5.0 pulls up beside me at a stop
light. I remark to my passenger how too many Mustang owners are genetically
predisposed to racing off the line regardless of the make or model of the
car in the other lane. True to form, the light turns green and vroom goes
the Mustang. An hour later, I am at another stoplight and another Mustang
pulls up along side. My passenger says "do you think they want to race" and
I wager a free dinner if they don't. The light turns green and vroom goes
the Mustang. I win a free dinner and movie. 

After dinner and the movie, another stoplight encounter with a third
Mustang. I look over and to my surprise see that it is the first Mustang
from earlier in the day. The driver is reving his engine and giving me the
finger. The road is a divided well paved/lit road and there are few cars on
the road. I decide it's time to take the bait and see what he's got. 

We both vroom off the line and I am comfortably a car length a head at
60mph. I back off at 80mph because I am approaching a quick right hand turn
onto my favorite twisting two-laned side road. I signal, tap the brakes,
downshift through the gears and make a clean right hand turn. The Mustang
attempts to do the same but fishtails wildly and almost loses control. I
wait for the Mustang to regain his composure before accelerating to speeds
of 100+mph down the deserted road. The Mustang closes in on my bumper when
I slow to enter a wicked left hand curve marked 25mph. I downshift, stay in
the throttle and take the curve at 70mph. The Mustang driver (obviously not
Tommy Kendall) fails to negotiate the turn and ends up spinning out onto a
dirt access road adjoining the apex of the curve. I turn around and offer
my assistance.........Moral of the story: there is more to driving than
smokin' tires off the line.
