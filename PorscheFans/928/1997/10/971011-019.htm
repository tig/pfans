Ok, let's take this a little farther (typical of the 928 driver isn't it
)

How fast did you bring the car up to?  Just wondering.  I went for the
full-tilt on-car balance for a couple of reasons:

1.  I was fighting a bad shake at 90+
2.  Planned top-end use in near future
3.  Procedure recommended by race shop (we all know who of course!)

I am happy to report that to 140 the car has no shakes whatsoever.
Beyond that remains to be seen but I'm very confident in the results.
In any event, this may or may not be what's causing the other car's
vibrations but just a starting suggestion.

aside:
Watched the Blue Angels perform over the SF marina for the 2nd time in
as many days!  Thought about Col. Lucky Ekman - our own real life Top
Gun...  Cool show - two jets doing wheelies side-by-side even!
