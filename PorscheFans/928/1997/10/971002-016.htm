<<In defense of the cat, though-- the air here in the L.A. basin is cleaner

now than it has been in any modern time.  This is thanks to the catalysts

and such that we are so anxious to disable.  Think carefully about your

environmental responsibility before you make this change.  The life you

shorten may be yours... or mine.  Enough said.>>

Not too sure that I agree with this.  Most people wouldn't believe it, but if
your car is kept in good mechanical condition it can run extremely clean
without it's catalytic converters (Look at the new Ferraris that have exhaust
sustems which totally by-pass the cats above 4,000 rpm).  Once hot the cats
really don't do anything for your engine except restrict exhaust flow.  The
only real use for them is at startup when the engine is cold.  I think people
get way too wrapped up in tree hugging and saving us from ourselves.  If
pollution is such a big concern then why not outlaw all boats and offshore
boat racing, all Formula One and Indy car racing, as well as buses, tractors
and all pre 1980's cars (none of which use emissions controls).  Pollution
control is aimed only at the automobile b/c it is just another way for the
government to easily intrude into and restrict out lives in the name of
"concern for our well being."  Heck, maybe they do care - if we all killed
ourselves driving non-catalyst equipped cars who would pick up the tab for
the ridiculous spending and criminal waste of money that occurs everyday?
 And ya know, the air in LA would be a lot cleaner if there were no people
there at all - maybe everyone should move!  If this mindset keeps up we will
all live to see the day that we are TOLD what we can and can't drive and when
we can and can't drive.  Kind of scary.
