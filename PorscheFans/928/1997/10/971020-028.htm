To Chris Barry:

You've used the ideas "cheap", "reliable", "nice exterior", and "under
$5000" all in one paragraph.  Think very carefully before you go out and
buy a $4500 928 - it may have what appears to be a 'nice exterior', but
even a cheap paint job can do that for you.  And what about the mechanicals
underneath?  There's a $5000 engine [even in a 16 valve], a $2000
transmission, and tires that start at $150 per corner.  And do you live in
a snow belt?  Do you want to be driving a thoroughbred on roads where
you're going to spend much of the next four or five months driving
sideways?  Do you want to have your heart broken over a vehicle whose
previous owner neglected to tell you the mechanical and cosmetic truth?

Make no mistake about it - 928's and 944's are demanding mistresses, and
while they give back enormous amounts in driving pleasure, neither of the
two are cheap to run.  Why not look for a good Honda Civic Si, Mazda
MX3-V6, Volkswagen Scirocco/Corrado - even a first-generation Toyota MR2?
Any of these can be found in extremely good shape in your price range, and
while they won't give you the high-end kick that a '28 will, they'll be
about as fast and handle about as well as a $5000 '83 944 - and likely be a
whole lot more reliable in the bargain.

Over 20 years ago, I was where you are now, and I got stung badly on a
Series One E-Jag - same talk about power and handling and reliability, same
stars in my eyes about  what a great car it would be.  It wasn't.
Admittedly, an old 928 is likely to be a tad more reliable than an old
E-Jag, but who is to know for sure?   Wait for a couple of years, Chris;
drive a pocket-rocket for a while.  And then when you can afford a $15,000
928 and her accompanying expenses, jump in with both feet.

Cheers,
Dave Jorgensen
