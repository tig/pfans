Hello fellow "Land Shark tamers":

928 Frenzy Polo Shirts are still available. The color is "Ash" with black
collar and cuffs. The accent color is teal as is the profiled 928S in the
logo. The price in cluding shipping and handling is: $35 for M & L, and $37
fro XL & XXL. Contact me at: eds928s@erols.com for where to send your
check(s).

I would like to hear from folks on the topic of tire pressures for the 928.
As you should know the recommended tire pressure is on a label on the inside
of the fuel filler cover. On my 86 the recommended pressures are: 36 psi for
the fronts and 44 psi for the rears.

With over seven years of driving a 928, and having replaced four sets of
tires,I can say that those pressures are designed to make sure the car
understeers whenever one drives near the limits of adhesion. Over the years
I have noticed certain tell-tail signs as to what the pressures should be
(at least for me). First, as my tires wear down the fronts show excessive
wear on the edges but still good tread in the center. This usually means
"underinflation". Second, the rears wear out in the center first which
usually means "overinflation".

I now run the pressures at 40 psi all around and find that the tires wear
much more evenly. Also, there is considerably less understeer. However, the
likelyhood of going to oversteer is increased accordingly. I caution
everyone that decides to try my set up about the oversteer aspect.

Good luck and happy motoring. Ed
