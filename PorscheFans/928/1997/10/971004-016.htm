According to the Porsche, the same engine was used on all S4s worldwide,
with the same horsepower rating. The stick car may have had an aftermarket
chip set (there are two chips, one for the fuel computer and one for the
ignition computer), which can not only increase power but add "snap" to the
throttle response.

Either is possible, but you may also be experiencing the "start in second"
phenomenon. Stick cars can certainly get off the line faster than auto cars.

>SO...  I would like more power / torque especially at the lower rpm's.

First check the archive here about getting starts in first and kickdowns
all the way down on demand. Then make sure that your car is healthy. Then,
start shopping performance mods (again, check the list archives, along with
Phil Tong's Web site; http://www.928s4vr.com/) for lots of news and thought
on this subject.
