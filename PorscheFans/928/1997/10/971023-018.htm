 Tony, assuming that everything on the engine is in normal condition, 
make sure you have advanced your timing.  I know this is probably obvious 
to you, but it does make quite a difference.  All the euro-engines I've 
had/worked on were pretty limp with timing set at the "factory" settings. 
 I adjust all my engines to around 40 degrees (or more).  This makes the 
arrival of 4100-4200rpm MUCH more evident.  Also, you might want get a 
more free flowing exhaust after the factory headers. This combination 
seems to work extrememly well with the timing changes. And 
finally....although, all my experiences have been ideal as far as 
detonation, *YMMV*.
