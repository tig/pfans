I've used various spec RE71s for years on Lotus, BMW, Miata and others =
and found them to be the stickiest but shortest lasting tyre imaginable. =
 I currently have RE710s on my 928 and they are a great road tyre with =
exceptional wet-weather grip.  They are also very well priced.  They =
don't, however, work as well on the track as the old RE71Rs used to. =
(Not surprising, I know - they will last a LOT longer than the Rs.)

I'd sure recommend the 710s.  They transformed the car over the =
Michellins it used to run.

I've had several sets of RE71s on various cars, and Turanzas on less
sporty stuff, and they've
been great in the wet & dry, and long-wearing (unlike Goodyear Eagle
GTs, which wear out
the day you buy them).

I'll probably need tires for my 82 soon...looking for opinions, esp. any
tire tests you've
found.  The Tire Rack's got some testing info on their web site.

I'm looking for reasonably high mileage, with good wet & dry cornering
and braking.

Opinions? (do I have to ask, on this list?)
