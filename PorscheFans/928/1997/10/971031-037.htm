Leonard Laub responded with directions on preparing a 928 for winter driv=
ing
 (good information, I thought).

However, I assumed that Josh meant that he would be laying the car up for=
 the
winter, especially up in Wisconsin (brrrr!!).  Well, if that=92s what he =
meant,
I can tell you what I do for motorcycles and cars (lawn tractors too).  I=
f
you want to check it out yourself, stop by any motorcycle dealer or
independent accessory shop and usually they will be able to give you a
printed or typed set of winterizing directions.  After 20 years of
winterizing my bikes and cars, I=92ve never had a problem in the springti=
me -
everything always fires up the first time and no gummed up carbs.

1)	Wash/wax car if at all possible at home just before putting it to slee=
p
for the winter, but if you have to drive it to a car wash, do that first =
and
then wax it.

2)	Go to the gas station and fill up the tank and your tires (40 lbs is a
good idea to compensate for winter losses).

3)	Go home and change the oil and filter, use synthetic - 15W50 Mobil 1 i=
s
probably the best overall choice because of a very wide viscosity range.

4)	add the correct amount of =93Sta-Bil=94 gas stabilizer to the gas tank.
 Sta-Bil is recommended by Honda and most other M/C manufacturers, but ot=
her
brands will do.  You can usually get Sta-Bil at an auto parts store, M/C
parts store or a hardware store.  Believe me, stay away from bike stores,
they charge an arm and a leg because they usually sell it only in small
quantities, like 8-oz.  The hardware store will have it in quarts where i=
t is
only a quarter of the unit price charged by the bike shop.  Buy a quart -
save some money.

5)	Take your car out for a 5-mile spin (no more, no less) at a decent eno=
ugh
clip to get everything up to full operating temperature and then park her=
 in
the garage.

6)	When cool enough, pull all your spark plugs and then using an oiler ca=
n
with a long extension spout, squeeze  two or three full shots of oil (sam=
e as
the oil you just put in the car) into each plug hole.

7)	Get inside your car and crank engine a couple of turns to distribute t=
he
oil and create a film on the cylinder walls/pistons.

8)	Replace plugs, torque properly and reinstall plug leads.

9)	Yank battery, add distilled water if necessary, and place in a cool, d=
ry
place - test battery charge once a month and recharge at 1-2 amps if
necessary.  Check once a day until charged.

10)	In the springtime, recharge battery once more, install, and drive hap=
pily
away.  You DO NOT NEED TO CHANGE THE OIL, IT IS MORE THAN OK.  If you cha=
nge
the oil all you=92ve done is waste a lot of money and time.

PS:	By the way, if you drive 5000 miles or less a year, you can change th=
e
oil once just before putting the vehicle away for the winter (if you use =
a
premium synthetic).  I use Mobil 1 in my lawn tractor, change the oil whe=
n I
put it away at the end of the season, and my tractor runs as good as the =
day
I bought it 15 years ago, doesn=92t use a drop of oil, and still is runni=
ng on
the original spark plug.  It=92s pretty unheard of for a Briggs & Stratto=
n to
last that long without a top end rebuild.  Also, someone in the digest
recently mentioned problems with using oils which are =93too slippery=94 =
and
referenced the use of motorcycle-specific synthetics in bikes with wet
clutches (virtually all bikes have wet clutches) to avoid this potential
problem.  Well, this is just a lot of motorcycle-oil company propaganda.
 I=92ve owned more than 30 bikes of all brands and have used nothing but =
Mobil
1 15W50.  I have NEVER had a single incident of clutch slipping or any ot=
her
=93problem=94 with using a car oil instead of a motorcycle oil such as Go=
lden
Spectro, Motul, Bel-Ray, etc.  If you use Mobil 1 in all your vehicles
(whatever they are), you=92ll never be sorry.  Hey, look what=92s written=
 in big
letters on the Porsche GT-1 race car!

Hope this helps.  If it wasn=92t what you meant...maybe it will help out
someone else.

Ciao,

Steve.
