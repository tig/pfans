ARRGH!

My girlfriend dented my car, last day before winterhybernation for the
car and she decides to park it in the garage door post. Right front side
panel got dented... :o(
I must really love her since i have forgiven her already.

OK, let's talk about some fun stuff instead. I'm renting a garage next
to my mechanic this winter. We (read he) will fix various (dents) things
on my car this winter. I'm thinking of making it lighter. I have seen
that you have a -79 that you race. Any recomendations on were to start
making mod's? I'm thinking engine, lexanglass, swaybar, brakes...
I'm posting this to the 928 list aswell. So ANY suggestions on what to
do would be appreciated.

<<I'd like to hear from anyone that has experience in shipping a car across

the country as I might be doing that soon.  Specifically, Virginia to

Seattle.  Names and telephone numbers of trucking firms that specialize =

in

this kind of thing would be appreciated.>>

The names and numbers are all in your local phonebook.  BUT ... they are very
expensive.  I paid only $825 from Delaware to Portland, $725 from Detroit to
Portland, $550 from Dallas to Portland, and $350 from LA to Portland.  This is
about half to a third lower than the retail.  I did this through an account I
had to ship cars. Basically, anyone in the car industry can get a deep
discount by calling enough people.  I found my shippers at the local car
auction.  

Try calling on someone you know that sells cars to arrange the shipping, it
will save you a ton of money.

Also, go over the car VERY well when it arrives.  I had several problems with
cars, but they were all promptly fixed.  Mostly minor, and one major.  Pay on
delivery if possible, then if there are problems they don't already have all
of your money.

Good luck,
