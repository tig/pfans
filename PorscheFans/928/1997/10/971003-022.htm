Joe,
Yes use the jack points, but make sure the jack stands seats are large enough to
seat properly across the factory jack pads. Also double check the jack stands to
see that all 4 legs are firmly on the floor, not tilted to where only 3 or 2
legs are carrying the load and can tip over.
As an added test , shake the car around a bit using the same or more force that
you feel you will be using once under the car ( with the tires and wheels still
on, just in case) to check how sturdy it feels. This will also build your
confidence in the setup once you are under it.

An added thought , if you are real nervous or uncomfortable about it , try
another way. It has been my experience that if you are too nervous about
something this will case you to make bigger mistakes.
 I am sure that all of us who work on our cars (and trucks) have had the thought
of of them falling on us from time to time, this helps us respect the situation
that we are in and to act accordingly.
