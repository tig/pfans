Hi all,

     The radio 'system' in my 90GT just died while I was driving two days
ago.  It's a sony cassette head unit along with 2 amps and CD changer.
The symptoms: CD stop playing all of a sudden, as if the pause button was
pressed,  I managed to switch to radio but could not get the CD changer
going again.   Few minutes later the whole system just went off as if the
power got cut off.   I suspect that there is no electricity going thru the
system since I cannot even unload the CD changer cartridge.  The question
is when I check the fuse box of the car, I cannot locate any fuse that
indicate radio circuit so I am just wondering if there is a fuse protection
for the radio system.    There is also a fuse unit for the head unit but I
wasn't sure whether it would cut off the changers' power line?

     While I'm on line, does anybody with the tire-pressure sensor equipped
cars know how to de-activate the system?   I've changed to 17" cup wheels
and cannot use the pressure checking system anymore but it comes on evey
other minute...  What do you guys do when you upgrade the wheels?

Thanks.

                                                             Alec
