I've been impressed with the economy on my 928, too.  It's an '88 SE 5 =
spd with 97000 miles on the clock.  Before I owned it I had a BMW 535i 5 =
spd which got 16.5 mpg around town and (if I was REALLY careful) 22 mpg =
on a trip.

The 928 gets around 18-19 mpg in town and 25-28mpg on a trip.  (Heheh - =
and about 8 mpg on the track, which is about the same as my Lotus =
Seven!)

We notice mpg a lot in NZ - gas is about $4 a gallon here.

Just out of curiousity, what kind of mileage are people getting?

My 944 regularly gets nearly 30mpg over a mostly highway commute.  I=20
expected a 928
to do quite a bit worse, but my experience to date has been a pleasant=20
surprise.

I've only had the car 2 1/2 weeks and filled it three times.  I picked =
up=20
the car
just outside D.C (alas, it was the weekend after the frenzy!) and drove =
it=20
back home
to Michigan.  The gas gauge was near empty, so I filled it before =
leaving. =20
The next
fillup was after about 350 miles mostly at 65-75 mph (we drove down in =
my=20
wife's Honda
Accord and she was following me back - I thought it would be a bad idea =
to=20
run away
from her), and netted a bit over 26mpg.  I figured the leisurely pace =
was=20
responsible,
but the next fillup came after the opportunity for some more aggressive=20
driving, and
I still got just over 26mpg!

Can I really expect this to continue?

On a side note, when the gauge reads near empty I can only put 13-14=20
gallons in the
tank.  I seem to remember the tank being around 23 gallons.  I'm =
thinking=20
the gauge
is wrong.  Any opinions?
