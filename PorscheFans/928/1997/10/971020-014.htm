928ers

Hope this doesn't post weird, excuse me if it does!

Last month I put $1000 into my '85 928s to replace relays, battery,  the  RPM 
sensor and cleaning of contacts because it cut out and wouldn't start. That 
seemed to fix the problem, but I still held my breath when I turned the key. 

I've since read about hot and cold start circuits from posters with a similar 
problem.
Yesterday, the car balked and started then stranded me two miles from home. It 
turned over but wouldn't fire,  It has been flatbedded to the wrench.

Now I'm thinking fuel pump relay, fuel filter and the fuel system for who 
knows what.......Anybody got any suggestions as to what to check next? 

Thanks in advance  !
