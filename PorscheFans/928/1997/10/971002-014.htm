Well, I still can see the smooth area on the car.  Some of the wax he
applied
on the roof now have some "streak" in it.  Just look like their is some
excess
was that needs to be buffed out.

Yep, this is what I was looking for.  What did the guy recommend and how
did you repack your bearing? (ie quantity of grease, did you use a
pressure
bearing grease packer, etc...)

Manuals were written because they had to due to US laws.  They are meant
as
an assistance to people that had factory training.  This is too bad
because it
would be helpful to keep the car alive if they give manual as nicely
detailed as
for a Honda or Acura car.
