Of course reality is more complex, both generally and in this case. PCNA
decided that the American market would be served by auto S4s because stick
fans would get GTs. The two models ran in parallel through Model Year 1991.
However, there are at least two members of this list with '89 S4 stick
cars, demonstrating that, whether by special order or otherwise, some stick
S4 cars appeared in this country after the introduction of the GT. This may
have persisted through '91.

There are all sorts of subtle appearance items which distinguish the two
models, IF (that's a big "if") no changes have been made to the exhaust
systems, the wheels, the badging on the rear, etc. It's also possible to
check the codes stamped on the engine and transmission, which are different
between GTs and S4s, but again this only works if nothing's been changed.

A simpler and more positive test is to check the M-codes (also called
"option codes") on the white paper sticker in the trunk (lift the rug and
the foam mat; it's stuck to the top of the gas tank). Everyone with a 928
should check this sticker anyway, because it tells you exactly what options
and equipment your car came with; full instructions for finding and
decoding these codes and the VIN are found on Phil Tong's Web site
(http://www.928s4vr.com/) on the "Option Codes" page.

At any rate, if you find code 639, you have a GT. If not, you have an S4.
