A cheap 928.  That'll be the day!

The front fenders and hood are aluminum, I'm pretty sure the doors are
as well.  
The rear fenders are steel as is the roof for "safety" as I read in a
Porsche brochure years ago.  I would think an aluminum roof is safer
than the roof of a 911 cab or Boxster...

A brochure on the 928 from the early 80's made a big deal of all the
heavy galvanizing and special primer on the steel parts to prevent rust.
 Aside from the hatch area, I've never seen rust on a 928.  

I think the hatch rusts due to leaves, dirt, debris getting under the
window trim and the rubber "S" spoiler.  It's a good idea to remove the
spoiler if you have one and inspect/clean the area.  I found allot of
grunge under mine and a rust spot I took care of a few years back.
