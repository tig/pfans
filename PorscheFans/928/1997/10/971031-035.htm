While driving around Austin today in my '97 Mustang Cobra, I happened across
what appeared to be a 1987 or newer 928 S4, black.  We were side by side,
and he was looking at me like he wanted to race (my Cobra is a convertible).

Well, the light turned green and we were off.  Much to his chagrin, I
stomped him.  I was 30 feet ahead until I hit 80, when I slowed down and he
blew by.

So tell me this, honestly:  Did I beat him because I have a faster car, or
did I beat him because I'm a better driver?
