My Federal Employees Credit Union auto specialist says that the average
retail on a good '86 928S is $14,300, loan value is $11,100. I have 18
ads for '86s from all over the USA - average asking price is $14,400. I
just paid $8,600 for one in excellent condition. You just have to be
patient, and ready to jump when the right car appears.

I think that if I had to pay my local Porsche dealer to do my
maintenance and repairs, I couldn't afford the car. The maintenance
records on the '86 show a PO paying $36 to get a headlamp replaced - my
cost would be $8 and 15 minutes. I plan for this to be my daily driver,
and I don't plan to spend $3000 a year, but I will keep the car in top
shape.

Incidentially, I posted a question about the belt tension sensor, and
received several answers, one of which solved my problem. The wire that
goes through the passenger side of the belt cover and plugs onto the
sensor was loose. Thanks, guys! I still wish I knew how the sensor
works, though.

One more question - how the heck do you access the FAQs?
