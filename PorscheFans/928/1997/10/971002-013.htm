Matt, I am happy to ear someone else interested in a 928.  They are
truly fabulous car.  I personally own an 85 which I paid slightly
higher than the one you are looking at.  So personally, I would 
think that, if the car is not perfect, it should go for a bit lower
price.

As far a looking for a car that needs a little work, make sure that
you get some information on part price first.  Some of the parts
are very reasonably priced while others are very expansive (I guess
like any car company nowadays...).  Get the car inspected by a
professional 928 Porsche mechanic and make sure that you know what
you buy.  The 928 is a very reliable car if it was maintained properly.

I also suggest that you join the 928 porschefans list 
( http://www.porschefans.com ).  I will post this letter so that
someone with an early 928 can answer questions on your particular
car.  You should also tell the group where you are located if you
want some advice on a good mechanic (We have over 700 members around
the world who owns 928)

Good luck and if you have more questions, please let me know.

PS. For the Porschefans members, please answer Matt directly until he
joins our rank.
