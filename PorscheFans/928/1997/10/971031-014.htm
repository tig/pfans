Michael,

You wrote,

"3 hours is enough time to do a timing belt change.  Probably want to add a=
n hour if you're going to do the water pump as well (and you should).  It w=
ould take me about 3 hours, now that I've done it once and know what I'm do=
ing.
I'm talking about 16 valve cars, though....I've heard the 32V cars are hard=
er."

Let's not mislead people who are looking for advice by being unrealistic.

I'd like to see ANYBODY do a timing belt change in 3 hours, and do it prope=
rly!  That's ridiculous.  I've done mine, and even though I could do it aga=
in much faster, now that I know what to do, I couldn't possibly do it corre=
ctly that fast.

Well, having said that, now we'll probably see messages from people saying,=
 "I did it in 3 hrs", "I did it in 2hrs", "I did it in 15min.", etc.

Remember, working on a car is not a race.  Take your time and do the job ri=
ght.  Take more time and check and double check everything.  Take the time =
to learn something as you work, and most of all, ENJOY what you're doing.  =
Like anything else, when you rush it, you get in trouble.

I know, the original post was about a DEALER doing the job in 3 hours.  I s=
ay if they're attempting to do it that fast, they're not paying enough atte=
ntion to what they're doing.  Maybe they're only going to CHARGE you for 3 =
hours but it might take them longer.  Now that would be a good deal, howeve=
r, pretty unlikely.  They wouldn't stay in business long at that rate.
