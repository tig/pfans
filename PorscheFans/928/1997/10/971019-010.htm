I agree, Steve's request is reasonable. Did everybody get switched over to 
digest form this weekend too? Did you see the awful garbage several posts 
turned into? Actually they didn't "turn into" because they were sent that 
way originally.

And Steve, your message was MIME'ed too, but maybe not labeled properly in 
the headers. That's why I got it double spaced with = signs at the end of 
your lines.

Sent a querry to our listmeister and got an automatic reply formletter. One 
of the items listed was general complaints about digest format being MIME 
and ugly. Well, the digest format I saw was pretty but unmanagable. My 
email program (exmh) can burst MIME digests back to the original messages 
so I can sort to my liking and readily reply as needed.
