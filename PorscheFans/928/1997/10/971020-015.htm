I also have an '84 and had sunroof problems.  If the adjustments don't do 
it for you right off, take the roof out and check it out.  There are just 
two screws, one on each guide that move it.  First time I took EVERYTHING 
apart, then found out I did not need to.

Upon inspection, I found a plastic part that the roof fits into (which is 
part of the cable) was broken.  I think the cable was around $40 two years 
ago.  While your there, clean out all the old grease and apply new.  I 
forget exactly what I used, it was from Wurth.  Getting the roof back in 
properly was a bit of a hassle, it's a bit awkward.  Not a good thing to do 
on a windy day.  It would no doubt be easier with two people, one on each 
side.

Once in, adjust as needed.  There are two large head screws in the front 
crossmember and one on each side near each guide that adjust the roof. 
 Start with it way down and adjust up to prevent more scratches.  Have 
someone move the roof for you a little at time while you watch slide back 
and check for clearance.  When it seals good all around and slides back 
without touching, your done.  More clearance is better than none.

Once the broken part was fixed, adjusting was really straight forward and 
easy.  If your having problems, take it apart as you may have one of those 
plastic guides broken.  I spent hours adjusting it until I broke down and 
pulled it apart.

To assure a good adjustment, place a strip of masking tape across the roof 
(left to right) near the front, middle and rear of the roof. Add another 
strip of tape so that you have two layers of tape.  The roof should slide 
back without nicking the tape.

My roof slides quick and easy, better than ever.  I could not believe the 
difference!  No doubt the sunroof motor was under allot more strain before 
the new lube.

I think mine broke because I would open it when doing highway speeds. 
 Verboten according the owner manual I found out later.  Too much strain 
from wind resistance perhaps.
