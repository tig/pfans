Thought I'd chime in on this thread.

On-car balancing is a good tool to have in your hip pocket for 
situations *real* tire balancing doesn't work.

A *real* off-car dynamic balance job balances the tire/wheel about
3 axis rather than the single axis of your car's axel. A tire that
does not shake at speed may pull and make the car feel out of 
alignment.

If an on-car balance cures problems an off-car balance couldn't, then
you were balancing the wrong thing in the first place. I'd guess your
brake rotors are out of balance.

I had a car on jack stands for a number of years, without wheels
mounted. Developed a nice pile of rust dust under each brake rotor
where the rotors simply fell apart. In a heated garage. Tapping the
rotors caused even more rust to fall out.

As big as the 928's brakes are, it wouldn't take much unbalance to
cause problems. Look inside your front 928 rotors, mine have balance
weights.
