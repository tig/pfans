	Yes, it's true, I got spanked on the freeway today by a 1989  911 turbo. He 
could pull on me at any time, and seemed to have no turbo lag. When we got off 
the freeway, we had a chat at the stoplight, it was a RUF Turbo conversion. He 
said he had about 430 horsepower, and no one else ever kept up with him, up to 
1XX+ mph. His car had new car dealer plates, so maybe he just bought it, or he 
can't get it smogged. The car was absolutely flawless though. Well, now I know 
I need that 6-liter kit!! 

Happy G-forcing
