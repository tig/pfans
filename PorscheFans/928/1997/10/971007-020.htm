Paul:

I just had a similar problem with my car, an 87, and had it fixed.

First, if the ABS System does not work, the regular brakes will.

You have four possible problems causing this situation.  First, it
simply could be a loose ground wire.  If you tighten it the problem is
solved.  Second, there could be debris in the sensor.  Clean it and you
are OK.  Finally, you might require a new sensor.   That could be rather
expensive (+/-$300 for new parts & labor).  If you need a sensor, give
David Roberts a call - he can save you some bucks. His e-mail is usually
on this list.  Fourth, it could be a problem with the main break
computer.  Very expensive!   Again, call Dave Roberts for parts.

Good Luck,

Jerry O'Brien
