Today's kill:

I was driving on the toll way today in my black 928S4 when I stopped at a
toll booth. I deposited my change into the basket, the arm at the booth
raised, and I began to drive off at a normal pace. After having driven just
a few feet I noticed a guy on my left, who was also just pulling out of the
next toll booth, in a Honda CRX. He glanced over, and then floored it. A
very minor flick of my right foot and I pulled up to him, passed him, and
left him behind as I continued to accelerate to about 60 MPH. His engine
sounded like a  blender set to "liquify", while I never saw even 3000 RPM
at any point.

I know, I know... but I just recently got the car and nobody else has been
naive enough to challenge it yet. :)
