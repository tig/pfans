<that almost sounds like a post for a different list but was all I could
think of>

I believe overall the 928 is a fairly stiff car by design...  Some of
the variables to contend with as we all do this lift the car and close
the door test:

1.  height car was raised
2.  alignment of door & striker
3.  age / use of vehicle
4.  car lifted on incline
5.  jack point / support used
etc.

I noticed on the '84 that if the car were raised fairly high the driver
door (don't recall the other side) would have a harder time closing.
Lower and no problem.  Hatch always opened/closed.  Didn't try
opening/closing the hood.  The '90 shows no difficulties.

Either way I agree this isn't an accurate measurement...
Phil
