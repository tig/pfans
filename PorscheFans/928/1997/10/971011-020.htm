Phil I never heard the "rest of the story"... did you actually lose
brakes along with the clutch? That's not supposed to happen. Which hose
let go? No warning? What can I learn from your experience? Also sorry to

learn of your shifter problem. Any advance warning on that?

Hiya Del:

I didn't get (or want) to drive the car after that hose blew.  I was
pulling into a parking lot, the clutch pedal went to the floor and
stayed and I parked immediately.  So yes there was enough fluid to stop
with from 5mph.  While inspecting the car I found the resevoir empty as
far as I could see, with the last of the fluid still dripping
underneath.  I've heard from alot of others with similiar occurances, so
that little hose is something we all need to be aware of and change
regularly, say every 50k or 4-5 years.  Next time your under the car,
look for it close to the driver's side wheel.  I suppose it could be
replaced by a hard line or braided stainless hose but figuring it was
originally designed in rubber to allow for some play.

***

Now that silly plastic cup for the shifter is another story.  Definately
a PITA to service since the ball it rides on just happens to be mounted
on the forward part of the torque tube.  I have no idea why they did
that instead of allowing for a shifter mounted design to facilitate
easier servicing.  Ohh.... never mind!  Anyways, the only symptoms I
could describe are that shifts felt less than precise but otherwise no
excessive play.  It just popped out and then the shifter felt like a wet
noodle - not able to engage any gear.  Luckily for me after some
jiggling, it popped back in temporarily.

The bad news so far:
I've dropped the shields, cats and body brace to get at the cup.  After
reading about much grief with the shifter & associated springs, I really
don't want to remove it!  The main problem I'm having now is limited
clearance with the tube in place - I can fit a 17mm wrench on the nut
but have no room to turn it.  I recall seeing an ' obstruction wrench '
- basically a big U-shaped open end - which might do the trick to get
around the tube.  Either that or I'll have to make a wrench?  This is a
good challenge.  (A less sophisticated fix would be to tie a coat hanger
around the whole mess, at least to get to a shop but hey we've come this
far already).

Oh well, lots of other things I can take the time to do ie. oil change,
plug check/change, seat bolts, reglue door carpet, etc.  Now that the GT
is the only car in the garage, it's hogging up the whole thing!

Phil
