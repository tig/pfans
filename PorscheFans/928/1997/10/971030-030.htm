hmmmm. lets see which one do i recount..... ah so many experiences so
little space.. well lets just say that a full rsr bodyworked biplane winged
c4 with a turbo motor, 275 and 315's as tires, a sport exhaust and megatint
windows will get you a ticket everytime. no discussion, no humor, no
sympathy. no you dont have to be speeding, but then again i cant use that
defense. its not a matter of whether, but how much. i have been followed,
stalked, goaded, tailgated, decoyed, the works. god bless them, they make
my longer drives interesting.... one time in 00029 i was pulled over and
searched, all the way to the under the battery cover [ no box on th ereally
old cars] the cop claimed to have me but he was in the outside southerly
lane while i was in the outside noterhtly lane and we were both in traffic.
put on his lights at a stoplight and pulled me over after we were both
thru. he had to write a speed ticket to justify his stop. naturally a
discussion with the persecutor got this ticket pulled. beleive it or not
the flame never got a ticket even with the radical paint or as a
widebody... thank you God. those would have been impounds.

on the other hand i must point out that any of the finest that are my
clients are absolutlely mistake free, as are all my clients...
