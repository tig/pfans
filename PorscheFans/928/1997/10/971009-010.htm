I've always kept a journal in all my cars. Write down the tank milage,
gallons, price, odometer, and MPG. Simlar for oil changes, new tires,
alignments, etc.

But the important thing about writing down gas, brand, and MPG, is
that rotten gas will show as rotten MPG. You can't rule out a tank
at 18 MPG is rotten when you're used to 19.5, but you can look for
trends.

This was really hammered home when I owned a 1978 Dodge (Mitsubishi)
Challenger. Shouldn't have bought the car new when I learned it had
points in the ignition. It ate points. New points == 24 MPG. Car
about to die with bad points == 20 MPG. Got 6k miles on Standard
Blue Streak points, 2k on K-Mart.

Currenlty may cars seem to like Exxon regular better than anything
else. And the convinence store where I buy Exxon also sells Chevron 
Techron in the little black bottles for about 60% of the Chevron
dealer's retail price.
