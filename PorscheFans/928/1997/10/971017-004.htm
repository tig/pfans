  If your '83 is US-spec with L-Jetronic, pay close attention to 
  Temp Sensor II and the wiring that leads to it.  The engine will die
  if the signal from this sensor it interrupted.
  
  Some particulars to check:
  
    1) verify proper resistance values for the sensor as the temperature
       at the sensor changes.
    2) make sure the two-prong connector to the sensor is making good and
       continuous contact.  An original connector is probably going to be
       very brittle by now and will not tolerate being connected/disconnected
       very often.  Even if the plastic case of the connector looks good,
       verify that the female wire connectors inside the case are shaped
       properly to grasp the spades on the sensor.
    3) Make sure the PO didn't do something strange (like the PO of my car
       did) and solder a resistor in series on one of the wires to the sensor
       in an attempt to alter the mixture.  My intermittant no-start problem
       appears to have gone away after I got rid of that gremlin (but I still
       keep my fingers crossed!).
