My car does the same thing.  From what I can tell, I have a bad front

you press the ! button, it cancels out the ABS, so this test must be
performed with the ! button lit.

Except for the later cars, these are high hp, low torque, engines.  They
love to rev.  The automatic just make matters worse.
