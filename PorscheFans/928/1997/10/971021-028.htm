Leonard, Jim,

This situation is getting really interesting now....

I found the engine stamping right where Jim said it would be.  Check
this out:

	M28 / 45

	89G0072

The engine stamping doesn't match the build sticker on the back of the
car (see below).  Leonard, according to your earlier post, the M28 / 45
engine is an Aussie spec engine.  I was beginning to think this may be
an Aussie car but the steering wheel is on the correct (left) ;-> side.
  Also, what's up with the "89G" on the engine serial number?

FWIW, the VIN for the car is as follows:

	WPOZZZ92ZGS840239

I would interpret that as:

	WPOZZZ  	- Porsche, non US vehicle
	92		- 928
	Z		- filler symbol, not applicable?
	G		- 1986 model
	S		- Made in Stuttgart
	8		- Unknown
	4		- Body type?
	0239		- Serialization for the previous sequence of digits (i.e.., 239th
Euro 928 in 1986)

My guess is that this is a Euro spec car but destined for another
country outside the EU.  Either that, or as the trunk sticker indicates,
the car originally had a 16V motor and it was replaced with an Aussie
spec engine for some reason.

Again, MUCHO MUCHO GRACIAS for your help!!!!

Regards,

Bert
