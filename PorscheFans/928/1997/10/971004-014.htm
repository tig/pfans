Alois Ruf runs a company which makes extensive (and expensive)
modifications to 911s and does this so thoughtfully and painstakingly that
Ruf is recognized by the German government as a car manufacturer. Their
cars are sold and modified as Ruf cars, not Porsche cars.

You can read about a recent Ruf model (with considerably more power) in the
recent Excellence magazine; also check
http://www.olemiss.edu/~waletail/ruf/ctr2.htm. For some years now, Ruf has
been selling cars with honest top speeds well in excess of 200 mph, but
with very nice road manners. They just cost a lot, and still look like
911s. No, at least as far as I know, Ruf does not modify 928s.

>Well, now I know I need that 6-liter kit!!

At least! Meanwhile, choose your battles with care, Grasshopper.
