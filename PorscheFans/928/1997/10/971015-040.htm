I am also experiencing the hot start problem that Michael Cottam listed in
the digest here on10/9.  My car started only when I jumped the battery
using my battery charger.  When started it runs fine.  When I restart the
car a second time after being off for a short period it starts fine on its
own.  After running for about five minutes the engine dies and will not
fire with or without the battery charger.  The car only has 35k miles so I
did not know what to expect.

I did not have enough patience to t-shoot the problem so I took it to the
local dealer.  The mechanic has it narrowed down to the main computer (all
$1400 worth).  He is getting a test computer from some company that has one
available for this purpose before buying one since most electrical items
are not returnable.  I thought this was a good thing since it would not be
fun to replace the computer and not have the problem fixed.  He is also
looking at a possibly getting one from 928 International if available.

Hopefully this may help Michael if he has not solved the problem on his
car.

Open to any other suggestions if anybody out there has similar experience.
