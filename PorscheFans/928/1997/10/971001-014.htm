First off, the Frenzy rocked.  Thanks to everyone for everything they did.
(What, you were expecting more eloquent thanks from someone who would wear
camouflage pants to a 928 event?  ;-D )

Anyway, now to subject at hand.  I have located a '90 S4 locally in good
shape (38k miles, even still has the belly pan), and I need to figure out
how to move forward in checking it out properly (I took a brief look at it
this morning on my way to work).

1) What is the highest price I should consider paying for this car?  It
meets my criteria of what I want in a 928 ('87+, LSD, auto, rear air, even
a nice color), but misses perfect on three counts (not a GTS, not
brand-new, tan interior [and I'm not sure that this is all bad, since it
will be cooler in the sun]), so I am willing to walk away from it if the
price is wrong.  The PO is a doctor, second owner, claims to have properly
maintened and has records (I didn't check them out).

2) Can anyone suggest a good 928 diagnostic mechanic to check the car out?
Yes, I know that ASG is an obvious choice, but just because they were a
good site for the Frenzy doesn't automatically make them the best for
checking out a shark...  Also, anything anyone might suggest I look at
closely myself?

3) I found something minorly perplexing--I looked for the option sticker in
the trunk, and I believe I found it, but
        a) there were two of them (not worrying, just weird)
        b) 220 was not listed--LSD went standard for '90, so did they stop
putting
the option code down?

Now, on a lighter note...  While looking through the option code list on
Phil's site, I found this:

221 Porsche-locking differential

What is it, a differential that should only be locked by the dealer using a
special $500 tool?  ;-D
