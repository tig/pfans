GOOD FOR YOU, a job well done!
love to see it some time if you ever in California.

>There are exceptions to this rule if the buyer has competent knowledge of

weekends of

Like you said, a $1,500   928 plus $3 to 4,000 more fixed.  thats almost
$5,000 928.

same as someone who brought a $5,000 928 and will need $3-5000 repairs. 

The moral of this mail is to let NEW owners (want to be)  to know that a
$1,500 can cost $4,000 to fixed to get back on the road.  or a $5,000 928
will likely cost $3,000 more to get back on the road.   Just to inform buyers
to be careful to buy a 928.   Money does not grown on tree, you earn it!
