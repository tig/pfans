I have a few questions about the early aluminum balls joints and brake
pressure sensors.

1.  Last year, my girl friend had a lower ball joint failure coming out
of a driveway. We had both replaced but there appeared to be more parts
involved than just the ball joints alone.  What parts are required for
the job?  When she had it replaced, the mech. got new eccentrics (he
claims it's a dealer part only), lower shock mount, and the ball joint
itself.  Can the old parts (eccentrics...) be used with the updated ball
joints?

2.  I posted this problem before but the one suggestion solved part of
the problem.  The problem is a brake pressure warning light.  I learned
how to reset the light but it still keeps coming on.  After resetting the
light, everything appears to normal but when I step on the brakes, it
goes off again.   How do I check for a faulty sensor and which one is the
correct sensor I should be looking at?  Is the problem somewhere else?  

Thanks in advance....
