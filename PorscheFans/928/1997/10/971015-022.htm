  I haven't done this for a few years, but I recall that the horn pad
  can be pryed off by inserting a large screwdriver next to plastic
  tabs that attach the pad to the wheel.  Double check that there aren't
  any screws to remove from the back of the wheel first.

  No puller needed.  Just remove the large nut and work the steering wheel 
  off the shaft by gently rocking it side to side.

  I've appended some helpful hints that Phil Eskildsen had posted on
  22 May '97 about dashboard removal.

*********************Notes from Phil Eskildsen****************

  A 1/4" drive swivel-head socket drive bar is VERY useful. This is not
the same thing as the 360 degree swivel adapter found in every socket
set, but is a straight 1/4" drive non-ratcheting socket handle whose
head swivels 180 degrees.  3" and 5" extensions in 1/4" drive size will
prove useful. A yellow paint pen (available from art supply houses) is
the same thing as the 360 degree swivel adapter found in every socket
set, but is a straight 1/4" drive non-ratcheting socket handle whose
head swivels 180 degrees.  3" and 5" extensions in 1/4" drive size will
prove useful. A yellow paint pen (available from art supply houses) is
useful in marking parts and positions and easier to see than nail
polish.

  The five knobs on the pod just pull off the pod switches. The switches
can be pulled forward by using two small screwdrivers to push the 'ears'
together and pry the switches out through the front.  Then the switches
can be unplugged from their connectors.  Mark everything. When you
reassemble the pod, you will never be able to get the plugs onto the
switches from the rear.  You will need to pull the cables and plug ends
through the holes in the pod, then attach and seat the switches.

  The instrument cluster has three edge-card connectors.  Mark polarity
before removing.

  If something doesn't come out easily or hangs, look for a hidden
bolt.  I remember one inside the center a/c vent (pry out vent with
spatula), one indide the glovebox, and two at each rear edge of the
console (broken tabs).
