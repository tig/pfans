<<Everyone seems to be telling me my car is junk because the door won't close

on my 928 with one wheel jacked off the ground.>>

Well, it's obvious that the "everyone" that you are referring to has been
talking out of their a**.  Having one wheel off the ground puts strain on any
chassis, not just the 928.  It isn't a 4 X 4.  I'm sure that the people
telling you this crap drive trucks or Yugo turbos, or something to that
effect.  Kind of hard for me to believe that a car that when new costs more
than most peoples homes can ever be junk.
Tell them that you're glad that they don't like your car b/c that will leave
more 928's out there for all of us!
