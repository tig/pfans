Our 81 came only with the valet key. Now when we try to order a 
master, the parts guy, Mike Riley of Bluegrass Motorsport, Louisville,
 says the master will be longer if the car has an alarm so he needs 
to know. ($39.68 with tax.)

He didn't know how I could tell. Can any of you advise?

Joke below, rated PG:

Three pregnant women. First one says, "I'll have a boy, ' cause I was 
on the bottom." Second one, "I'll have a girl, 'cause I was on top." 
Third, "That son of a bitch! I'm gonna have puppies!"
