I understand 8:00am.  I plan to be early, around 7:30 - just in case.

Alameda County Sheriff's Training Facility at Santa Rita, Dublin

Take 580 East.  Exit Tassahara road (this is a mile or so east of the
580/680
intersection). Go North on Tassahara back over 580.  Turn left at sign
Highway Patrol.  The AutoX area is just behind the Highway Patrol
building.
You should be able to see a lot of Porsches as you get near

> Price?
Since this is an official PCA event, participation will be limited to
members.  Cost is probably nominal,  but I don't know for sure. Phil
Tong's been before so he probably can answer that question. Bring some
money for the soda machine.  There are no paid workers.  Drivers also
pull some other kind of duty - corner worker etc.

> Safety equip?
Car must pass tech inspection. Check is for firmly attached battery, no
loose wheel bearings, oil leakage, working brakes, adequate tire tread
as far as I know. Seatbelts (standard is ok, I think) and helmet are
required, and mounted fire extimguisher(?).  I'm not sure as I think I
have everything except the helmet.  I understand loaner helmets are
available.  I plan to borrow a helmet until I know more about what I
should buy.  There is a vast range in helmet prices/styles/features.

>or maybe we can go together..
I'll see you there!
