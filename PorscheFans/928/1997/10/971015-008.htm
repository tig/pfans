Last week I installed Michelin MXX3's on my factory front wheels ('87
S4, 5 spd.) so thought I'd give them a speed test.  I touched 150 on the

speedo while heading west on Hwy 98 from Calexico, Calif.  This is not a

great road in that it is narrow (2 lanes) and has numerous gentle dips
and curves, but the 928 was still accelerating.  My impressions were
that this speed is not comfortable, at least on this kind of road, due
to wind noise and lightened steering.  But 120 is fine.
I experienced a pronounced shaking at about 100 which is the reason I
had replaced the front tires (XGTV's, V-rated).  The shaking wasn't
really noted through the steering wheel so perhaps the rear tires should

be replaced also.  These, too, are the XGTV's although they were
carefully balanced a few weeks ago.  Unfortunately, they still have
about 50% tread left so I guess I'll drive on them for a while longer
but at more reasonable speeds.
