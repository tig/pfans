Hello fellow "Land Shark tamers":

To the person that asked about the "best" 928 mechanic in the Metro DC area,
there are many.
In Gaithersburg, MD there are: "Autotherapy" & "Stuttgart Performance
Engineering". In Rockville, MD there are: "Autowerke & Autoy" & Rockville
Porsche (Dealership).

I would like to hear from everyone that would like to help with the
formation of the "928 Club". We have an opportunity to reach several
thousand 928 owners with a targeted mailing going out early next year. Let
me know soon if you can help and in what capacity.

 An article on the "Frenzy" will be published in the November issue of the
PCA Potomac Region newsletter "Der Vorganger". I'll have extra copies once
it's on the street. Kim Crumb is in the process of preparing an article on
the event for "Panorama". I don't know when it will be published.

928 Frenzy Polo Shirts are still available. The color is "Ash" with black
collar and cuffs. The accent color is teal as is the profiled 928S in the
logo. The price including shipping and handling is still: $35 for M & L, and
$37fro XL & XXL. Contact me at: eds928s@erols.com for where to send your
check(s).

Good luck and happy motoring. Ed
