When I was 16 I had already been working for two years and I had =
acquired by myself, without my parents permission, my first car, a 924. =
This car was pretty unreliable, but it was very nimble. After months of =
taking abuse and being told to sell the car to get something more =
reliable, i was driving my mother to the store when a black cat ran out =
into the street. It was a pretty big 2 lane street and I was doing about =
45 (speed limit 35) - Luckily (for the cat) I was able to swerve around =
it, all the while retaining my composure. The move was so graceful that =
I was thoroughly impressed with myself, so I had to blurt out 'If this =
was your tercel, me or that kitty would be dead!'

I never got any more abuse about owning my little toy. Eventually I sold =
it for a profit and have regretted it ever since. (Well, until i got my =
928 that is)
