     Hey PorscheFans:
     
     Anybody know which model year the ball joints were switched to steel 
     from aluminum?  This recent thread has got me worried that my front 
     end is going fall off next time I hit a pothole, leaving me holding a 
     steering wheel and sitting on the road like Wiley Coyote.
     
     Also, everybody must go out and beg borrow or steal a copy of the 
     December issue of excellence.  There are three articles that feature 
     the 928.  First, there is a 928 Market Update by the esteemed Bruce 
     Anderson.  A must read.  (Thank you, Bruce)  Second, there is an 
     article about Devek's 6.something liter triple-purpose 928 monster.  
     Third, there is an extremely interesting article about Ferry Porsche's 
     birthday cars, two of which were special examples of the World's 
     Finest GT.  And as if that weren't enough, (and by golly, don't you 
     think it ought to be?) this issue contains an index to all the issues 
     that have come before and references every technical forum and 
     discussion by subject area, model, etc.  Buy it.  Subscribe.  Read to 
     your children...

     P.S. 
     
     I spoke to a quite pleasant woman who answered the number below and 
     she told me that they will take your subscription order over the phone 
     but that it is too late for new subscribers to get the December issue 
     as part of their subscription.  However, for $5.00 they will send it 
     as a back issue in a few weeks.
