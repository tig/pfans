Jay,

Awwwww.  Having to put my car away for half the year would make me sad, =
too.

Fortunately, however, it is the start of our summer and my thoughts are =
more centered around making sure that the aircon is working ready for =
some serious miles over the next few months.

I'll think of you...

Regards,

Heavy Sigh!

I have increased my ground clearance to about 18" for the next 7 months.
Winter came early to Vermont last night. I hope you guys in warmer =
climates
are enjoying your cars cause I'm getting kinda bumbed out. A good end to =
my
first season as a shark owner. A good opportunity to continue my
restoration project. Paint in January (yeehaw), engine out and =
regasketed
in the spring. For now my thoughts are turning to waxing my skiis.=20
