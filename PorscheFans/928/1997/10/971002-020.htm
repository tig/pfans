I am a new '86 928S owner. I'm still learning how to drive it, but already
thinking about performance upgrades. I know very little about my options and
would rather do nothing than to make a big mistake. I have information on
Autothority's chip and DEVEK headers. Is one or both of these a good bet? Can
they be used effectively together? Will the re-timing suggested by DEVEK be a
cost effective alternative to the chip? What realistically can I expect from
either of these two upgrade options, which I understand are roughly $800 a
piece. Does maintenance increase with these relatively modest modifications?
Are there alternative upgrades to consider? Thanks for any thoughts on these
questions. So far I have been able to ignore the taunting Mustangs, but my
patience is waning. Thanks again in anticipation of a response.
