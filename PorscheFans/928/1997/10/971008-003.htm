KThei from Gene O'Rourke:abeo@worldnet.att.net.  I'll be away from my 
computer in Fla. until the end of Oct. but if anyone wants to contact me 
on this car I cqan be reached at 401-781-6137 until then.
I looked at aand drove an 86S five speed in Conn.  Red/black apparently 
always garaged, as the car looks like new.  The young guy who owns it 
paid 14,000 for it last year at that tiime it had 59M miles and now has 
72,300.  He still owes 11,300 on it and willsell for that amount just to 
get cleaar of the bank loan.
It drives like a new caar, brakes and clutch both feel strong.  Good 
rubber and the engine comp. looks clean.  He bought it from a dealer and 
doesn't know the history, never spent a dime on it so also doesn't know 
it the 60,000 tuneup has been done.  I asked him if he knew whether the 
original timing belt had been changed and again he knew nothing about it.
From all appearances it is awell cared for car.

If anyone is interested contact me at the R.I. number llisted above.  
There  is no answering machine but I'll be there most of the tiime.

Gene O'Rourke
