A woman is fast approaching 40 years of age and is without a 
partner. This situation has her rather depressed due to
her long history of failed relationships. After much debate she 
decides that the best thing to do is to take out a personal
ad in the paper:
Wanted: A good lover to be my friend; who won't beat me and won't run
out  on me.
After a week or so no one has responded to the ad. She is feeling
particularly depressed when the door bell rings.
She opens the door to find a man with no arms and no legs lying on the
front porch. Quite surprised at the sight she
asks him what he wants.
He replies, "I'm responding to your ad for a good lover."
"How can that be? You have no arms and no legs!"
"I have no arms so I can't beat you, and I have no legs so I can't run
out on you!" he said.
"What about being a good lover?" she asked.
He responded, "I rang the doorbell didn't I?"
