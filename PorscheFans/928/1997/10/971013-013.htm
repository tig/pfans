<<I'd like to hear from anyone that has experience in shipping a car across

the country as I might be doing that soon.>>

Tom,
There are quite a few places out there that specialize in that sort of thing,
and I have never heard anything bad about any of them.  Alex Gonzalez just
had his new 928 shipped from San Antonio to San Francisco and I think he was
pleased with the service.  Only problem is that it is expensive.  The
cheapest place I have ever heard of is $792.00.  But that includes door to
door delivery and a $1 million, zero deductible insurance coverage.  Here are
a couple of places that I know of.
A-1 Auto Cargo - ask Alex for the number (alex3@compuserve.com)
Horseless Carriage - 800-631-7796
Passport Transport - 800-325-4267

Regards,
Brian Buxton
