Hi everyone, as I mentioned yesterday I have seen photos of an interior
someone had completely recovered with leather look vinyl.  The man that
did the work is Ed Wolfred and he's in Virginia, phone 540-322-2121. It
was like $3000 and he did nearly every inch of the interior.

You may have noticed 928 leather doesn't hold up as well as the leather
in American and Japanese cars.  Interestingly enough, its' thinner
because of the ways the cows are raised.  In Europe cows are kept under
much more controlled conditions than in the U.S. because of less roaming
space.  The rougher conditions here (weather, barbed wire, etc) results
in thicker leather.
