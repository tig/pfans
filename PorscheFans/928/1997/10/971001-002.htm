.... Another poster mentioned an obsolete MB-Quark speaker set.  My '89
has
dried-out cones and surrounds, and needs some help.  I'd like to
maintain
the stock appearance throughout if possible.  Any recommendations on
replacements?

The easy way:
Purchase a good set of exact replacements from someone here or 928
International and be happy it was so easy.  They don't sound too bad and
you could add a sub tube for the low frequencies they fail to produce.

The hard way:
Maintaining the stock / stealth look is what makes this hard as the
stock grills screw onto the factory speakers!  (This is also one of the
first tips I learned from LL - thanks again).   The trick is to find a
way to mate the new speakers to the old mounts to retain the stock
grills.  Jim Murphy has done this on his factory 8-speaker S4 with great
success.  The front door tweeters are especially trick, fitting in a
hollowed out stock mount, with the tweeters angled to the listeners.
The rear 6.5's are easy to put behind the factory grill but watch the
speaker depth as I found the close proximity to the metal body throws
off deeply mounted magnets.

The 10-speaker setup on later cars have the same grill caveat except
that the 6.5 rear has a different cover that snaps on to the form-fitted
mount.

The other trick to watch out for is the stock tweeters are wired off the
mids/woofers with a cap.  This may or may not adversely affect your head
unit or amp depending upon what they are to begin with.  I think it was
Bill Kelley that posted a pretty informative thread on the push-pull amp
/ speaker setup a while back too.  Gotta check them archives and FAQs~

In short, going to *better* aftermarket drivers will require alot more
planning and installation time to get the full effect.  I also forgot to
mention that you'll have fun doing wiring if you *correctly* want to use
phat new wire but retain the stock fader if equipped.  Some trade offs
might be required and I'd say the factory fader is one of them, I would
rather use the head unit or eq unit to fade anyways...

If all this sounds like overkill, just remember all the time you spend
behind the wheel, or lacking that, the desire at least to make it
sonically appealing when you're not listening to that great motor or
tire of road noise.

Whatcha' think now dr. bob?  Me?  I am secretly lusting after that cool
Alpine unit with the LCD screen and some non-intrusive subwoofer setup
for all my old gear.
