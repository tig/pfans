Hello fellow Shark fans:

What is the multiplier to determine HP at the crank off a dyno report
which calculates HP and torque at the wheels?

I have 2 sets of numbers for a 1980 2 valve U.S. which was recently
completely Euro-Fied by Lucky and the Devek folks in their east coast
shop:

Before: 202.9 @ 5100 RPM with 208.9 ft-lb.

After: 236.3 @5100 RPM with 243.4 ft-lb.

I was wondering what the formula is to calculate the advertised HP
(presumably at the crank??) for this car? I know the spec for a 1980 2
valve is around 220 BHP according to the owners guide. 

How does this compare to a factory prepared Euro? This car has the
smaller underlying block (4.6 liter I think, whereas doesn't the Euro
have a 4.8 liter?), but with the Devek headers, tuned port induction and
Devek cams it is now a modified Euro-S configuration. As an aside, I was
wondering if I really Should I have gone to a factory Euro swap rather
than upgrade the basic US spec 2 valve (no buyers remorse just wondering
if all i have really accomplished is to perfume a pig) :-0 :).

Thinking about doing a Pantera as the next project (any opinions about
modifying a 351 Cleveland versus doing another 928?)
