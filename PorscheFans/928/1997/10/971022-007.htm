Just out of curiousity, what kind of mileage are people getting?

My 944 regularly gets nearly 30mpg over a mostly highway commute.  I 
expected a 928
to do quite a bit worse, but my experience to date has been a pleasant 
surprise.

I've only had the car 2 1/2 weeks and filled it three times.  I picked up 
the car
just outside D.C (alas, it was the weekend after the frenzy!) and drove it 
back home
to Michigan.  The gas gauge was near empty, so I filled it before leaving.  
The next
fillup was after about 350 miles mostly at 65-75 mph (we drove down in my 
wife's Honda
Accord and she was following me back - I thought it would be a bad idea to 
run away
from her), and netted a bit over 26mpg.  I figured the leisurely pace was 
responsible,
but the next fillup came after the opportunity for some more aggressive 
driving, and
I still got just over 26mpg!

Can I really expect this to continue?

On a side note, when the gauge reads near empty I can only put 13-14 
gallons in the
tank.  I seem to remember the tank being around 23 gallons.  I'm thinking 
the gauge
is wrong.  Any opinions?
