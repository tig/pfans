Greetings all!
Long time listener, (archive lurker) first time caller. (poster?)
I too was bitten long ago by the 928 bug and tried plastic chevys and 
the like to cure it.  (427's are nice exept for the 80/20 weight 
distribution...)  I love it for all the reasons posted by others and 
many more.  Anyway, I've had my '85 5 speed for about three years and 
have had a blast since day one. (lotsa stories)  I've done all the usual 
(door locks, wheel bearings, rack with a home alignment...but thats 
another story...etc.)  and I've got the same list of "to dos" that a lot 
of us have, but my concern of late is my lack of dash lights.
One evening awhile back the inside went dark!! I've checked the fuse 
(the cig lighter still powers the detector), there's no power to the 
dimmer rheostat, I've cleaned the two main connectors under the pod, and 
I'm out of ideas...Any help?
Current threads: Western Colorado to LA and back gave a consistant 24 
mpg with the last 100 miles into CO @ 1.4 times the "suggested" limit, 
with the wife snoozing quietly ; )
Mine's a daily driver with 135k on the clock. I have a twice a week 
commute of 140 miles round trip, and this car has been as reliable as 
any of my vehicles, past and present.  
Tires for inclement weather...I run cheap Dunlop (D-40's I think) and I 
have no trouble (within reason) slapping the window ski rack on and 
heading for the slopes!
Pro'bly overstayed my welcome, so thanks for any help on the lights!

Nolan
