In a prior post, I mentioned tackling the nylon shifter bushing problem
in my 79.  As it turned out, the nylon had disappeared during the trip
to or from the paint shop (due to fact the engine was out of the car and
the torque tube was free to bounce around).  Anyway, my current fix is
to seat the socket over the ball and secure with two wires wrapped
around the torque tube.   This is not a good long-term fix.   After
reading the post a couple of days ago using very similar solution (ss
bands instead of wire) - it got me wondering why the fitting needs to be
so loose, e.g. with a ball/socket design?   I suppose due to the side to
side shifter motion since there is no fore/aft movement needed?   My
solution is working fine, but I'll get the correct nylon bushing and
take the exhaust back off and remove the heat shield and.........aw
cripes, I'm tired of it already!

Any thoughts why a 'permanent' hold down mechanism like the ss band or
wire wouldn't suffice?
