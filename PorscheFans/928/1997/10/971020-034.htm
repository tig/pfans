I have to agree with Paul 100%.  

I picked up my 1982, in pretty good shape with 100K miles on it, for 
$6000.  I immediately had $1000 worth of minor bodywork and 
painting done, and I'm in it another $1000 to $1500 for starter
motor, timing belt, plugs, wires, filters, hoses, headlights, stereo,
brake rotors and pads, etc.  I figure I'll be in it for under $10K when
I'm done...which still seems like a bargain to me.  

However, parts and mechanics time tends not to be financed like
the purchase is....so if a parts bill of $500 scares you, or if you
can't find another way to work for a couple of weeks at a time,
then maybe it's not 928 time for you yet.

I figure I've got another 2 months of little stuff going wrong before
it's a reliable daily driver.  I *COUNT ON* my 67 Chev pickup as
my daily driver till then.

On the insurance side, it's interesting that Farmer's Insurance
considers 1981 and 1982 928s as NOT high-performance (prev.
and later years ARE!), which cuts the rate in about half.  All 911s
are "high-performance".
