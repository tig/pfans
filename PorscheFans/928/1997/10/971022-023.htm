Hi all,

just thought I'd drop a note to describe my exploits today.
After stopping at a traffic light, I depressed the clutch
pedal to engage first. The pedal went hard to the floor
and stuck and first would not engage. Put on the blinkers
and shut off the engine. Started the car in first with
the starter and limped through heavy traffic to a 
nearby parking lot (at least it was an auto parts 
store :) )

Shut the car off and popped the hood (after pulling up the 
clutch pedal from the floor.) The brake/clutch fluid was
low. Took a peek underneath and saw fluid leaking from
the clutch inspect hole, the cap for the hole was 
gone.

Called the dealer and had it flat-bedded for service.
Will get call with estimate tomorrow (wish me luck
not breaking the bank.) 
Might have them do the 90K service while they have it
(at 87K now, was going to schedule for late Dec...)

Can anyone give me a W.A.G. estimate what the 
repair cost will be? Also, what exactly does
the 90K cover? (I lost my service book a while back)

Thanks and sorry this is rather long, but it isn't every day
the 928 leaves you stranded (thank goodness!)

David Schultz
