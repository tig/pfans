     I looked further into my own documentation and found a copy of the 
     original window sticker of my car.  Listed on the first line: 
     
     CODE       DESCRIPTION                     PRICE
     928040     MY 1991 PORSCHE 928GT COUPE     $64095
     
     Included in the list of options with $0 price (i.e. included with US 
     GT cars) are:
     
     G1G1       GUARDS RED                      $0
     VN         ALL LEATHER SEATS-BLACK         $0
     XD4        RIM CAP W/PORSCHE CREST         $162
     139        HEATED SEAT LEFT                $218
     158        RADIO "RENO"                    $0
     383        SPORT SEAT LEFT W/ELCT HGHT ADJ.$0
     387        SPORT SEAT RT W/ELCT HGHT ADJ.  $0
     418        BODY SIDE MOLDING               $0
     498        DELETE REAR MODEL DESIGNATION   $0
     570        INCREASED AIR CONDITIONING      $0
     650        ELECTRIC SUNROOF                $0
     
     This matches the option sticker under the carpet in the rear with 2 
     exceptions. This list includes CO2 (which I think means US 
     requirements) and XD9. Does anyone know what these 2 codes refer to?
     My car has a Blaupunkt-Stuttgart instead of the Reno. I wonder if this 
     is the XD9?
     
     I was also wondering if all GT's have Sport Seats? Sports seats are 
     usually an extra cost option, but these do not have the memory 
     feature. Maybe that makes them equal in cost or they are included in 
     the GT list price.
