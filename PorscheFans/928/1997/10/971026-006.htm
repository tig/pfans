The intent of this organization (whose name and organization are not yet in
place) would appear to be:

- to support owners of 928 cars in operating and maintaining their cars

- to encourage the widest array of enthusiast activities, including
technical, performance, and social, for 928 cars and their owners

- to assemble, rationalize, and disseminate the widest and best body of
information on the history, technology, maintenance, and modification of
928 cars

- to encourage businesses capable of repairing, modifying, or supplying
parts and accessories for 928 cars to recognize the size and enthusiasm of
the 928 market, and to make goods and services for that market

- to establish liaison with Porsche AG and Porsche Cars North America
concerning  parts availability, technical information, and the possible
revival of the 928 as a production car

The above is just my thoughts, and just in draft form. Any and all
suggestions are welcome.

A number of us are moving as we speak to pull this club together; now is
the time to express interest, offer services, and otherwise show the flag.
