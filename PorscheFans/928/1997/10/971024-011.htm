Did Porsche or any other car but Caddy ever use this 
technology?

Ever hear of retrofitting it to existing engines?

Would anyone else out there like to see a comeback of this 
technology?

The 4/6/8 engine that Eldos had in 81 have always interested 
me. Now we own one and indeed we enjoy it. We enjoy watching 
the number of active cylinders change on the dash display. 
It is just too cool to be cruising along level in that big 
16 year old car at 70 mph and look over at the mileage 
monitor and lo you have 4 shut down and you're at 21 mpg.

When in the 6 cylinder mode, the beat must be syncopated, 
because there is no way to space 6 evenly among 8. And you 
can feel that, once you learn to notice. But in 4, and of 
course 8, it is smooth. So, as you drive, you don't have to 
look at the dash to know how many you're on. If the engine 
isn't having to pull much, you are on 4. If you feel the 
cha-cha, 6. If you are pulling a serious hill or 
accelerating, 8. 

We like to set the cruise and look ahead and see how close 
we can come to guessing exactly where on the road it will 
switch.

Why did the technology die out?

We had heard persistent rumors that it was lemon technology, 
so before buying, we asked the master technician at two 
Caddy dealers and both said that some of the earliest ones 
of the year had bad sensors in their transmissions, but 
later ones were OK. In the earlier ones, some of the sensors 
in the transmissions would need replacements. And the 
replacements worked fine and essentially forever. Otherwise 
they were fine engines that lasted well. (The sensor tells 
the engine how many cylinders it needs.)

We've had ours and driven it regularly for more than a year 
and a half over some 20k miles with zero problems.

Also, the digital fuel injection is controlled by an early 
1980's computer chip, which even when new can not be tuned 
so that you get the expected Eldo perfectly undetectable 
idle. So, I can imagine the new owners taking them in to get 
the idle fixed only to be told no can do.

I guess the 4/6/8 feature got blamed for the unfixable idle, 
which wasn't its fault, and the technology died because of 
that and the early sensor troubles. 

Also, I guess there was little public understanding. One guy 
walked over to me at a gas station and announced that he had 
heard that when it was time to start the inactive cylinders, 
sometimes the starter would grind. 

Actually all it does is close both valves to shut down the 
respective cylinder. There is compression resistance. But 
after the piston crosses top dead center, the compressed gas 
gives back energy, as a gas spring, though there is some net 
energy loss due to compressive heating.

There is one solenoid over each of four of the cylinders, 
and corresponding bulges in the valve covers.

Further, I question introducing it on the Eldo, of all cars. 
The new-Eldo crowd cares least of all GM customers about 
mileage, unless it would be the limo buyers, I guess. If I 
had been a GM exec, I would have introduced it on a Chevy.

Any other theories?
