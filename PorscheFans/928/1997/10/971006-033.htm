Jim-san:

Don't feel bad, that's how I felt about that Stillen 300Z TT until I
thought about how
many extra goodies were in that car and whether it would make it to 80k
miles as gracefully as our cars.

Besides (he said hanging his head down in shame) I'm 'piloting' the
wife's Miata again
because the GT is Dead-ina-water AGAIN, this time with a worn plastic
shift cup.  I did
wait until the darkness of night to drive home but kept the top up so as
not to be
recognized.

So it's time I really start being proactive with this car and replace
the soft goods now.  I'll even give those SS brakes lines from NOPI a
try if they are DOT approved.  

Rufs may be nice but 928's Forever!
