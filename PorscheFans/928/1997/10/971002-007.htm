Hello all,   
Still in post Frenzy euphoric haze.  Again--good to meet you all.  
Gosh-a-rootie?    (hello Leonard) :) 
Kurt--option codes are listed on mine too.--- 220, 474 etc.
The designation for LSD on an 87' is the number 12 preceding the transmission
#. 
David, you are describing designations for 88' and 89' models? 
I guess I missed  Angel and his GT there Saturday. Who...Which car? (sorry
Angel)
I just pieced together the fact that Larry Reynolds who was there detailing
on Stephanes' car Saturday, must be the same guy I've seen on the car care
web sites
(rain on the way home blended the shiny spots back in, didn't it Stephane?) 
Frenzy tech session got me looking at my car yesterday and today.
Checked front wheel bearings today...a little loose...re-packed and adjusted.
Manuals specify Shell Retinax A for the wheel bearing
grease....(Stephane--was 
that you asking about this recently?) Looked everywhere....called Shell
distributor....
There is no such thing as a Retinax A. There are 4 types of this Retinax
grease, but no A. Go figure. Well, to make a long story short, I used a high
quality wheel bearing grease that he confidently suggested. 

Also checked my ride heights....right at the low side of the tolerances. 
This brings up another thing....The Tech. Spec. Book and the Manuals differ
in the front height specification.
One says 190mm and the other says 180mm. Go figure again! Also, hard to tell
in the T.S.B. if they mean plus or minus on their tolerances or not. 
Yes, the 928 is a real Deutsche Treat and Tutonic Tour-de-Force, but these
wacky 
Germans make better Panzers and Porsches than they do Spec Books and Shop
Manuals. (I guess something just gets lost in the translation)

Regards,
Greg Schickel   87'  5spd.  Diamantblau Metallic
