I have been reading this mail for a while now and thought i'd finally =
write in.
I recently purchased my 1990GT, Guards Red/Black, 56K from a BMW dealer =
here in town.

I'd like to thank Phil Tong for his helping me make the decision to buy =
the car.
The dealer was advertising the car as an S4, i had a hunch it was a GT =
and Phil and his web page helped me determine its authenticity, as a GT. =
=20

Since the BMW dealer was associated with a Porsche dealer in town, i was =
able to get a Porsche preferred one year warranty worked in the deal.
The warranty is pretty thorough and i guess i'll be going to the dealer =
for some time -that is, if i have problems. :^)

I have enjoyed this mailing list (especially the road-kill).  Several of =
you have mentioned your low mileage cars and i was wondering if anyone =
had a story about a "high mileage car" or old faithful.

Also- i have a clicking sound when i open my drivers side door.
Someone told me it was the guide inside.  Passengers side is quiet.
Any tips on how i can fix this somewhat annoying problem?

thanks in advance......
