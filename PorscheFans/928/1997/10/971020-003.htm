Paul,
This doesn't sound normal at all in my experience with 928s. Although I have
heard a few others with similar stories, I have never experienced this in any of
the 928s that I have owned or worked on.

For example my 79 Euro can be jacked up at the front drivers side jack point
until both left tires are off of the ground, at this point even then doors, hood
and hatch open and close fine. This seems to be the norm in my experience.
Since your 928 is an 85, I would be suspicious of some type of previous frame
damage or some very, very heavy track use. (I think Marc Reviel eluded to this
phenomenon on his 928 that had seen heavy track use, Mark pardon me if I have
the wrong person)
 If you plan on using the car to its limits I would have it checked out by a
good chassis man that you can trust, maybe someone on the list can give you some
recommendations in your area.
