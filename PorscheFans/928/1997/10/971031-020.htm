Alan asked:

> Safety equip?

Caused me to drag out the PCA "Guidelines for Autocross, Rally & Track,
Second ed." to look up the requirements for autocross:

Driver
 Valid state drivers' license
 18 years or older
Car Preparation
 1. 356 cars should have zero to neg camber in rear
 2. pre 1959 356 cars should have late model spindles
 3. Wheels on tight w/no visible cracks.  Lug nuts on and properly
engaged & torqued.
 4. Hubcaps, wheel covers, trim rings off.
 5. No excessive brake pedal fade.
 6. No excessive wheel bearing play.
 7. Mufflers must meet local noise restrictions.
 8. Tires must have safe tread, no sidewall damage, proper inflation.
 9. No fluid leaks.
 10. Adequate seat belts. Sepcial req. for aftermarket belts.
 11. Throttle linkage and/or cables must be safe w/adequate return
spring tension. Dual throttle return springs recommended.
 12. Batteries held in place securely.
 13. Gas cap attached securely.
 14. No loose objects in passenger compartment or trunk.
 15. A shoulder harness may be used in a hard top car, or in an open car
if equiped with an adequate rollbar.
 16. Roll bars stringly recommended for all open cars.
 17. Sunroofs must be closed. Recommend 900 series cars participate with
removeable tops in place or closed.
Driver Safety
1.  Should wear long-sleeve shirts and pants of non-synthetic material.
Shoes must be worn and should have no heels and be flexible.
2.  Each driver must wear an approved helmet.  (Loaner helmets must also
be approved).

What is not mentioned in the booklet is the specific type of helmet. The
Track Events section suggests a fully closed helmet with a Snell
Motorsports approved rating.  I know someone who uses a motorcycle
helmet with a Snell M95 rating which only cost hin $120.  He says this
is OK for rally and autocross and that is old helmet with a Snell 87
rating was not OK. I'm also told that there may be different
requirements for SCCA, POC, and PCA high-speed events.

BTW, I'm told there will be a PCA Drivers Education event at Sears Point
in late Nov/early Dec.  This costs money (around $100, I think) but is a
chance to really try out our cars on a real road coarse under high-speed
conditions.  I'll try to find out more about this planned event.  It
might be nice to see some 928s there.
