I've noticed the questions concerning leather soffening and there is
something you've got to try.  It's called Soffener, is made by Color
Plus and is sold by Car Care Specialties for $10 phone 201-796-8300. 
The business is owned by Larry Reynolds and you can see his ad in
Panorama, The Star (Mercedes club) and Roundel (BMW).  He has a catalog
of 1000's of detailing products from around the world and has personally
tested every one on his own cars.  He will try to steer you toward the
least expensive ones (if they are as effective as the best).  I sent him
a sunvisor once and he perfectly matched the color in a dye/refinish
system.  He has turned me on to the primo wash, polish, wax,
interior/exterior plastic and rubber preservatives.  I've been greatful
because there is a lot of misinformation out there!  You'll notice he
recommends the same products as John Paterek, Porsche club authority on
these matters.  Sorry for the long winded message.
