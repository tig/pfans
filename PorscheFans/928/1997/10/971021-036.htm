Alan,
There are exceptions to this rule if the buyer has competent knowledge of 928s
and can fix, repair or replace almost anything on the car.

Example: I bought a 79 Euro for $1500, put 3 weeks of afternoons and weekends of
my time, plus another $3-4 in used late model parts and created one the most
reliable and strong 928s I have ever owned. It is now my daily driver and I
would not hesitate to go anywhere in the country in it.

Ask anyone who saw my 79 Euro at the VA Frenzy, better yet, ask Lucky Ekman who
was dying to drive it and did (very hard I might add) and was impressed, plus 3
other people who took it for a spin (literally).

Granted it does have a few paint flakes on the front bumper cover and a scratch
here and there, but no one believes me when I tell them it is a 79, they say it
looks to good.
Quite frankly because it is not a perfect flawless car I can have much more fun
with it because it can take a few bumps and knocks without tears streaming down
my face.(unlike my 89)
