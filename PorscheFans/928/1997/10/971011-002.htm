Here in rice-rocket territory in southern California,  kids are spending
absolutely amazing amounts of money to get their Hondas and Acuras to go
quickly to maybe 80.  Some are blazingly quick too, so choosing off with one
at a light may or may not be a good idea.  Since the main strength of the
928 is at higher sppeds,  I try to ignore the little guys.  Don't want to be
embarassed by someone who has more in their Honda than I have in the 928.

That leads us smoothly to a second point-- Now that I have one, it would be
cool if the prices went up commensurate with the value.  I paid less for my
'89 with 22k on it than my secretary just shelled out for her new Accord.
There's enough difference to cover 50k of scheduled maintenance on the 928,
too.  Why aren't those rich honda-kids thinking along the lines of a 'real'
performance car?  They haven't been to the "value" classes at the junior
college yet I guess...

>I was driving on the toll way today in my black 928S4 when I stopped at a
>toll booth. I deposited my change into the basket, the arm at the booth
>raised, and I began to drive off at a normal pace. After having driven just
>a few feet I noticed a guy on my left, who was also just pulling out of the
>next toll booth, in a Honda CRX. He glanced over, and then floored it.
