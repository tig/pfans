Dear Jim Foley
	If you like the car, if it feels right for you go for it. 15k for a low mi 
car in great condition, Just doit.

Until the purchase of my 1986.5 928s my daily was my 1987 944 (Great fun car), 
but now I drive the 928 daily.
Southern California Orange County (freeways)

Purchased in June 1997.

Car		Cost
1986,5 928s	9,800	Guards Red (Outside A- , Inside A- , Mech A) 78k 
Windshield	   600	Installed
Plug Wires	   300	Installed (included oil change)
Tires		   400	Installed Dunlop D40 M2 
Washer Motor	   300	installed (included oil change)
Turn signal cont	   200	installed (turn signal, wiper, cruise control) New 
160, used 90

Total		11,600

Outstanding problems :

Right wheel bearing suspect

I found the car on the internet, much to my surprise the PO lives 3 blocks 
away.
I was not really looking for a new car but more speed out of the 944 at the 
time.
I guess I just got lucky, I still drive the 944 it's a different animal point 
and shoot (as someone else said).

Jim buy whatever makes you happy not what the S4 aero heads think.
