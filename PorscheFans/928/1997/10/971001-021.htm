Hi all:

I feel only slightly more comfortable after reading this.  Again, I had
practically no time to react the pedal just sank, and the resevoir was empty
as far as I could see / feel.   Frank is pretty hip though and this did not
bother him to fire it up in 1st and idle into the shop with the parking brake
I assume doing the major stopping.

Still freaked over this though and don't want to find out the stopping power
at 100+ mph with no fluid!  Just imagining this happened at the drag strip or
....  Ok, I better stop now (and will).
Phil
