Hello Shark Fans,

My '87 S4 5spd (62K miles) is experiencing its first chilly weather under 
my care here in New York, and I'm starting to see a behavior the PO warned 
me about:  The transmission is very hard to engage when its cold.  I manage 
to drive through some combination of forcing, wiggling, and sometimes 
starting in 2nd, and after a few minutes things seem to warm up and get back 
to normal.  

Probably coincidentally, a leaking transmission input shaft seal was
replaced about a month ago.  The folks who did the work (the excellent
Autosport Designs, thanks for the pointer LL) said that the transmission
was in good condition, and I got fresh oil with the work.

Is this normal?  Do you other 5spd owners live with this in cool but 
above-freezing weather?  Any tips on shifting when it's cold?

Thanks,

Phil Wilson (pgw@boerum.com)
