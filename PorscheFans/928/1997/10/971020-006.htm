Chris,
First off, if you are looking for a cheap car that is reliable get an old
Toyota. :-)

If you are looking for a premier GT Sports Car, and you are willing to spend the
money to do the proper maintenance and upkeep  double your $4k to $8K and buy an
early 928, but have a reserve of another $1-2k for initial pre-maintenance.

If you are looking for a low cost Porsche, the 944 is the way to go, however you
will run into almost the same type of maintenance costs of the 928 (timing belt
, water pump, etc),

Concerning the handling issues, that will probably be debated forever ( I much
prefer the 928, solid as a rock). Quite frankly I feel that both the 928 and
944s handling limits are way beyond the average drivers abilities anyway, so it
is not that much of an issue.

A word of advice, don't buy a Porsche as a status symbol, buy it to take care of
and enjoy it's capabilities. If you do that, every time you slip behind the
wheel you will feel that "special something" that comes with the ownership of
such a fine sports car.

P.S. Go drive a good used 944 and then a good used 928, you will know which is
right for you.
