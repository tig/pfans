I suppose anything is possible, but I tend to doubt that a "nice" 928 can be
had for the price range indicated. Really, if that's all you can afford to
spend, you should consider something else. Consider what the 928 sold for
when new and if you still think the price should be around $4,000 to $6,000
wake up. Also, if you do find one for that price, do you have a clue as to
how much will it cost to get it back into decent shape?

Don't get me wrong, there are good deals on 928s out there. You will have to
do some homework and invest some time in the search. However, I think it's a
bit much to expect to find a nice 928 for unreasonably low prices. From my
experience with 928 owners, I get the impression that they are (in general)
nice, smart, and savy. It is unlikely that they would just about give away
what they know to be a good thing.

As far as extremely high cars, what is your meaning of "extremely high"? A
well maintained 928 engine should last to 300,000 miles or more. So if the
mileage is in the 100,000 to 200,000 it still has about half of its expected
usable life.

Good luck (you'll need it) and happy motoring. Ed
