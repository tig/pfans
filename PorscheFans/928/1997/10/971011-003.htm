Dave:

Watch the weather reports carefully.  Todays forecast in the Sierras (a ways
west of SLC) has winter storm warnings posted for the next day or two.  That
means that you'll be driving through this storm as it passes you later in
the week.  As several have documented here recently,  sharks don't swim so
good in snow.

Otherwise, have a wonderful trip.  With clear roads and a dusting of snow on
the slopes, the run through the Rockies and the Wasatch should be
spectacular.  I dashed west out of Denver a month ago in my then-new car,
and wished just a bit that there was some snow on the mountains.  The north
route through Wyoming should be at least as good.

If you have a chance,  you can try your car at its maximum safe driving
speed in Montana on the way.  ...And make sure those snow tires are
balanced... =8-)

Drive safe!
