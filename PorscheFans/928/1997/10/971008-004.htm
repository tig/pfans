I am a brand new neurotic owner of a white '88 s4 thanks to the help of
Brian Buxton who has been diligent, honest, and extremely helpful.  Thank=
s
Brian.  I  recommend that anyone interested in buying a dream machine cal=
l
him first as he has enlightened me on a lot of things and has really help=
ed
out in getting my dream started.  On another note,..  What kind of gas ar=
e
you all using?  does it matter whether it's Chevron, ARCO, or Shell?  My
mechanic told me to only use Chevron on my wife's 750il but I did not kno=
w
if that goes over to 928's as well.  The BMW group suggest using regular
instead of premium in moderate climates because it burns better in the 12=

cylinder engine.  My 928 owners manual says only use premium.  What do yo=
u
guys think?  My "new" car has 77k,  new waterpump,timing belt, cap &
rotors, all new fluids, and absolutley screams down the road.  Are there
any major engine precautions I should be aware of? Suspension issues?  I
read something about aluminum ball joints in a previous thread but do not=

know if it applies to an '88 s4. I am also looking for the protective pan=
s
that fit under the engine from the front spoiler to the cat but cannot ge=
t
any good pricing on used parts.  Either they are non-existent, or they wa=
nt
scary amounts of money for a tin part.  Is it ok to drive without them? =

I've appreciated this group for more than 3 months when I first started
looking for a car and it was here that I picked up Brians name & number. =

After getting the runaround from hucksters here in the Bay Area,  it is
good to know we have Leonard Laub, Phil Tong, etc.. to gain wisdom. =

Looking forward to your replies.  =
