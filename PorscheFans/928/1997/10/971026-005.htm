What alternatives would you recommend.>>

Since your car is a 5-spd I'd say that you will experience a SERIOUS
improvement over what I experienced with my auto (and my improvements were
very noticeable).  The car shifts harder and crisper when under full
throttle, gets better fuel economy, has much more low end torque (which
improves in town drive ability), and revs higher & faster.  The chips just
improve the responsiveness and power of an already great engine.  The 1987S4
auto that I have for sale right now is in perfect mechanical condition, is
totally stock, and is not nearly as fast as my 87S4 auto w/ K&N, Bursch
test-pipe and AutoThority chips.  Definitely a good investment.
