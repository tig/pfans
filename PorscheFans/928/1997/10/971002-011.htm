Phil:

My 83 928s has a warning light that indicates that the pressure on the
brake system is low. This warning light is different than the warning that
indicates,
for example, used brake pads. In the brake pads case the warning light will
illuminate continuously  when you turn the car on and can be turned off by
pushing
a button  in the center console (button with exclamation mark).  The low
brake pressure warning is a flashing light that will not go off when you
push the
above mentioned button.  I imagine that Porsche did this so we don't ignore
a very serious problem.  The brake pressure warning lit on my car after I
washed
the chassis and engine.  Luckily it was a wet sensor, but I got pretty scared.
To reset this warning I dried the sensor and disconnected the battery and the
 problem up to now has been solved.

My question is, why didn't this warning go onto effect when you lost
fluid?  It is probable (I hope) that you never lost brake fluid pressure.
Are your sensors operating?

Any comments from the enlightened 928 list?

Did I reset the warning light in the right way?
