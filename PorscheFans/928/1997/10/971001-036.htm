Fellow Fans,

I thought you might be interested in this.  Tonight I dove into my new
oil leak, and after taking the fan, belts, oil tube, and TB cover off, I
still could not find an obvious leak source (ie fresh oil leak trail). 
I poked around for about 15 minutes or so and decided to look at the
front of the engine from under the nose.  The oil streamed back along
the pan, with some oil being splashed by the fan and the Timing Belt.
I thought about taking the balance pully off but decided to check the
tightness of the pan bolts.  Lo-an-behold!!  Finger tight, or loose for
that matter!  Almost everyone of them.

I think the 14 hour drive to the Frenzy may have been enough to loosen
the front bolts so the oil could squeeze out under the high forces of
braking and cornering at last Sunday's autocross.  

Now I need to clean up the oil, take the bolts out and re-install with
loctite.  Does anyone know what has to be dropped to do this job without
pulling the engine?  I did this job three years ago, but I pulled the
engine to replace all the seals and four broken exhaust studs.

I'll start dropping the pan tomorrow.  But, I'll check my e-mail first!!
