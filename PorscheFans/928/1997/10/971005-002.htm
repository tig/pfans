>>I am looking for info on a Piper Ski Rack.  I have one for my 944, but I
would like to know if they ever made one for the 928.  I guess what I
would also like to know is if the company is still around.  The tag says
Foster City, CA; but that is all that I have found on them.  If Piper
does not make a ski rack for the 928, what have you alpine skiers used
with success?

While I am not familiar with the Piper Ski Rack, I know that Porsche used to
offer a rack for the 928 (at least in Germany). The part number was 928 801
055 02. Price was DM 580 - approx. $ 400. However, I don't know if this is
still available.

I assume this did not include the actual ski, bike or surfboard mounts, that
were offered separately. For skis it was part number 996 801 091 00 for DM 98
- approx. $ 60. 

If you can't find the Piper ski rack, you might try harassing your Porsche
dealer with the above part numbers....

Good luck!
