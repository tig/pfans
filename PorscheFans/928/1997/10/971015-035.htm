Just thought I would share this with the list.  It was instructive.  I am
impressed with the descriptions.  Kudos to David Roberts for being the first
with an answer to my "what the hell ..." questions.  He even beat you
Leonard.  But, the reply below goes one step further than telling me what it
is.  Enjoy the passage.

<<Brian,

It's one you won't see in the US, but if you have a look in the book
"Porsche 928 Performance Portfolio" there's the only article I have ever
seen on it.

Basically they did a British market limited production run in 1988 of about
150 cars.  It is effectively the Club Sport with some of the luxury gear
back in and the S4 engine with an uprated engine management system and cams
and exhaust. It's VERY firmly sprung, 5 spd manual and the road test puts
0-60mph at 5.3 sec, 0-100mph at 12.7 sec and 175mph top speed.  I found it
for sale in a little country town here in NZ and the guy didn't know it was
something special.  It was hard to get information on it, but now that I
have a copy of the original invoice from Porsche I have confirmed it's
genuine.

Here's some stuff from the article in the book:

" The original 928S which charmed the worlds motoring press at the beginning
of the decade is but a distant relation to this red-raw SE. You wouldn't
want to tackle 500 miles of autobahn in this car. It would be too tiring.
Think of a Shelby Mustang with handling, brakes and superb build quality,
however, and you are getting closer to the mark...

.....There's nothing about the hollow, slightly guttural timbre of the
burbling engine not at tickover to warn the unsuspecting of what lies in
wait. At rest, or trickling around town, this Porsche is docility
personified. Progress is smooth, well damped and almost anti-climactic. Feed
the power in gently and the SE responds in kind, wafting forwards with
almost benign indifference...

.....Take to the open road, though, and it is a dramatically different story.
All the ease and effortlessness experienced drifting through the suburbs
suddenly vanishes like a pleasant daydream. To move fast in the SE requires
a mental as well as a physical change of gear. If your intention is to feel
the carpet with your right foot then you had better tense your neck muscles
in preparation. If you don't, then giving the SE its head means losing yours
to gravity. Heavy acceleration equals G force, it's as simple as that. The
big car growls, grabs the horizon by the collar and hauls it in. In real
terms, it's quicker than a 911 turbo and, this side of an F40 or a 959, you
don't get much quicker than that. The ordinary S4 feels tame by comparison."

It gave me goosebumps the first time I read it!  

Regards,

Philip>>
