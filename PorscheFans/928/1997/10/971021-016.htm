Find the stamp on the engine with the engine serial number and engine type.
From the look of your plenum, you have the pre-S4 32-valve engine (the S4
plenum has a black cap over the cute flapper valve which changes the tuning
of the intake rams as engine speed changes, part of how it gets more
performance than the prior version).

There were several flavors of 32V 928 engine sold in '85 or '86. The M
28.43 whose specs I just posted went to the US. The M 28.44 went with auto
cars to US and Japan. The slightly less powerful M 28.45 and M 28.46 went
with stick and auto cars to Australia. Cars for Europe had 16-valve
engines, M 28.21 (as previously posted) for stick and M 28.22 for auto
(Swiss cars have the same engine designation but 35 bhp less).

You'll see this engine type designation in the stamp (as "M28/xx") along
with the serial number, which will run '81Gxxxxx" for a US '86 and
"82Gxxxxx" for a non-US '86.

Please let us know what you do find.
