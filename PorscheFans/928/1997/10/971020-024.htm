Greetings:

Question, has anyone encountered this problem:

I have an 82 928, 3 sp auto, 56K, runs great, except it will not pull
above 4300 RPM in 3rd gear, or its equivalent of about 5700 in 2nd gear.
As I rarely get a chance to run this fast I was not aware of the problem
(Denver traffic is horrible at all hours that I am out). The car acts
like one that has reached its top speed, but this is only about 110 mph
(85 mph speedo). The manual says that the auto should go 140, about 5500
RPM in 3rd which is logical as the peak torque is at 4000 RPM and peak
horsepower at 5500 RPM.

The car has a new Borla exhaust and K&N air filter so flow should not be
the problem. The engine idles smooth and runs strong in first gear (till
5500 RPM). There is not indication of bucking or missing at the higher
speeds, it just won't go. 

Thanks,

Dave.
