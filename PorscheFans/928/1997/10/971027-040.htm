Awhile ago, there was considerable thread concerning refinishing the
black anodized coating on trim pieces (black).  As I recall, most
responses were not positive and an alternative was to purchase new trim
pieces.   For a show quality or perfect repair, as always, new pieces
are the ultimate solution.

Several weeks ago, I asked if anyone had any experience with Wurth's
advertised 'Trim Paint' and got no response.   I've since purchased the
product and used it on the back glass trim as well as the windshield
pieces.   It looks terrific and was easy to use.  I cannot testify to
long-term service at this point.   It is their part number 8930190 and
sells for $5.95 for a 15 oz spray can.

Another product I snagged from them is the 'Silicone Lubricating
Compound' for $14.95 in an 8 oz tube.   It is designed for brake parts,
O-rings, and weatherstrip type parts. Excellent stuff.

I have no affiliation at all with Wurth, but these products (as all
Wurth products) are as good or better than anything I've found in 20
years of car restoration - hacking in a garage.

Finally.......a call for HELP.   I'm about 75% reassembled at this
point.   I've gotten the aluminum trim pieces around the window
installed.   How do you get the weather strips installed to back into
the black aluminum trim?   There is a samll rubber bead that fits into
the groove around the window, and I'm out of patience trying to squeeze
that bead into the groove - HEEEEEEEELP!

Thanks for any response....
