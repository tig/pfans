I, too, am having trouble staying on the list.   Over past two weeks,
I've gotten about four actual posts - forced to go to the website and
scour the archives at this point.

Someone asked about rear speaker replacement in his 79 model.   Just
last night I installed one side and tonight will complete the job.   I
searched everywhere and could not find an aftermarket unit with
appropriate depth and bolt configuration.   I resorted to Sony 4X5s that
are made particulary shallow.   I still had to cut a hole in the quarter
(I know, I know......didn't wanna, but had to......) to mount the
speaker.  As you know, the quarter trim fits over that clip creating a
gap - enough that the speakers I bought will fit in there acceptably.
Of course, I'm rebuilding a driver, as this would not be acceptable for
show or if you simply MUST stay stock.

Good luck in your search!
