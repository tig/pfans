---------------------------
This is a great way to approach the subject. I agree almost completely with
you on all these points. However, it must be pointed out that there are
occasions of failure with the 928 that are stunningly expensive.

1.) the air conditioning hose that routes through the firewall. This does
fail, and the book rate is 5.5 hours to R&R. And of course, the hose is
expensive as hell.

2.) early lower ball joints fail completely and spectacularly, dropping the
car to the ground. Preventative upgrades are pricey, but pale in comparison
to dealing with failure.

3. torque converter rivets on  automatic transmissions come loose and must
be replaced. The rivets are cheap, but the tranmission is mounted in such a
way that R&R is 10 hours.

4. front shocks are about $400 a set, and replacing them is a major job
that can run nearly $400 if you're in a high labor rate area.

There may be ways shadetree mechanics can end-run many 928 problems with
bailing wire and VW parts, but these examples, to my knowledge, need to be
fixed with real Porsche parts. (Unless you're local to Southern California,
where Performance Aire can fix the A/C problem in-car)

------------------------
Well, I've used the analogy of XKE Jags before. While some may contend that
928s are not expensive to maintain, I think most of us can agree that
'deferred maintenance' is hideously expensive. Most cheap 928s are cheap
because of deferred maintenance. Unfortunately, that pulls down the prices
of well-maintained cars, too. I've known two people who bought complete,
good-running S4s for under $7,000 **3-4 years ago**. Prices have fallen
since. So 928s are generally a bargain--assuming they have been maintained.


Turning this price trend around is gonna be tough. As I've posted here
before, when somebody advertises their well-cared-for 928 at a top-market
price, it's self-defeating for the peanut gallery to jump in with 'your car
should sell for $3,000 less' posts. That's how newsgroups self-destruct.

If we're here to support the 928, then let's support it.
