Well, as much as I fear the flames I will receive for various parts of
this post I feel the need to express my joy with my '86 928S 5spd (now
two months old - well, for me anyway)

Drove 1648 miles in 22 hours (that includes all pit stops) from Dayton
Ohio to Salt Lake City a week ago. What a car! I didn't plan on doing
the whole trip in one sitting, but the car rides so well that I just
kept saying, "I'm not real tired yet, I'll just go another hour" and
next thing I knew, I was there!

So when in Salt Lake . . . yes I took the 928 to and on the Salt Flats.
I have many pictures and some camcorder footage that I'm working on
converting to PC format of some kind, email me if you would like copies
(dmo1205@ix.netcom.com).

Let me tell you, there is no bigger rush I've experienced than flying
along at 150+ across the wide open flats speedway (80 feet wide 10 miles
long), that is until my friend drove it and I was manning the
camcorder.  Out on the flats early on Sunday morning, not a sound, then
the 928 comes by at 145+ 25 feet away! Hard to verbalize, ask for the
video with stereo sound and you'll get the idea.

Of course, time and gas supply was working against us, but the return
trip from the flats to the city (about 100 miles) at 110+ was a rush as
well(and unless you've driven this road don't flame me for reckless
driving)

A few days later (and about $25 in quarters at the car wash) I drove the
1648 miles back in 21 hours (construction had opened up in Nebraska).

Observations from the 4000 miles I put on in 5 days:

The car is a rock at high speeds! Semi trailers where at about a 30
degree lean across Nebraska and I felt nothing! I averaged 22 mpg for
the entire 4000 miles, that includes the many high speed runs on the
flats. Nothing broke or needed attention other than refueling and
washing. I love this car!!!!!

On a sad note, I only saw one other Porsche the entire 4000 miles and
that was a 944 (that did wave) outside Des Moines.

But I did notice that my gas gauge needle will not go all the way to the
top when full (and yes it was full as I put in 22 gallons at one
stop)nor will it drop below the orange light section when nearing empty.
The manuals say that there is suppose to be only 2-3 gallons when the
light comes on but I usually have about 5-6. Is there a way to adjust?

Also with all the tire talk, I have Goodyear Eagle F1s and have almost
10,000 miles on them with no signs of wear at all. I'm running the
recommended 36f/44r pressure and have not had an alignment done since
taking ownership.

Long live the 928!

site please let me know!
