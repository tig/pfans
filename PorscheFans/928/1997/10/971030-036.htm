Ok Dad - that's great incentive.  He is a fine son and here's hoping he
attains the grade!  Study young grasshopper - there is no substitute!

Cool!  Thanks for the directions.  Though I hope *NOT* to repeat my
first performance, make sure you limber up before working the corners
during my runs!!!  

I have a spare medium Arai that might fit you, should I bring it?

Bert Delvillano (sp?) I think he's the GGR AX chair?  I need to read the
GGR newsletter again.  I may be getting people mixed up with LPR.  If
the class that we'll run is later in the day that's better for me since
I am not an AM kinda' person!  So you know which shift I'd like in a 24
hour race :)

See ya there!
