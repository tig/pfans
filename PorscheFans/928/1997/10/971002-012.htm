 This test certainly worked the first time I let my girlfriend drive my car. We
 were coming home from a long weekend at my cabin in Wisconsin. After stopping
 for a bit of lunch, she offered to drive the rest of the way home. Traffic was
 fairly heavy on the highway, so she turned right out of the parking lot rather 
 aggressively....and slid the car smoothly sideways into the left lane :) Sure 
 glad the 928 is fast and the lane was clear!
