One thing I often do is to put the wheels under the car after I take them off.  If
it would fall, the wheels would almost certainly keep the car from killing me (and
I've got a small garage so you have to put them somewhere).  It's more important to
do  this when you're alone in the garage (and nobody would ever know if the thing
fell).  Also, don't store the jack under the car while it's on stands - if it does
fall and someone does hear your screams, it won't matter if they can't get to the
jack!

As you know, NEVER NEVER NEVER go under w/o stands (I think you even get a penalty
in NASCAR for this).
