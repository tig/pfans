P-fans,

Before my hard drive crashed a few weeks ago I had a site book marked that
was totally awesome for finding used cars.  I thought it was Classifieds 2000
or something like that, but I can't seem to find it again.  This site had
several hundred 928's listed almost all the time from all years and all
places.  Please email me the proper net address if anyone else has found this
place or some other good used car address.

Also, if anyone has seen or knows of a Riviera or Meritime Blue GTS (both
these blue colors are very close to the solid [non-metallic] Mazda Miata
blue) then let me know.  I am considering one but I need an auto and am
really only interested in one of those two colors.

TIA,
James Morrison
