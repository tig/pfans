Two weeks back, we (CVR) had 2 driver's ed days at Lime Rock (LRP).  I
was there Sat. only along with Mark DaVia and new list member David
Lloyd was there Thur (NNJR) and Fri. representing the big waterpumpers.
Beautiful day - blue sky and fall foliage - whole family had a great
time!  My wife brought her stopwatch along so we could see the effect of
some different lines.  What we learned was the importance of track
and/or tire temps!  The last time I was at LRP was the first time
anybody ever timed me and I did 2 1:08.??'s in a row.  The first session
we were just taking it really easy - we also had a car with a mechanical
so we ended up spending a bit of our time in the pits waiting for it to
be moved.  In the second session I added some speed but was still being
conservative.  I figured I was running 1:09's and so was a more than a
bit surprised when my wife showed me 4 laps in a row at 1:07.01,
1:07.04, 1:07.83 (caught a 911), and 1:07.28.  Looking over all the
laps, there were 2 in the 1:06's - 3s faster than I thought!  We had a
great day!

Mark has run quite a bit @ LRP but this was his first time with PCA.  He
was therefore appropriately "punished" (for not running with PCA) and
put in the green run group.  This is some real punishment as Mark was
running 1:07's the last time he was there (green might typically lap at
1:20 with a very wide spread).  Mark's day was less good as a radiator
hose ruptured but he did get in 2 good laps so that the instructor
signed him off to run solo.

Now the point of the posting:
For the above, we mounted a camcorder in the cargo area.  The shots were
simply amazing - I think it looks really peaceful but then again you're
closing on another car at 10 mph through the diving turn entering over
90, exiting at 100 mph, and you can hear the R1's protesting through the
turn!  I did OK representing the 928's again - again more "I didn't know
those could go that fast.".  It was my first time running with CVR and
they put me in white which I was a bit nervous about as CVR has a
reputation for being very fast at LRP.  After the first run, it was
pretty clear I had no reason to be insecure about my placement in the
white group and we had a really good time - everyone was really polite
in waving by.  It wasn't until I watched the tape at home that I
realized that only 1 car passed us all day - a 944Turbo that was running
A TON of boost as evinced by the huge, HUGE, HUGE puff of smoke when he
upshifted (he was driving more effectively too).

I didn't want to drill holes in the car to mount the camera.  I used the
2 inboard rear backrest seat bold in the cargo area - just behind the
center console.  I used 3/4" copper tubing flattened the ends in a vise
and then carefully bent them to the proper angles to make a tripod.  The
third leg of the tripod was clamped to the rear metal clip for the spare
tire cover (removed) using 2 aluminum (of course) plates.  Where the
tree tubes meet, I bolted on a 1" aluminum cube with a tapped hole and
then drilled a through hole for the bolt to the camera.  Super solid - I
think you could almost tow the car with it.  I made it so that the front
of the camera was behind the rear backrest (where my daughter rides) and
just above (at the same elevation as the rear wing so I don't loose any
rear view).
For autocrosses (more interesting steering inputs than the track), it
didn't vibrate but under hard cornering and braking at the track it
vibrated.  This is because the camera part of the tripod mount wasn't
stiff enough.  I'll add a 1/4" thick plate so that the camera has a
larger bearing surface and that should certainly fix the problem.  If
you want to leave the rear cargo area carpet in place, you might be able
to use a mounting point under the tool kit cover for the rear tripod leg
- one could also just get a small piece of carpet from an upholstery
shop for very few $ and save the original for when the tripod isn't in
place.  There are many personal taste issues here - this is a safe
solution that works for us.

On safety issues.  One is to have an auxiliary strap to tie the camera
to the tripod as any large impact will rip the plastic tripod mount
right off the camera leaving you with a 100 mph 2 lb projectile in your
car.  Lessening the camcorder weight is better and one important (and
convenient) thing here is to do away with the heavy rechargeable battery
and to power the camcorder off the car's 12 V.  Mine wanted about 6.7 V
so I used a LM317 adjustable voltage reg mounted in a cast aluminum box
and then use a metal hose clamp to attach to the tripod.  The camera
draws about 1 A so this will be dissipating about 6 W and so you need a
little bit of a heat sink.  For power, I tied into the wiper motor
wiring with some quick splicers and mating plugs so that it can be
removed (and disconnected when not in use).

DISCLAIMER:  Most people don't build roll bars out of copper tubing -
you should use mild or chromolly steel for the camera mount.  If you use
copper and it breaks and injures you, don't sue me 'cause I didn't tell
you to use it!

A funny "we're so misunderstood" 928 thing at LRP on Sat:
I got the advice to pick up an extra toe hook and to install both so
that the car could easily be toed in the event of an OTE (off-track
excursion).  Mark DaVia noticed this on my car and I passed on the
advice to him and he decided to put his toe hook in the rear mounting
point.  On Sat, I went through the tech inspection first and then 20 min
or so later Mark did.  As they were finishing him, Mark overheard a
conversation between 2 tech inspectors:
"Do all the 928's come with toe hooks?"
Other tech inspector, "No, they just screw in."

One of the things the video camera did was to clearly document me
getting a black flag for passing in the braking area into big bend as
well as the resulting driver consultation.
From the tape:
"Do you know why we black flagged you?"
"I think I was too late."
"WAY too late."
....<snip> ...
"Go out and have a good time but watch the late passes."

Ooops!  (I was very grateful - they were easy on me.)  It wasn't a
dangerous pass (IMO) but it did clearly violate the rules that are there
to try to insure safety.

Best,
Kurt
