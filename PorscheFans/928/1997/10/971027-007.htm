Hi 928 fans!

Is there a high quality replacement set of seat covers out there for our
cars?  I saw one company advertising in Hemmings, and will probably call
them.  I just wondered if any of you have used them, or any other pre-made
sets, and are they decent?  trying to find a good upholstery shop here in
Albuquerque is , well, there isnt one.
 
My wife discovered the new car yesterday, darn her.  I was hoping I could get
rid of the 79 and she would never know the difference, since they are both
white and look almost identical. At least I didnt have to sleep in it last
night! However, she isnt too crazy about the checkerboard seats in the 81. (
I kinda like them! )

Thanks for your help!
