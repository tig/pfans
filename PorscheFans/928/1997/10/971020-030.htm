Todd,

  Based on what I see advertised in Austin, $9900 seems like a reasonable
  price for a well maintained example.  There is currently a 1-owner '86 
  for sale here with the same specs but with 76K miles and an asking price
  of $11.9K.
  
  Whether or not the car you're asking about is a good deal though will 
  depend on a mechanical inspection that shows no major problems.
  
  Check out whether the car has a serial number greater than 1000 which
  would indicate that the car has the S4 suspension with the big brakes.
  
  BTW, the '86 did have a 32 valve engine like the S4, but it wasn't truly
  an S4 engine (like it states in the ad) since the output was only 288hp 
  vs the 316hp for an S4.
