I am not a mechanic, Im not dumb but I have never had the luxury of time =
to really get into these things. Hopefully I wont need to be a mechanic =
to understand your answer:

1. When one of the joints fail, and the car 'drops to the ground' what =
is the contact point? (I have a 78, looking underneath it looks like the =
body/frame would hit first, depending on the location of the break) I =
imagine it would be tricky to steer.. :)

2. What have you been quoted in the past for the steel upgrade? I just =
got a quote from a european performance house that included alignment =
'on a real bosch alignment rack' for $460 parts and labor inclusive.

3. Has anyone had this done at a dealer? When I called my local dealer =
'Pioneer Centres Porsche/Land Rover' they called me back and REFERENCED =
me to another performance place that I had never heard of. Doesnt =
porsche have an upgrade for this part?

4. Is there a way to tell if the ball joint is nearing the end of its =
service life? I imagine a test using a caliper to see if the part is =
warped or looking for surface cracks etc. My own mechanic says that they =
include the ball joints in their regular safety inspection and that they =
didnt say anything to him about it so they 'must be ok' - But then I had =
another guy telling me that he wasnt aware of a way to check, and in =
fact had another 78' 928 in 'three weeks ago' for a safety inspection =
which it passed, only to have the ball joint fail during a low speed =
maneuver.

5. Obviously I will have mine replaced for ~ $460 before I put my car =
into the Silver State Classic and run it 160mph.. But for day to day =
driving, how often do these things fail? How many people on the list =
have had first or second person experience with these on a 78' or any of =
the years that used aluminum?
