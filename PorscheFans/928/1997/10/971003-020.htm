Maybe not, unless there is a short across all of the idiot lights (highly
unlikely) the connectors will not cause all of the lights to stay on.

A couple of guesses are that the electrical part of the ignition switch is not
returning completely from the start position to the on or run position. Try
wiggling your key in the ignition after you start the car to see if it clears
the lamps off.

Another possibility is you could have a problem with your Central warning unit
or the associated wiring between it, your ignition switch and warning reset
switch.

Take a close look and make sure all of the warning indicators are on and stay on
, including your parking brake , etc. Let us know.


> My questionis, do I have to remove the whole dashboard to remove the pod?
Nope.

> Question 2.  What do you guys use to raise the car to work on it.
>I have ramps but the car is too low to get on the ramps.  I really don't
>trust jacks and jack stands.  Any suggestions?
Good solid jack stands used properly are just as safe as anything.
Take a close look at some of the NASCAR shows etc. on TV. Look closely in the
background (sometimes in the foreground) and you will always see very expensive
race cars sitting on just 4 jack stands with out any wheels on them. This might
help you to gain a little more faith in jack stands.

A suggesting for getting your low rider on to those ramps is to build your self
a "pre-ramp" made of layers of plywood stacked in a step fashion to change the
ramp angle on your existing ramps or build complete custom ramps with this same
process.

See cheesy ASCII example below:
