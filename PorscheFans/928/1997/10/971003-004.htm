On October 1, 1997, I wrote to the list:

Several readers took the time to post and email comments on the statement.
I have responded directly to several, as I normally don't try to pig
bandwidth for such things.  The additional posts to the list seem to deserve
a broadband response.



My suggestion was to "think carefully" before disabling the cat.

--One responder suggests that many cars can pass without the cat if properly
maintained.  With all due respect to the readers, most are not trained or
equipped to keep a car in compliance without the catalyst.

--The big-bore catalyst used on these cars provides the absolute minimum
back pressure possible, thanks to some pretty sound engineering work by the
factory.  For normal street driving,  the difference made by taking out the
cat and replacing with a straight-through 'test pipe' is not significant.
If you find yourself street racing Mustangs a lot this may seem a little
more important.  However, most 'improvements' like this tend to be
accompanied by other changes like headers and/or big bore dual exhaust
systems.  Tough to identify which of the changes actually improve the
performance when you do them all at once.

--The original poster's question was whether the car would pass smog with
the cat removed.  Here in California and most other states,  the smog check
now includes a visual inspection for correct components.  A 'test pipe' car
would fail this test.  So my reply should have been a simple "NO!" and let
the subject die at that.  Seems kind of rude without an explanation, though.

--One interesting response aimed at 'other' polluters as the true cause of
smog.  I have a 2 garages worth of polluting toys.  My concern is that
do-gooders will choose to legislate me out of being able to play with them
when current regulations fail.  Guess it's a matter of where one wants to do
their dirties.  If your road car is your only toy,  then you make the choice.

--Lots of things are illegal, and probably shouldn't be.  It's a felony in
many states for me to practice oral s*x with a girlfriend.  However,  here's
a prime case where a large diameter straight through low back pressure pipe
makes a measurable improvement in performance.  At least based on my 'seat
of the pants' testing program.  =8-)

Enough said.

'gross' polluter in the truest sense.
*not* a tree hugger.
republican with a big dose of libertarian thrown in.


OPC:
I learned yesterday that when a Mustang driver gives you the finger it means
he wants to race.  I learned yesterday that Mustang drivers seem to get
really upset if you ignore them or laugh at them.  Still less dangerous than
street racing in traffic, but not by much these days...
