Triumph models (certainly my Spitfire) used to have a similar problem: as pivot
point in the front suspension they had a brass trunnion that should be filled with
oil regularly. Many "mechanics" put grease in them to bypass the messy oil
procedure. The grease dried out, no lubrication, and eventually they failed: the
front wheel just fell off. I know off one guy who had this at the sharp turning
entrance of a very busy parking garage! It always happened at parking speeds and
that was "explained" by the large transversal forces in that situation. Triumphs
with this front wheel suspension had very narrow turning circles, you could almost
put the wheels perpendicular to the car. Imagine the forces.

There is of course no guarantee it won't happen at high speeds.
