I was under the impression that a shirt design either existed or was being
designed specifically for the 928 porsche fans.  Can anyone confirm this or
am I just in my usual confused state?

Now a more important question.  I'm getting ready to have restoration work
done on the wheels on my 78.  I'm just bringing my phone dials back to the
factory finish.  They are badly tarnished.  At the same time I was looking
at my brake calipers and did not see "Porsche" in raised letters on the
calipers.  I was under the impression this existed on all models from 1972
on.  Does anyone know if this is true?  I might have after market calipers.
 I was going to have my calipers powder coated to match my car.  Has anyone
done this?  I'm concerned it might not hold up well.  I could just polish
them which looks pretty good but requires quite a bit of work to sustain.
I was also going to install drilled rotors, just for appearence.  Can
anyone suggest a brand and or style?
