This all makes sense so far (but not dues on top of PCA dues right?).  I
don't know if tech speakers get paid but if dues are required then that
should clear the way for very detailed sessions.  The newsletter
is/would be expected by the members and there's probably the first rub
since 'our' informal roots stem from here, porschefans, free access (but
then no factory-recognized expert guidance either, mostly me typing too
much in the middle of the night  :P     But I doubt any of us will
abandon this format so maybe that's moot too.  (BTW  thanks again to
porschefans and the former ioio.com service too for providing the
electronic medium for us!  Look how we've grown in just over a year!).

Also, I can tell how passionate all you owners are about the 928 - there
really aren't any more coming out of Porsche but we definately can and
should hold our own as the numbers decrease due to attrition.  Hmm I
just said the same thing twice.  Sorry!  You know,
theft/damage/fire/etc.   I also know that this is getting away from the
original request someone made to me about an owners club without '...all
the b.s. rules and regulations, just a bunch of us showing how much we
love our cars...'  but there's no reason that can't happen as well
whether it's in conjunction with the PCA, or, just plain a bunch of us
getting together for brews/cruising whenever we feel like!  Blame it on
Porsche for building such a fantastic car that ownership attracts
educated, competitive, loyal, inquisitive types that want to go for it
all!

In closing (whew!) we have the chance to pick-up the torch where others,
even the factory , have let it dim and flicker.  Of course we want to
keep it fun, exciting and even dangerous at times.   No one will be
forced to do anything they don't want to ie.join, however as time passes
and we add benefits of membership, there should be no reason not to join
the '928 Owners Club' / 'Sharks Club / ?!

aside:  Lucky Ekman is tentatively scheduled to be with us on the west
coast August 2nd, and I might be able to talk him into giving a paid
tech session on whatever (major?) topic attendees are interested in?
ie. improving 16v and 32v street performance on a budget, or ???   Ideas
anyone?  (also if anyone thinks there might be a profit involved, we can
informally adopt the PCA regs right now about charging to cover costs
only and generate at least $1.50 per event I think it is)

There's also the possibility Kim would make it out also but don't know
for sure on that in light of the Aug. 5th PCA race date at Brainerd.
But hey it's 'our' 20th Anniversary and maybe birthdate of the first
ever  U.S. National 928 club! (there goes another name)

Ok 928 ownersl, make your voice heard - feedback appreciated - it's only
typing at this point!
Phil
ps.  David,  I keep checking my mail for the latest (PCA) Panorama mag
with the 928 article by Kim but all I have is this Road & cr*p I mean
Track with stuff on that other Porsche...  at least there's an article
on the Shelby GT-350.  Gosh I miss my Dad :(
