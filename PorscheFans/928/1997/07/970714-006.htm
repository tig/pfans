I see, this is the way I would've made it - I'm sure the other car I saw
was not this way - reel was in the cargo area, went up to the loop on
the C-pillar, and then attached to where my reel currently is.  Thus, it
seem like to do the conversion correctly, I'd really need different trim
pieces (but since the plan is to put a cage in this winter, we wouldn't
worry about that).

Nope.  Solved that problem already.

Hope somebody else out there can qualify what I saw on the other car (to
which I no longer have access).  It seems PorscheFans logged everybody
off - we were down to only 35 people this am versus 760 last week.

Best,
