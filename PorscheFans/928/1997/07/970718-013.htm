 Kurt,
From your description I think you are ready for new motor mounts. The mounts are
filled with a fluid and will rupture from heat and age. Worn motor mounts will
give  the exact vibrations that you describe. I have had the identical
vibrations and replaced motor mounts and the vibrations disappeared.

>Problem:  Since I got the car, the engine has produced a bad vibration
>at ~1400, ~2800 rpm. Certainly we're hitting a resonance in the car (the
>whole car shakes) - the engine is exciting it at the rotation frequency.
>(I used an Analog Devices accelerometer chip to measure the frequency of
>the vibration.  Neat chip!)

>My speculations:  Certainly an out of balance flywheel or clutch
>(pressure plate) would cause this.  I've had the clutch out and it
>looked OK.  It vibrates independent of whether it's in gear or not,
>clutch in or out - therefore I conclude it's not the torque tube, clutch
>disc, or tranny.  (I'd expect a misfire to usually vibrate @ f/2 with
>some multiples.)  Both of these really seem pretty unlikely (but that
>doesn't prove they're not the problem).

>1) Anyone else experience this/what was the cause?

>2) Does anyone have an old pressure plate for me to try a swap?  I'd
