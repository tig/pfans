Hi all:

If you ask me, I'd say this is a clear indication to start changing your
oil and filter more often, check the type of oil & weight, as well as
maybe replace the sender and part of the harness.  Also, stick with the
OEM oil filter - aftermarket replacements might not have the proper
valving etc. as true Porsche spec filters.  I'd do the oil & filter
change now while you've just finished your track event and maybe
unloosened some nastiness.


What I've experienced:
'84 S,  oil unknown 1.5 bar idle, 5 bar normal speeds
'84 S,  Castrol synthetic 2  bar idle, 5 bar normal  (20 - 50wt)

'90 GT,  oil unknown 2 bar idle, 5 bar normal
'90 GT,  Mobil 1 2.5 bar idle, 5 bar normal (15 - 50wt)

With near 2 gallons of oil in the case, it takes awhile to heat to
operating range.  During that time, pressure stays 5 bar (of course).
When the water temp reads slightly above half, then pressure starts to
come down to 4 bar, etc.    Putting fresh oil in the car is one of my
favorites so I don't mind  frequent changes (but should start driving
the car less now - I've put miles on it already! Ahh, summer!).

Phil
