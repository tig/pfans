No, it isn't. My car wore its original rear tires (Michelin XGT) uniformly
across the tread, and these were mounted on the stock 8" rims and run at
the (accurately measured) 44 psi cold, which, as you've observed, was
necessary to get good handling. When I changed the tires to Michelin MXX3,
also run at 44 psi, those also wore uniformly. Since I replaced the wheels
with GTS-spec 17" units and put Michelin Pilot SX MXX3 on them, the rears,
running at the GTS-spec 36 psi (where they handle better than the 16" items
ever did), have worn uniformly across the tread. This car is driven in all
conditions, including very high speeds, very hard cornering and braking,
and the occasional autocross.

>Of course, this could be by tire manufacturer. I am currently using the

Eagle what? Goodyear makes lots of tires called Eagle something-or-other,
but I've never encountered a model by this name, and the possibility that
the tires are the issue makes me want to know just what's there. Would you
please go out and look at the tires (all four) and read off the full model
name and post what you find? 

While you're there, please also read and post the sizes marked on the
tires. Your car's rears should be 245/45VR17 or (preferably, now that you
have the option; Z-rated tires weren't available in '88) 245/45ZR17, and
Goodyear currently doesn't make any tires in either size (I just checked
their Web site). This makes me wonder if you're running something which is
unhappy mounted on your wheels.

This unhappiness could also have to with speed rating. If your current
tires are not rated for high speed, they may be distorting at speed and
wearing in the middle (I'm thinking of a AA fuel dragster's rear tires at
the start of a race).

The S-02 is a terrific tire. Hopefully those won't wear in the middle for you.
