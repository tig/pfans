From time to time the 928 list gets bogged down with B. S. .  Most of us
can live with that but this total flaming JERK Matthew complaining about
an honest business is too much.  Matthew must be a virus trying to pass
himself off as a Porsche owner wronged by his perception that he has
been somehow offended by the GPR store in San Louis Obispo CA.  It he
treats his parts supplier the way he treats the list members I would
tell him to go to hell too.  I think there is a possibility that all
this stuff is an effort to advertise and push parts for the Parts
Haven.   
Matthew has successfully clogged up ALL the PorscheFans lists including
the Flamers (Where stuff like this belongs)and I am tired of it.  

If any customer has a problem with a supplier, don't give the suplier
your business.  That is all that is necessary.  Sooner or later the word
will get out without disrupting our enjoyment on our 928  page.  We
don't even know if this jerk even owns a 928 or if he even owns a
Porsche maybe he is a shill for the Parts Haven.  

List Administrator!!! Do something about this idiot and keep his moronic
outbursts off our list.

Thanks,

Don Vellenga
