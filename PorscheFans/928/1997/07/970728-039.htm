Thanks for the info about the electrical system.

On the other subject, I think that sucks!  You ought to subscribe to "RADAR
Inc".  It's a publication concerning transportation issues on the John Q.
Publics side of the law.  The RADAR publication stands for Radio
Association Defending Airwave Rights Inc.  Their phone number is:  (800)
448-5170  Join and you get great information regarding speed traps, how to
fight a ticket, how laser is inaccurate..etc..etc.  That's where I learned
about the deceased man receiving a p-radar ticket.  Somewhere in the law
books it says that you, "the defendant", have the right to defend yourself
in court and be prepared for it.  With the p-radar you don't get a chance
to prepare a defense.  So on that premise alone most states don't allow it.

Even though we don't have p-radar in Michigan, I have a p-radar license
plate cover.  It is similar to window blinds in that you can read the plate
from straight on, but not from an angle...like where a p-radar picture
would be taken from.  Probably illegal in your state also eh?
