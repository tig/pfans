Oooh, fresh meat for pedants! Your friend came up with a plausible
explanation, but the real story is somewhat different. I'm paraphrasing
from the Bosch Automotive Handbook, which is now in its fourth edition and
crammed with auto-techno goodies; buy it ($35 = cheap!) from the mail-order
parts houses or SAE (the Society of Automotive Engineers;
http://www.sae.org/PRODSERV/BOOKS/026/02089.htm).

Each wheel has a sensor looking like a thick button which is mounted in the
rim so it is exposed on one side to the air inside the tire. Inside the
sensor is a box filled with inert gas at a known pressure. One wall of this
box is a stainless steel diaphragm, to which is attached an electrical
contact. This contact usually touches a stationary contact inside the box,
but moves away when the tire pressure drops below a certain value.

When the contacts are closed, a tuned circuit inside the sensor is
complete. A second sensor is mounted in close proximity to the inside of
wheel rim. This one, which is fixed to the non-rotating parts near the
wheel (e.g., the brake caliper), sends out a faint radio signal at a fixed
frequency. When the tuned circuit in the moving sensor is complete, it
loads the signal sent by the fixed sensor once per revolution. This


momentarily reduces the strength of the RF signal, causing the fixed sensor
to send out a pulse. If the pressure drops, the tuned circuit in the moving
sensor is interrupted, no loading of the RF signal occurs, and no pulses
are sent by the fixed sensor.

The logic of the system is then: steady stream of pulses = adequate
pressure, no pulses = low pressure. If the moving sensor malfunctions, or
if you fit wheels without these sensors, there are no pulses, and you then
receive a constant warning about low tire pressure. This
driver-antagonizing feature is one of the reasons that Porsche saw fit to
remove this system from the latest GTSs.
