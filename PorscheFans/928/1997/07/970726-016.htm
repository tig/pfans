Will,

Regarding your concerns about jump-starting the 928...

- If the battery is completely dead, I agree you'd have about the same
situation as having no battery at all.  I'd refrain from a jump start in
that case.  When I jump mine, I always give the battery about 10 minutes to
re-charge before starting.  That's enough of a charge to run lights, radio,
etc. so there is battery voltage there - but not enough to turn the engine.

- As for the $1700 brain, it should be able to tolerate the spikes
generated by connecting/disconnecting jumper cables.  I'd be interested to
hear if anyone has fried theirs by jump-starting.  Automobile electric
systems are full of spikes and voltage fluctuations just in normal use so I
would think the brain would be built to take it.  All bets are off, though,
if you hook the cables up backwards.  Electronics really hate it when that
happens.

- I traced the cause of my battery drain a couple of years ago and there
were several current sinks (stereo memory, clock) but by far the most
guilty drain was the Porsche alarm system.  I don't remember how many
milliamps it was drawing (I think around 20), but I do remember it was
responsible for over 90% of the drain.  If the 20 ma figure is close, that
should not be enough to drain a strong battery in 3 weeks.  My battery is
over 5 years old and is probably kind of tired.
