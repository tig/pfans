Hi Stephan,

I've been following your trials and tribulations as you've rebuilt your
brake system, and of course I'm not one to say "I told you so," but the
temptation sure is strong! :)

Same type of brake problems happened to me about a year ago.  I replaced my
master cylinder and presto!  no more problems.  The tip off to the master
cylinder as the culprit (as opposed to individual brake pistons) was the
fact that all four brakes would lock up.  All my symptoms were the same as
yours -- including having them lock up on the highway at speed and sitting
on the side of the road for half an hour until everything cooled off and
freed up.

The good news is that its relatively easy to change the master cylinder.
And its not the most expensive part I've ever bought.  Just be careful you
don't pull hose off the clutch master cylinder!!  Yes, I did, and no, I
didn't enjoy replacing it.

Good luck to you!
