Where are you situated?  If money is of some concern, finding a mechanic
you can trust might be the first thing you consider.  Then look for
the car you want and ask your mechanic to evaluate the car you plan
to buy.

It is my belief that Porsche are very good car if they are properly
maintained.  If you buy a bargain, you might need to have a lot of
repair to the car before it is considered a daily driver.  Investing
up front can make a big difference in the long run.

Also, if money is tight, you might want to discuss the insurance cost
with your broker.  Depending on the model, and especially with the
fact that
	 1. Porsche are sports car
	2. Insurance people thinks old Porsche are worth the same as new
		(only for the purpose of charging you a fee)
	3. You are a male less then 25 years old (translation to the
		insurance company: someone that we can overcharge due
		to the mistake of others in his age group)

Hope this helps,
