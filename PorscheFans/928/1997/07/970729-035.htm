 ----------
Hello everyone, again, It seems that I never get any solid reply's to my   
emails. I guess you all have too many questions about the average age of   
the group, and drag racing your cars in the middle of the night, to   
answer my desperate calls for help. My car is NOT driveable without the   
transmission linkage working. I've found the problem. When I crawled   
under my car I found that the linkage bends when trying to push the   
transmission lever back into park or reverse, but I can move the lever   
smoothly by hand. So, I need help from anyone who has ever replaced this   
linkage ( it's an automatic) ! Which interior parts to take off, exhaust   
etc. ? If you want to hear a crazy story before you reply, then here   
goes... I was playing golf with a friend on the 4th of July, and when we   
got home I asked if he wanted to go for a ride in my 928, he foolishly   
said yes. He also owns a 928, so naturally he was curious about any   
additional tips or pointers he could get from me during our outing. We   
made it approximately a mile before I came to a familiar corner, where I   
usually get my car a little sideways. I glanced over to make sure he was   
buckled in and then told him to hold on. We hit the corner at about 60-65   
mph, which happens to be a 90 degree bend, and I immediately pitched the   
car sideways. I kept the power on and corrected lock right, but this time   
I wasn't so lucky. The car ripped around in a fast 180 arc, and slammed   
into the curb with enough force to destroy the rim, crush the CV joint at   
the tranny, bend the stabilizer arm and bend the lower control arm. The   
impact was so great that the mirror flew off along with a few weaker   
pieces in the car. So here we are facing the wrong way on a oneway,   
without a prayer, looking for a few friendly motorists to help push the   
car off the road. So three weeks later, after replacing all the   
suspension pieces, I'm still stuck without my 928. Hopefully this is the   
last item. I guess I won't be able to make the DEVEK bbq.

Thanks again,
Richard Gastineau (oh, by the way, I'm 35 and I used to drag race in High   
school with a 66 El Camino with a corvette motor and 4.56 gears, with an   
m22 with straight line linkage, and then converted to an automatic with a   
Hole Shot torque converter with 3000 stall)
