No offence taken. <G> My point was that 'cavitation' at the pump is not
a concern to me. My apologies if I didn't make that clear. That was the
fundamental purpose of my response to Stephane. And the bit about high
frequency resonance arises as a real issue for me with my race bike.
With a power band of 8,000 to 11,400 rpm and a fuel cut-out at 12,300
(and desmodromic cams to run the valve train) there are high frequency
resonances that can cavitate the coolant flow. May not be significant
with the 928?

Have done this twice, same day, same equipment, same ambient temp.,
etc., all within an hour or so at Pocono race track. Ran a practice
session with just water. Ran the next with Water Wetter added. Sceptical
of results so repeated above to see if results could be replicated.
Results replicated.

The thermostat was WFO all the time.
