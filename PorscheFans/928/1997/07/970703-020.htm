robert, and other 928ers:

	this is a very interesting subject. i have been thinking lately
about buying a newer sports car (i really, really want a cabriolet of 
some type, i also have some lust for a GTS). the question this brings 
up is: what to do with 'the pig' ('79 928, mostly original).

	options as i see it:

	- trade it in on a new boxster, or sell it. (both financially
equivalent to giving
			it away!)
	- keep it in original condition, stored in the new shop/shed
that
			i'm building this summer, until its 'a classic'
and worth
			something closer to what i paid for it
	- strip it and make an autocross/club racer toy out of it.

	the first seems stupid, the second somewhat wasteful and
possibly
wishful thinking, and the last somewhat sacrilegious(sp?). so here i
sit, working
on the plans for the shop and wondering if i should risk a test drive in
a boxster
or a Z3 2.8.

	what are you guys gonna due with your old 928s?
