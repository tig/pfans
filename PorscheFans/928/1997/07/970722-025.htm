I don't know if there is a reason to turn on blower and rear window
heater or not, but I don't think that the quoted explanation holds
water. 

"When jump starting...current remains high. ... The blower and rear
window heater are large current consumers..."

Both the battery charging and the blower/heater are large current
consumers. The spike from disconnecting a high current connection to
the battery should be made worse by adding more current consumers. 

Something must be whacked out in the magazine article, or the AAA guy
has it wrong.
