Hi All!

Just for the heck of it, I thought that I would share this with you. "Jim"
has been tackling a problem in which his car will sometimes crank but not
start and he is looking at his Temp Sensor II. Now my Euro spec 1980 928S
has the old Bosch K-Jetronic system, which is largely mechanical, but it did
a similar thing just once and "Jim's" posting reminded me of it.

I went to use the 928 but it just wouldn't start so I took my wife's Suzuki
Vitara. On the way out, I was a little testy and so my wife stated that
maybe someone didn't want me to use the Porsche that morning. My comment was
that that person can fix it whilst I am gone. When I returned, I tried the
928 and it fired up first time! SPOOOKY!!!

Regards         | 1980 Porsche 928S (Euro 300 bhp, 5 speed)
John Stapleton  | 1996 Suzuki Vitara (2 litre quad cam 24 valve V6)
