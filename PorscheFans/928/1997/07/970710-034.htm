Phil,
Swepco and Redline are probably both the best on the market. Redline seems 
to be promoted and marketed more aggressively  than Swepco. On the other 
hand if you go to most Professional Manual Trans and Rearend Specialists 
they will recommend Swepco and it is usually the only lube you can use in 
their rebuilt units and not void the warranty.
 Keep in mind the 911 and the 928, both great cars, one marketed to death, 
while the other is left to prove itself on its own merit.

If you are seriously considering falling into the "smoke and mirror" trap 
of DuraLube, I am very worried about you. I think you should keep that GT 
below 170mph for a little while, you could be suffering from O2 
depravation.

Always remember to breath normally when you let that BEAST run WILD. :-)


P.S.- K-Mart is having a "Blue Light Special" on DuraLube as we type.
