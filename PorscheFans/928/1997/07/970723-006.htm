	Hi Jason and all of you 928 fans,

Just to introduce myself, I'm only a recent subscriber, my name is Leon
v/d Willik.  I'm a 928 driver from the Netherlands.  You know, clog
country, tulip country or whatever you want to call it.  I saw Jasons
message and thought, what the hell I'll just reply to it.  So here's my
contribution.  Hope it helps.


> "Schlusslicht", these are the small lights in front of the car which
identify the left and right most size of the car, or the width if you
want to call it that.  You know, those small 4W bulbs positioned in the
same reflector as your fog lights.  They are not just the rear lights,
although these are also on.  In the Netherlands they are often referred
to as city lights.

> "Bremslicht" these are petty obvious the brake lights.

> "Wa. Wasser" I'm not sure though but I think this one is the indication that
the water reservoir for your window wipers is empty. (Warnung Wasser)

> "Ku. Wasser", this one is to indicate that your engine's cooling fluid is
below level and about to overheat or already overheating, check cooling
fluids.

> "Bremsflussigkeit", indicates that the brake fluid is below level and that
you need to add, or better first check if there are any leaks in the
system or if your brake discs and brake blocks are still up to the
required standard, before adding brake fluid.

> "Bremsbelag", Brake lining or how much is still left on your brake blocks

> "Bremskreis", literally translated it means brake circle, I have no idea
what it refers to though.  It might be that it indicates something
wrong with the brake discs, although I've never seen any sensors in
that area.  On my old 85, 928S I have never seen such an indicator.

> "Handbremse", pretty obvious I think.  It indicates that the hand brake is
activated, or in the US probably called the emergency brake.

> "Delstand", Check again Jason.  Delstand is Oelstand and indicates that the
level of oil in your engine is below the required standard.

I hope it helps.

All the best

PS:  Does anyone know some interesting 928 sites, except the ussual
928s4vr or porsche fans or the international porsche dealers.  There
seems to be next to nothing about the 928.
