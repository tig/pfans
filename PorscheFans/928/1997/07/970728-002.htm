What a great question for the experts  Lucky and Marc at the tech
session!  I will pose the question to them.

I think the answer lies in the shape of the combustion chamber - are you
supposed to point the plug at the tightest squish point so the
spark/flame creates maximum force or at the greatest concentration of
air/fuel mixture for same effect?   This is another example of the black
art of engine tuning.  Some claim they can even feel the difference
indexed vs. non-indexed, though exactly what they mean by feel is
unclear.  I'd like to know the details also since I'm a firm believer of
maximizing what you got and especially 'free hp' tips like this!   (a
previous thread about heavier wt. oil dragging 1-2hp off was interesting
but I'm sure we'd all forego that drain for the added protection).

My .02 cents here is:  TorqueMasters don't even have the common
protruding electrodes!   Did Hot Rod (an old fav of mine) mention these
plugs at all?   I can't wait to get 'em in here...  A trick I've used is
to open the plug gaps a bit further - fatter spark better burn - but
your wires and coil have to be up to snuff.

Sheesh, I wish Sears Point was open right now!  (I made a lap of the
wine country late last night and drove past their gates even - all the
track lights were on too!)
