>A self-important young man goes out and buys the best car available:
>a 1997 Porsche 911 Turbo.  It is one of the fastest and most
>expensive cars  in the world.  He takes it out for a spin and, while
>doing so, stops at a red  light.  An old man on a moped (both looking
>about 90 years old) pulls up next >to him.  The old man looks over the sleek,
>shiny surface of the car and asks,  "What kind of car ya' got  there, sonny?"
>The young man replies, "A 1997 Porsche 911 Turbo.  They cost
>$100,000."  "That's a lot of money," replies the old man.  "Why does
>it cost so much?"  "Because this car can do up to 180 miles an hour!"
>states the young man >proudly. The moped driver asks, "Can I take a
>look inside?"
>
>"Sure," replies the owner.
>
>So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.
>Leaning back on his moped, the old man says, "That's a pretty nice
>car, all  right!"
>
>Just then the light changes, so the young guy decides to show the old man
>what his car can do.  He floors it, and within 10 seconds the
>speedometer >reads 120 MPH.  Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear
>view mirror that seems  to be getting closer!  He slows down to see
>what it could be and suddenly,  whhhoooossshhh! Something whips by
>him, going much faster!
>
>"What on earth could be going faster than my Porsche 911Turbo?" the young man
>asks himself.
>
>Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot coming toward him.  Whoooooosh!  It goes by
> again, heading the opposite direction!  And, it almost looked like the old
>man on the moped!  "Couldn't be," thinks the guy.  "How  could a moped outrun
> a Porsche 911 Turbo?"
>
>Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror!
>Whooooosh-BLAMMM!  It plows into the back of his car.  The young man jumps
>out.  It is the old man!!!  Of course, the moped and the old
>man are  hurting for certain.
>
>He runs up to the old man and says, "You're hurt bad!  Is there anything I
>can do for you?"
>
>The old man groans and replies, "Yes.  Unhook my suspenders from your side
>view mirror."
