Yes it was a bargain. Its What I Had To Do to drive the car. About 4 months 
later I bought a "proper" set. You might note I only hacked together *one* 
replacement wire. Saw it in its box in the garage just a few minutes ago. 
Maybe I'll have to break down one day and buy a scanner to be able to post 
really ugly pictures.  :-)

The replacement set was certainly not genuine Porsche but Bosch "OEM" 
aftermarket with Beru connectors. Looks to be made of Hypalon or similar, 
and not silicon or silicone. No extra heat sheilds or anything like it. If 
somebody would bother to market black silicone wires with the proper ends 
to screw into existing Beru connectors then I'd certainly give it a stong 
consideration the next time I need wires.
