***  Ok, it's July 30 and we're 300+ strong!  Still a far cry from

the announcement one more time for those who may have missed it...

someone at Guiness?  This is going to be the largest gathering of 928s
in the world!

Clean up volunteers wanted!  Also, whoever's up for it, let's try to
cajole Lucky and crew, etc. into going out for dinner somewhere.  Hah!
Another 928 parade!  Hide your Vettes and 300ZX's for this one...

And don't forget the swap meet bargains you may find!  Hopefully we'll
see some of the folks from Carlsen Porsche, whose swap meet is the next
day, as well as the PCA "goodie store" booth- I need to fill in my
Up-Fixin collection and get some more stickers!  Hmm, maybe some advice
too on car prep so I can run in PCA classes also?

How to get there???
