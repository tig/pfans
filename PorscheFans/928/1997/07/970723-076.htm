The brake are easily done with a buddy willing to pump the brake.  In
my case, I use my wife (for better and worse...)

I bled the clutch the same way but I had some complication.  The clutch
is
spring loaded, you push the clutch, bleed the cylinder, but then the
pedal
did not go back up until the next day when I was able to pull it up.  It
works fine and my system may be defective but I am still puzzled.

Using a little vacuum pump works but you never know when the air is out
of your line because you get to suck air around the bleader threads.

The best solution is to buy/make a pressure bleeder system.  I am sure
someone on the list will elaborate on how to do this for very little 
cash.
