Well, it could be worse. In the UK these days, there are surveillance
cameras all over, some run by the police, some by local councils, all of
which automatically photograph your car when sensors connected to them
detect speeding, U-turns where not permitted, stopping in a marked
intersection (box junction) on a red light, or whatever else a given camera
is programmed to notice.

The older cameras shoot your car from the rear with a visible flash; the
newer ones shoot from the front with infrared, so you don't even get the
flash and the image shows your face (yes, it was you driving that car) and
whatever other than looking straight ahead with both hands on the wheel you
may be doing at that moment, leading to further summonses for inattentive
driving (careful with that cell phone or map), open container (could be
soda but who knows), etc.

You get your summons in the mail and defense is difficult against
photographic evidence. Bottom line: you're always under scrutiny, and from
a machine without discretion.

The only good news about this is that it's expensive to keep the cameras
operational and loaded with film, so many of them are not actually taking
pictures. However, you don't know which those may be at any given moment.

So far, automatic traffic law enforcement of this sort has met fierce and
effective resistance in the US. Unless you like the above scenario, let
your elected officials (city, county, and state for direct jurisdictional
reasons; federal for civil rights reasons) know that you feel your civil
rights would be intolerably endangered by anything like this, and that
you'll only stand for live, human law enforcement.
