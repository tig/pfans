Hi, Brian!

I went through what you're going through a few years ago.  Here are a couple
of things I did which, in hindsight, really helped:
1)  RESEARCH- I bought all the papers and auto trader mags I could.  I
compared price, condition, etc. for about 9 months.  I'm pretty much a
purist- the best Porsche in my opinion is one that has been kept "stock"- so
I concentrated on unmodified, "non-race" vehicles.  I watched for cars
described as "all numbers authentic", etc.  After 2-3 months, I had a pretty
good idea of what was available in my area.\

2)  INSPECTION- I found a factory-authorized service place near me that all
the serious Porsche owners took their "pride and joy" to for service.  This
particular place is owned and operated by a father and son who love talking
about Porsches as much as they love working on them.  When I finally found a
car and was ready to buy, they did a buyer's inspection for me.  I consider
that this was money very well spent.  They were truthful with me, and told me
there'd be some work to do (they listed the things they saw that would need
to be done), but that the current owner was asking a fair price, in their
opinion.  They said the car was in excellent condition for the money- they
also recommended that I get a more recent model if I wanted to avoid repair
costs.

If you're looking at buying a '78 because you love '78's, then go for it.  In
my opinion the '78 had the best look the 928 ever had (I'm sure I'm in the
minority with that view)- it was clean, not a lot of "hang ons" (wings,
spoilers, etc.), just a clean shape.  If you're looking to economize and
still get into the V-8 Porsche, I'd recommend getting the most recent year
you can afford, unless you are really into repair and continuous upkeep.

The only production shortcomings I know of are these:

1)  CLUTCH FORK- apparently Porsche came out with a modified clutch actuation
fork after the '78 was produced.  I'm not certain of the specifics, I learned
of this by reading through the receipts that the prior owner had collected.

2)  RADIATOR- the radiator for the '78 928 is a two-tank model, with an
integral oil cooler.  I've been told that the radiator capacity was increased
on future models, and that the oil cooler was removed and made a separate
unit.

3)  CV JOINTS- I remember hearing this from a friend, who had a '78 928 back
in '79.  He hit something sliding the car sideways, and damaged a CV joint.
 When he went in to get the damage repaired (took it to the local Porsche
dealer, often a BIG mistake) they said that they'd come out with an updated
CV joint, and recommended he replace all his CV joints.

4)  RADIO- the stock radio/cassette deck in the '78 was a dog.  Even so, most
have been replaced (if you find one, and want to part with it, please let me
know!) so you probably won't run into that.

Good luck!  Keep us posted on your progress!!
