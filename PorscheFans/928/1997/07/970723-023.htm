A word of advice from extensive experience: forget it (okay, two words)

It is an old axiom of used car buying that you pay $.40 on the dollar for
repair/rehab. With a Porsche--especially a 928--it's more like $.15 on the
dollar.

Buy the bet car you can or it will (not) drive you to the proverbial poorhouse.

Example: I was looking for a track car, and checked out an '84 Euro car for $4K

1. mileage was suspect because the odo had broken (direct cost about $200,
but resale value is lessened)

2. interior typically 'shrunk out' $1000 to replace at 'swap meet' prices.

3. hood did not fit ($600 or more in body rack)

4. front bumper cover and spoiler torn $400-$750, plus labor & paint

5. sunroof inoperative ($50-200)

6. missing spare, jack, tools, inflator etc. $200-$500(!!!)

7. driver's window and passenger mirror inop. ($100-300)

8. clutch marginal (eventual $1500?)

9. maintenance records nonexistant ($400-$800 in preventative replacements
of belt water pump, hoses, etc.)

10. engine not smooth (anything from a collapsed lifter to broken
rings/fouled plugs to bad F.I.)

11. exhaust leak ($$$)

....and so on. Not a bargain at $4K. Not even a bargain at $3K. Part-out
value is about $2400.

My advice: seek out a good car. The best you can buy.
If you must have a 'rehab' car, buy one with moderate body damage. You will
know you only have one aspect of the car to fix, and you can get parts at
very good prices--relative to Factory prices, that is.

Remember that the 928, while capable of 200K relatively trouble-free miles,
is unloved in the used car market, so minor repairs (in Porsche terms) can
quickly add up to more than the value of the entire car.
