 David,
Help me out with your last post to Jim, it seems your message to him is
quite confusing, of course it could just be the heat in HOTLANTA.

You make this sound like Jim dosn't have a problem, just normal resistance
variances from differant locations of voltage sampling, especially since the
higher voltage was taken at the remote start terminal which is about 6-8
feet (wire footage) closer to the alternator . Plus I am sure that the
factory gauge will never be as accurate as a DMM.

Please help to make this a little clearer for Jim and myself.
