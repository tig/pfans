John it's funny that this happen to you, it also happen to me.
I was sure that my ignition timing was off. I took it to my mechanic and
he told me that because my air filter housing has a crack in it, it was
allowing
dust and dirt to bypass the air filter. At the inside the bottom of the
lower air filter housing is
a mesh of wires, these are electronic sensors, should too much dirt/dust
get past the
air filter, it causes the car to idle rough and shutoff when not depressing
 the gas pedal. Funny thing about it
is that I did not believe him, he took a rag (non-lint), reached inside the
 lower filter housing into the circular
hole and wiped dust off the wire mesh (it had alot of black soot). I then
cranked up the car and
it was purring just fine again. I never knew that this would affect my cars
 performance.

Note: I thought just changing the air filter would do the trick, but every
now and then I open my filter housing
and wipe the mesh of wires (habit). I wonder if anyone else in this group
has heard of this.

It is probably a good idea to check this periodically, this may verify if
you K&N filter is
doing it's job.

DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN PURCHASE A NEW AIRFILTER HOUSING, 928
INTERNATIONAL HAS NONE.
(1986 928S), THESE PARTS COST $200.00 A PIECE - UPPER AND LOWER ($400).
PLEASE E-MAIL WITH ANY INFO
