Thanks for the reply. It was my understanding that under "normal" 
acceleration the transmission took off in second gear as a concession to 
fuel efficiency and that full throttle would close the switch and cause 
it to use first. Hence my question about 4 gears even when using much 
less than full throttle. Your explanation of the switch function is more 
akin to a kick down which is interesting because I don't always find it 
kicks down when I think it should. I had assumed that one of the cables 
from the accelerator bell crank connected to the transmission to activate 
the full throttle kick down. Making assumptions can often be a bad thing 
of course. I've found, of late, that this is particularly true when 
dealing with the 928. Further examination is obviously needed.
