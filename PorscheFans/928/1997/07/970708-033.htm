Hi All!

What a pity I get this list in Digest form as all the banter is over and
done with by the time I get to read it. Also, I only up/download my mail
once a day. Then, when I reply, it is old hat. Oh well, here goes!

I am not making excuses for adapting non genuine parts to our 928's but
sometimes getting ripped off gets tiring. Likewise I am not saying that all
928 parts are expensive, sometimes the contrary. A couple of examples of
surprisingly low cost parts are the clutch and brake pedal rubbers at
Aus$4.45 and the seat belt exit plastic trim piece behind your shoulder at
around Aus$3.50. However, when quoted Aus$300 to Aus$600 for genuine Porsche
spark plug leads, I had very little to lose than to experiment with the
K-Mart ones, and they work fine! The trick to running a car like the 928S is
to know when to spend a dollar and when to save a dollar. Likewise with home
maintenance, how much is your time worth? I do a lot of home maintenance but
when I needed a rear wheel bearing replaced recently, I got my local guys to
do it. They have been there, done that and built the right puller to do it.
I paid them a couple of hours labour and saved myself a weekend of angst and
skinned knuckles. My original post was to bring to your attention that some
lateral thinking never hurt anyone. By the way, if my 928S NEEDED genuine
spark plug leads, it would get them. Also, regarding "what is your time
worth?", it depends what mode you are in. If I am in "work" mode, I try to
charge out as many of my hours as I can at the going rate, however, if I am
tinkering in my garage, I go into "hobby" mode and I am grateful for any
free therapeutic hours that I can get.

Lastly, I know that your banter was meant in good humour and I have taken it
that way.
See ya, Guys!

John Stapleton
