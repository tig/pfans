and BTW I hooked up my hoodlight too (tomorrow's race is at night) !  I
maintain the factory bulb housing is a mercury switch since my hood was
nowhere near that rubber boot switch on the fender (must be for the
alarm?), plus it's a one wire light circuit.  Who cares, it works now!
ps. strange thing was there was no corresponding wire lead in the heated
squirter bundle.  Maybe hood light is GT delete option/standard?  Other
GT owners please comment!  My hood light had length of white wire 24"
long that connected to nothing...

Shiny chrome like stuff under the hood will look way cool at night in
the pits!  Didn't have time to disco mufflers - maybe up there...or
maybe not, that's alot of hassle.

Post your ET guess now!
Phil
