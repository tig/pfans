Well, Kurt, if you're PO hadn't been so stingy you would have gotten all of
this material with your 928!  When I picked mine up I just used some of the
local roadmaps that were in the car instead of looking out the windshield,
plus I had a friend of mine sitting on the sunroof yelling: "watch out for
the Lexus... left in 3 sec... NOW!... get in the right lane..."  etc.

OK, you got me, actually I should have included a few well placed commas and
a period or two.  Oops.

And now for something completely different...
