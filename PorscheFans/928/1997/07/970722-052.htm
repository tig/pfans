My manuals show 15W50 as the recommended oil weight in some places, and
a range from 10W30 to 20W50 in others.

I'm running Red Line 10W40 in my car, since Red Line's 10W40 will
provide greater protection than the petroleum 20W50 oils.

More details:

VISCOSITY GRADE SELECTION

The proper viscosity grade to use depends on many factors such as
ambient temperature, miles on the engine, bearing and piston =
clearances,
and type of service. A general rule of lubrication is to use the lowest
viscosity possible which will provide the proper separation of metal.
Anything more than this minimum will increase power loss due to =
friction
and will reduce the pumpability of the oil at all temperatures. =
However,
one must consider synthetics differently when determining viscosity
requirements. At high speeds, a petroleum 5W30 can appear to be a 10W =
in
the bearings due to the shear stress, yet Red Line 5W30 will actually =
be
an SAE 30 in the bearings. There is a significant difference in
lubricating an engine with a 30 compared to a 10W. Red Line Synthetic
oil will provide better viscosity protection than the next higher
petroleum viscosity grade. If clearances are tight and very little
lugging occurs, then the 5W30 or 10W30 should be adequate. Less turbo
lag will be noticed with the 5W30. If ambient temperatures will
regularly climb above 100=B0F, then the 10W40 would provide an =
additional
safety margin. If the engine is air-cooled, or if the engine is older
and has greater bearing and ring clearances, the 15W50 and 20W50 will
develop a thicker oil film. If very low temperatures
occur, the lower viscosity grades, (5W30, 10W30, or 10W40) will flow
better and lubricate the engine more quickly after start-up.=20
