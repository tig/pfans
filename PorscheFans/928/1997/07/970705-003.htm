	I would have to agree with the statement above.

With a $30,000 (1980 money - which was a <bold>hell</bold> of a lot back
then & still now) car, do you think Porsche would waste money on high
quality/performance parts that weren't necessary?  Same with tires, cam
belts, spark plugs, etc..etc..

	With that in mind, I think they've done their research & chose specific
products for a reason.  And that reason certainly wasn't to skimp on
performance based on cost savings.


If you had a bent rim, would you replace them with Crager mags?


If it was a Chevy muscle car or something to that nature, that's one
thing.  But not on a 928!


Just my 9<bold>*2*</bold>8 cents worth!
