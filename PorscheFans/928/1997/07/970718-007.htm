It may be that 'cavitation' is not the correct term of art to use in
describing the fluid dynamics or turbulence in a coolant system. First
off let me state that I am not qualified as a mechanical or fluid
dynamics engineer. However, I do understand that cavitation is the
formation of partial vacuums in a liquid by a swiftly moving solid body
or high-frequency sound waves. I do not believe it is cavitation caused
by a water pump that is the singularity degrading the process of heat
transfer. It is the 'cavitation' in the rest of the system (where the
process of heat transfer is in play, as differentiated from the process
of coolant flow), and specifically in the radiator, galleries in the
block and heads, and interconnecting pipes and hoses that is of concern.
The high-frequency resonance set up by the reciprocating mass, flame
front, exhaust gas pulses, etc., and the swiftly moving liquid through
rather narrow spaces of rapidly changing dimension (this particular
variable causes significant speed differential within this closed
system), geometry and direction (this particular variable causes
significant acceleration differential), and all of which surfaces are
varying in smoothness and porosity, that are the problems: Water Wetter
seems to provide a partial solution. It is the 'lubricating' properties
that allow Water Wetter to work by reducing the friction between the
coolant and the hard bits of the system, or so goes the manufactures
pitch. Interesting to note that it is the only additive allowed in
coolant water in AMA racing and most other motorcycle racing. Does not
make the track slick when spilled. Very trick stuff. One of the few
products I know of that for so little money and effort can make such a
big difference in performance. At the track, and doing me best to hold
all other variables constant, I have measured a coolant temperature
reduction from 91 C to 82 C. Quite significant from a 'seat of the
pants' performance perspective. It would be interesting to run such
tests on a dyno and see whether there is a rear wheel difference in
torque and horsepower.
