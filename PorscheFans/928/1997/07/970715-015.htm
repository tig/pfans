Matt,
CHECK YOUR OIL FOR SIGNS OF COOLANT, YOU MAY SEE A MILKY OPAQUE LIQUID ON
DIPSTICK.

I can think of 2 possibilities at the moment.

1 - You could have an internal head leak that is allowing the oil and coolant
to mix together.

2- You could have a "seal" leak, or small crack in the radiator that is letting
the oil and water mix together.

I will post this to the 928 Site and see if we get some other ideas.

If you can confirm that the sludge in your coolant is oil, or that you have
coolant in your oil, 
DO NOT START OR DRIVE YOUR CAR TILL THE PROBLEM IS FOUND.
