Hi everyone,

I'm new here to the list.  I've always been a fan of the 928, and 
finally had the money to buy one.  It's the first Porsche I've ever 
owned and it's been very enjoyable so far.  It's a bit rough around 
the edges, but I plan on doing a minor restoration over the next 
several years as time and money allow.  The car is a black 1984 
5-speed with about 60k miles on it.  It was most recently in Texas.

I do have a couple of questions I'm sure you all have answered 
before, but since I haven't got a clue what I'm doing here I'll ask 
them and hope somebody will help me out :-)

The leather on the dash shrunk (surprise surprise) from the sun in 
Texas.  The rest of the interior is in pretty good shape overall, but 
the previous owner (not caring much about the car I think) put a 
plastic cover (glue on type of thing) over the dash to make it look 
better.  IMHO it looks dumb as it's not the same color as the rest of 
the interior (what a knucklehead).  The question is, can this thing 
be recovered and how?  I've heard conflicting reports varying from 
no (gotta put on a new $3k dash) to yes, can be done with vinyl or 
leather.

Secondly, the car mechanically is in good condition (not perfect by 
any means) and runs well.  However, recently I have noticed some 
imperfections in how the motor runs.  On cold starts (most notibly 
with high ambient temps and high humidity, i.e. not in the garage), 
the car starts ok, but has a bit of hesitation or miss intermittantly 
until it warms up.  It idles fine (maybe a bit nervous, but not too 
bad), but a blip of the accelerator reveals the miss.  To my 
untrained nose it smells like it might be running a bit rich.  

Also, once the car is warm there is a bit of a rhythmic surge to the  
acceleration.  Under part or full throttle (most noticable in 2nd) 
through about 4000 rpm it feels like you would expect it to feel if 
you pumped the pedal just a little bit about every second or so.  
It's not a major deal, but I've noticed it from time to time.  At 
idle in gear (2nd for example at slow speeds) it surges just a tad.

Are these things related?  Has anyone else had a similar problem?  
Should I try to fix it myself, or take it to the mechanic?  Also, 
should I order the factory repair manuals or is there a better 
(and/or less expensive) book or set that I should look at?

Whew, that was a long message.  Sorry to bombard you all my first 
time out here :-)

Thanks in advance for the help and I look forward to sharing my 
experiences with you as time passes.
