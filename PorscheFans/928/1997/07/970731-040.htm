> I inspected my car when I bought it and found it to have no play,  2 weeks
>later during an oil change I found it had quite a bit of play so I adjusted
>it.
>It's the easiest bearing play adjustment I have ever done.
>Take off the wheels pop off the caps ( grabbed them with big channel locks
>and wiggled them off).
>Loosen the lock nut with an allen wrench ( you may have to spin the hub to
>access it).
>Tighten the lock nut with a socket until there is no play then tighten the
>allen bolt
>I don't know the specs just make sure it's not resisting rotation of the
>hub.
>It's a piece of cake toughest part was getting the bearing caps off
>especially cause they looked new and I didn't want to make them ugly.
