is safe...  I received one guestimate (13.34) but it 'broke out' of my
dial-in (13.95) and actual ET (14.29) note Porsche factory claim (14.1
secs).


Here's how it went:

I arrived at the end of qualifying due to a major traffic jam on the GGB
approach - this means I'll have to proceed stone cold!  Not even a
single practice run with the car!  The GT  gets tech'd as #377 in the ST
street class and I try desparately to remember the spec's from
Performance Portfolio vs. factory manual to come up with something to
write on the windows.  What though!

There are over 300 cars tonight, and the money racers are doing their
burnouts and runs as I lower  my rear tire pressure to 28psi while
parked in the staging lanes.  All the time mulling the numbers, let's
see Car and Driver did a 13.7 but they are really experienced.  Porsche
time was 14+ and usually conservative...  Sun is dropping and the air is
now quite clear and cool, though we have a good headwind to fight.  If I
break out of whatever I write down, I'm out.  Ok, 13.95 becomes my
dial-in time.

Then I wait in line for our group to be called up front.  And wait.  And
wait. And wait some more!  Great, I can warm the engine periodically to
keep the oil warm but that trans is going to be stone cold given it's
been hours since I first arrived.  Thankful the fluid was just
changed.   I resign myself to making one run and going home regardless
win/lose - as it's now after 9pm!

"Calling the NASA group to run..."  says the announcer over the PA -
it's showtime!  My opponent will be a full-race bug with wheelie bars
even dialed-in at 13.30.  I can't even hear my car when he initiates his
burnout.  The only way I can tell I'm doing anything similiar is that my
tach is straight-up and swining  and I see some smoke going by my
window.   One more short burn for good measure.   We both line up and
begin to stage the tree.

Yellow, yellow, yellow, GREEN!  The bug immediately pulls ahead and I'm
reminded that the 928 has no 60-foot speed whatsoever, plus I'm spinning
the wheels too!  Crap!  Keep going then Pull off a shift!  By mid-track
or so the GT is coming close to catching bug, I know now any longer of a
track and he'd be dogmeat.  We approach the traps and I must decide
whether to pull off another gear or not (hell I might've done one
already I can't even remember now) ,but  I'd lose maybe 4/10ths to the
shift but the tach is almost redlined!  Forget it, too late, keep your
foot in it!  Chase him down!

Since he's barely in front and knows it, the bug lifts throttle through
the lights to not break out but save the run - and unfortunately he
takes the win on my first and only run of the evening.  The tale of the
timeslip reveals it all:

Left lane (win)                                                 Right
lane (GT)
Dial-in    13.30                                                13.95
reaction:    .755                                                1.030
(ZZZzzzz)
I1 (60 ft)    1.688                                            2.191

E.T.        13.556                                             14.245
MPH        87.140 (embarassing!!!)                 99.324 (and pulling!)

over/under   .256                .                            295

I am deeply satisfied with the evening!  I'm within tenths of the
factory time and with at least a few practice runs could have done
better myself.  Now, Car and Driver did a 13.7 @ 104mph but that was
with a brand new GT with fresh plugs, better lauch I'm sure, etc.  13's
are definately within each and even a simple plug change (and not frying
the tires at the start) would put me there!

But enough of this type of abuse, at least until I do some major mod
that must be benchmarked.

With my new SA95 Shoei (Racer's Wholesale) I'm good to go for this
weekend's AX at 3Com, provided there's room for me and no emergency work
stuff to take me away!  And speaking of room, even though I'm only 5'6"
my helmet hits the roof sometimes.  Just how do you tall guys fit???

Also, there were quite a few former Pony Express entrants there and yes,
they all knew who DEVEK was!  I even had my DEVEK shirt that I bought at
the Parts Heaven swap meet so I felt like a star in my own mind :)
(BTW Marc, Todd is going to phone you, "...Where were you tonight , you
weinie"!) (heh heh those racers - the gauntlet is laid).  Even more fun
were all the folks who didn't know what the heck a 928 is!  Or that it's
shape was penned in the 70's!  I enjoyed playing 928 PR rep, opening the
hood and giving some details about the model, the list and the website.
And believe me, all eyes were on this "Stuttgart Express" - I'll post
pix when I finish the roll, hopefully before August!  Maybe we'll see
some threads in the future that read, "...I saw this 928 running at
Sear's and just had to get one..."

I never did find that Mustang.   N.A.S.A. entrants drew numbers so I
couldn't spefically pick to race those ZR1's, but if I do go back I have
a new target to beat and he's always there at the drags.  It was immense
fun those 14 or so seconds, but the most fun was all the prep, meeting
new people and even the drive home as everyone on the fast lane pulled
over for me all the way from Sonoma to the GGR toll plaza!  Plus Mom and
nephew Jeremy stayed up to hear all about it too.

Ok, who's next to hit the tracks! (or dyno at least)  These cars are
born to run not sit in the garage!
