<underline>Unbelievable</underline>!!!!!!!  That is EXACTLY what happens
to me!!!!!  I have the same set up and what I have narrowed it down to
this...


First, I don't think it's engine interference.


When my Valentine falses during hard acceleration, it's warning is on
laser with the 3 dashes on the display.  Never on x, k or ka.  This not
only happens during hard acceleration but when my fan blower turns on
high by itself.  Someone else had a similar problem (with the fan) on the
list a couple of months ago & I never saw a cure.  Only that it might be
the resistor in the ducts but I had that replaced and still have the same
problem.


So what I make it out to be is when the electrical system falls below a
certain voltage the Valentine goes into a false "startup" mode or
warning.  It never did this until I sent the Valentine in to upgrade to
laser.


I've also noticed the volt gauge was lower than usual, and then with the
additional load of the fan with a lot of other electrical load items on
such as; a/ca, headlights with 80/100's, wipers etc...it is lowered even
more.  So when the fan comes on high or I floor it, that momentary draw
or slipping belt is just enough for it to false momentarily.  It does not
continue to false during the entire acceleration.  It's seems like just
from the momentary low voltage it's set off.  How about yours?  similar
circumstances?


My best guess is it's the voltage regulator or the alternator or a
slipping alternator belt.  However, I took it to my mechanic and he put a
voltmeter under the hood and it measured consistently higher than what
the dash gauge was saying.  So he thought the alternator/voltage
regulator was ok.  We were both in a hurry when we tested it then and I
haven't pursued it further since.  (Too damn busy ya know!)  


So it's 5am over where I'm at and I apologize if I'm not making sense
cause I'm not a morning person and I will go back to sleep for another 5
hours at least.  I can barely keep my eyes opened now.  I just woke up to
get a drink of water & to shut off my computer from defraging it when I
went to sleep and I decided to check my mail and here was your post!  So
when I wake up and I read this I'll probably laugh or be embarrassed due
to the lack of continuity or something like that.


Goodnight and look forward to all the answers to the world on the list
when I awake and can think straight.
