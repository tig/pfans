 Leonard,
I have a tech question concerning the Amsoil that you use.
In most technical stuff concerning the use of Racing old vs Standard synthetic,
Racing Oil is not recommended for street use because it doesn't have the proper
detergents etc.

Example from Redline Website concerning Race Oils:
"To reduce the chance of detonation, our race oils contain very few detergents
and are not recommended for street use".

What have you been told about using the Amsoil Racing Oil?
