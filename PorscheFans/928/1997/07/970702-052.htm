I've ordered the special timing belt adjustment tool (gulp) at a cost of
just over $400.

If any other list-lurkers out there are from the Portland area, and
want to borrow it, I'd be willing to lend it for a price...let's say $50
one-time fee, and you can come over to my place and borrow it as many
times after that, for free, as you want.

I don't want to make money off this thing, or even pay for it, but given
the price,
I *am* trying to offset the purchase price a bit!  Hopefully there's a
few of 
us around Portland who are also willing to try doing the timing belt
tensioning
themselves.  Mark from 928 Int'l says it's not too difficult, esp. on
the older cars,
and I *do* have the factory shop manual--so I'm going to be brave about
it.
