  Get a Century 1000STE.  It fits in the back seat of the 928 and
  has a five point harness which is more compact and much safer 
  than the types with the arm that folds in front of the child.  
  This seat will work until the child weighs 35lbs, at which point 
  you'll probably be stuck using a booster in the front seat (and 
  begin to hear complaints from your wife about how little room 
  there really _is_ in the back seat!).
  
  Porsche allegedly makes a car seat, but you could probably get a
  lifetime supply of timing belt changes for what the thing costs!
