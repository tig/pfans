This was written in response to some conversations regarding the GPR
complaint and various repeated replies:

I'm just adding my nickels worth of free advice, but it has been my
experience that the people on this 911 list are WAY too uptight about things.
 Members of the 928 list regularly joke with each other and post small
notes/comments to one another without problems.  On the 911 list if anyone
says anything that 2 people out of the 1400 members disagrees to they are
automatically labeled a "jerk," "asshole," etc.  I received innumerable
E-mails because of a joke that I posted a few weeks ago.  If me saying this
makes anyone mad then too bad, because I don't really care.  I joined this
list not only for information, but to get to know some other people around
the country, exchange ideas, and to share some knowledge with other Porsche
fanatics.  I suggest the people who are only on this list for the information
should find a mechanic or buy some service manuals.  Lighten up people, not
everyone is a computer genius, and even I didn't know that replying to all
would send my message the number of times as there are members of the list.
 I'm just glad that it wasn't me!  I'm going back to listen to some more
jazz!
