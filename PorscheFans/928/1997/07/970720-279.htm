Hi All!

Firstly, thankyou Vincent Soo for advising me of the list problem so that I
could resubscribe.

Howard Hill is contemplating having a keyless entry installed and asks if any
electrical engineers or folks with good knowledge of how this is done can
comment
on what they think are good questions to ask.

Howard, my business is the design, manufacture and installation of a vehicle
immobiliser and, as well as my own product, I sell a keyless
entry/immobiliser system and have fitted just such a device to my 928S.
There is nothing magic about fitting this type of device but the circuit
diagram sure helps a LOT when finding which wires to connect to. My question
to the technician fitting the unit to your car would be to ask if he has
done one before and knows the procedure because I bet that he hasn't got a
circuit diagram. Most alarm installers make their profit from the most
common types of car (Ford, GM, Toyota, Nissan etc.) and have a book
detailing the complete circuit diagrams of all of these types of car.
However, as I mainly deal in classic and sports cars, I hardly ever have the
circuit diagrams and the jobs take a long time to do properly. I know that
time is money, but I just can't let a car go out of the workshop unless the
job done is as good as if it was my personal car. Find out if the guy
working on your car can afford to spend quite a bit of time doing the job
properly.

Recent easy jobs:       Morgan Plus 4, Alfa Romeo Alfetta GTV

Incidentally, quite a few of my customers have requested that I remove their
pesky alarms and replace them with a simple but effective immobiliser. When
I remove those Cobras and Laserlines, the backup batteries have always
leaked into the siren unit and, in most cases, rendered them useless.

Did you know?   - A recent survey showed that 83% of cars stolen that had
alarms fitted,
                  the alarm wasn't turned on!
You know why?   - Because false alarms annoy the neighbours and are
embarrassing.
What next?      - Fit a PASSIVE immobiliser that disables your ignition,
starter and
                  fuel pump. (Passive means you don't have to do anything to
make it
                  effective! You can't forget to turn it on!).
