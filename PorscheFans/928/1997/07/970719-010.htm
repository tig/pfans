Phil thank you very for your prompt response. I have been looking long
and hard for some decent 928 sites and yours is an excellent one. 

As for my gearbox it has had about 265,000km and I did change the fluid
in it about 18 months ago (I was greeted with some metal shavings...) I
think it really is time for some work on it.

An interesting point about the clutch is that when it was last replaced
(nearly 3 years ago) the official service centre in Melbourne
(Hamiltons) insisted that the old style twin clutch plates and pressure
plate were no longer being made available. I was confronted with a
AUS$4,000 bill to convert my clutch to a single plater. I searched high
and low and eventually found that these parts had recently been
re-released onto Hamiltons' parts list. What's more when I rang parts
direct and quoted the part number they actually had the things on the
shelf!! You wonder who you can trust sometimes...

Cheers, Nick.
