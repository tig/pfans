Won't happen.

If they're in their patrol cars they'll just say they were on there way to
some official cop duty/job related B.S.

Next, if they are in their personal car then it would be prejudicial to
single a cop out and publish or air the clip.  Next, how do you and I know
that the  person truly didn't receive a ticket?  We certainly couldn't go
to the person and say prove it.  If you did in this sue happy country/world
you'd have a some kind of harassment B.S. against you and the station that
aired the clip.
