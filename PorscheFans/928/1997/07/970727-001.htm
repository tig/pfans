This is only a rumor and please note the 288hp engines were also 5.0
liter 32v V8's...  To verify the engine type, you'll need to be able to
decode it's numbers - so get one of those $9 tech spec books immediately
and start studying.  If you do find the S4 engined '86 - get it!  It is
a rarity, though some may argue against it's collectibility (not me!).
It would also make one hell of a sleeper too...

There are cases of cars being sold not as they appear ie.wrong engine
and/or incorrectly badged and this only adds to the confusion and
general warning of caveat emptor.  A knowledgeable buyer has a much
better chance of success so I think you're doing fine so far...

Good luck on your 928 hunt!
Phil
