Hi All!

Stephane Cyr is looking at buying a Porsche in the short future
and is not sure yet if it will be a 928 or a 911.  He asks if anybody
would tell him why us Pfans bought a 928 instead of a 911. Performance,
looks, dependability, quality???  He then asks if anybody knows about
any good books on what he should be looking for when buying a 928.

For my answer, I would say that I purchased a 928 because it is a very well


designed and engineered car. The 911 has to be seen as a flawed design as it
evolved from a mass produced cheap "people's car" that had no pretentions of
being sporty. The current 911's are a credit to how continuous development
can finally overcome flawed design but the 928 started on a clean drawing
board as the 911's successor and Porsche's flagship. Of course, the 928's
performance, looks, dependability and quality are all that you would expect
of a Marque such as Porsche. The best book that I have been able to come up
with is the Brooklands "Porsche 928 Performance Portfolio" which is stacked
full of old road tests from around the world. If read from cover to cover,
you will be surprised at what you will learn (not all correct though!).
Also, as previously mentioned on this Digest, the 928 is a technologically
intimidating car. It is crammed full of high tech things like cruise
controls and climate controls and fancy windscreen washers. Usually these
things don't work when you buy a second hand 928 and you either need
mechanical/electronic aptitude or money (or both) to get these things
working again. However, a fully functioning Porsche 928 can be spoken of as
"No Car This Luxurious Is As Fast and No Car This Fast Is As Luxurious".
