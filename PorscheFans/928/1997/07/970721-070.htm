 Pietro,
The 88 Club Sport (that you seem to be obsessed with lately ;) ) that Porsche
created was a noisy, rough riding car, admitted to by Porsche and everyone who
test drove one. Porsche spent a lot of time by deleting all sorts of things from
the car to make it a Club Racer, the net weight reduction for all of their
professional testing and engineering was only 175lbs and performance gained was
only 3 tens of a second in 0-60 . I can tell you how to lose almost that much
weight in less than one hour without "butchering" your car. Simply remove the
rear seats, take out the spare tire, jack, all of the tools, and all of the
easily removable carpet. Now drive the car around for an hour with the windows
closed and see how you like your new "tin can". If that is Ok with you, than you
can proceed down the long and expensive road to "Club Sporting" your AUTOMATIC
car.

Here are the part numbers you requested:

Front Shocks are 928.343.055.09  - availble from Porsche list $300 each
Rear Shocks are 928.343.051.17  - availble from Porsche list $300 each
Club Sport Spring Set ------------ -----availble from Porsche est $2500 set

GT camshafts:
Intake - Cylinders 1-4  #928.105.271.01 -- availble from Porsche list $1200
Intake - Cylinders 5-8  #928.105.272.01 -- availble from Porsche list $1200
Exhaust - Cylinders 1-4  #928.105.273.01 -- availble from Porsche list $1200
Exhaust - Cylinders 5-8  #928.105.273.01 -- availble from Porsche list $1200

Also needed are the special pistons for the GT est cost $3000

Don't forget the 2 Brain Boxes est cost $2500

GUESS WHAT, the GT engine is designed for a 5-SPEED ONLY, yours is an Automatic.

Last but not least the Sport Seats. If you can find someone who will  do an even
trade between plain old everyday 928 Power seats  ($2500 ea new) for the Rare
Sport Seats ($5000 ea new), let me know, I have a few Bridges and some land in
Florida I would like to sell.


Pietro I am not trying to piss you off , I am trying to keep you from making a
very lousy investment for just a small amount of gain in performance. If you
would just buy a set of GOOD chips for your car you would gain more than all of
the above combined, for only $300-$500.

If you really want to spend all that money for nothing , go for it. but I still
agree with everyone else that has responed to your "posts" for Club Sport" info.

GO BY A NICE GT AND CALL IT A DAY.

 Why do you think Porsche just made the Club Sport for only one year. What they
did was add everything back that they took away, and left all the good additions
and called it a guess what ....... GT.
