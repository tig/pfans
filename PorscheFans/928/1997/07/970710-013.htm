Actually it's pretty easy.  

Remove the airbox top and the driver side air tube.  Get a small cup or can
and hold under the master cylinder reservior where the tube to the clutch
master cylinder comes out:  gently work the tube loose and drain the
reservoir into the can.  Have a rag handy to mop up any spillage.  Don't
pull the tube off the clutch cylinder or you'll have a heck of a time
reattaching it.

Unplug the sensor wire from the master cylinder.  Gently pry the reservoir
off the master cylinder.  There are two places where it plugs into the top
of the master cylinder and you have to gently pry it off using a screwdriver
and your hands.  

Loosen the two brake lines (my car is an '84, there are two lines ... your
car may differ) and catch any spillage.  The lines may not come off without
bending -- so DON'T bend them.  Instead, unbolt the master cylinder from the
vacuum booster first.  Then, when you pull it off the booster, gently pull
the brake lines off the master cylinder.  

Replacement is the opposite of removal.  Be sure to replace the rubber
O-ring between the master cylinder and the vacuum booster (one should come
with your new master cylinder).  Also, make sure the old O-ring comes off
completely.  Part of mine actually stuck to the vacuum booster where I
couldn't see it easily.  If you have the master cylinder off for any amount
of time, I would put a cover or plug or something over the two open brake
lines and the tube feeding the clutch to keep dirt and "stuff" out.

You can buy a new master cylinder from Porsche ($$$) or from other sources.
I suggest you check with 928 International and Eurasian Parts, both in
California.  Both have 800 numbers and both are helpful.  (sorry, don't have
the phone numbers with me, but information (1-800-555-1212) sould have them).  

The manuals have a pretty good set of instructions and pictures. 

Good luck!!!
