928 Fans,

I've seen the posts on synthetic gear oil, and I thought I'd give it a try.
 Now that I'm about to change the gb oil, I have a few questions that I
hope somebody with experience doing this might be able to answer.

Is the gearbox oil reservoir separate from the differential reservoir? (It
looks like there are two different drain plugs -- I'm assuming the one in
the front is GB and the one to the rear is for the Diff)

If they are separate, is it OK to use GL-5 oil that says its not
recommended for limited-slip diffs?

What size is the Allen plug that drains the gb oil? (I'm guessing like
maybe 17mm, but I want to be sure)

What are peoples' opinions on additives to the GB oil (like moly or
teflon)?


TIA,
Paul Callahan
