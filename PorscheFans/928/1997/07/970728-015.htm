You take two 928s to an auction. They are twins, except one has a look-al=
ike leather dash, the other real leather. Thus one will stand up long ter=
m, the other will shrink. Which one will draw the higher bid, and by how =
much? Which one would you pay more for and by how much?

I have no doubt that after the leather one has shrunk, and the vinyl has =
not, which one would draw the higher bid. But what about when both reupho=
lsterings are new?

Have any of you seen look-alike leather, the latest and finest available?=
 I have not. Wonder how close it is to real.

My favorite reupholsterer says he would have to take the dash out to re-c=
over it. He can't say an exact price becuase he doesn't know how many hou=
rs to take it out and put it back. $1100 to $1200 in real leather. Anothe=
r $200 or so to do the console. I didn't get a vinyl price, but I may dep=
ending on what I can learn about resale and show value of look-alike viny=
l.

You either have to buy a half-hide and have it dyed, or find someone who =
sells leather already dyed to match. Try Universal in California. They =
advertize in Hemmings. I got some samples from them. The seats were not =
an exact match. The color was close but no cigar. Their leather actually =
looked a little better than original, because it had a more interesting =
grain. However, the dash samples were very close. Close enough, because =
you just about have to do the entire dash.

We are thinking about improving ours to show it. What do y'all think abou=
t recovering with leather for show, then protect the leather with a dash =
cap, removed just for showing?
