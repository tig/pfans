First off thanks all with info/ideas about my problem (I'm going to have to 
start paying you guys!)

I figured before I did anything I would check the brake fluid level, it was 
ok.

Then I thought I would check the actual clutch pedal area, but I had to take 
out the shelf under the steering wheel and the driver seat to do so 
comfortably. Aha! the rubber boot on the rod connected to the clutch pedal 
going into the cylinder (master?) in the firewall had slipped off of said 
cylinder. (sorry if this sounds really wierd but if you haven't noticed I'm no 
mechanic =)) So after some rather ignorant fiddling the rubber boot finally 
went back over the cylinder.

Now the clutch feels much better, except for when I first start it in the 
morning, the clutch still feels a little sticky, I'm guessing that to much 
fluid had already leaked out of the cylinder and I'll need a new one. Is this 
cylinder self contained? or is it fed fluid from the brake fluid.?

Side note: When I removed the driver's seat I noticed 6 wires going nowhere. 
My seats are not powered so I have no idea what these are for except for one 
which is labeled AMP, so I'm guessing that once upon a time there was an amp 
under the seat but I see no signs of it (screwholes or any other mounting 
hardware) Don't you just hate wires lying around that aren't serving a 
purpose! I was going to take them out but they go back into the dash and it 
was really hot here, close to 100, so I decided this was a job for another 
weekend!

Stay Cool!
