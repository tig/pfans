My '84 928S upper control arms need rebuilding. Does anyone know where to
have this done, or is it $500 each at the dealer because the bushings are
worn and ball joint boots torn?

The auto trans in this car (93K mi) seems loose, particularly in 3rd and 4th
gears.
Specifically, the engine drops to idle speed when the accelerator is released
under 45 MPH in 3rd or 4th - little or no engine braking. If left in second,
the engine speed is tightly coupled with road speed, regardless of MPH or
RPM. Is the trans toast, or can it be readily fixed or adjusted? I,m going to
pull it, anyhow, to replace the converter seal.

Any advise on fixing the sun weathered leather dashes on these cars? Mine is
all cracked and shrunk, particularly around the defroster vents. Do the dash
caps advertised by Automotion and Performance work well? My intent was to
pull the dash and replace the hardened leather with vinyl. Any thoughts on
this?

My car is "Hellbronze" color. The stock disk wheels are finished in the same
color. I think it looks a little too Las Vegas. Is this stock?

My idea is to strip the wheel paint and polish the disks. I've done this
successfully with 911's; does it work with the 928 forged disk wheels? Are
these wheels originally painted or anodized?

Thanks in advance for thoughts and comments.

John
