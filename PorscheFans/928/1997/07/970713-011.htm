Hi everyone.

I am a Porsche fan who is considering purchasing an early 928S4.  I
currently own a 911 cabriolet which has been an excellent daily driver
and relatively easy and inexpensive to maintain myself.

I'd like to draw on your collective experience to better educate myself
on reliability and maintenance and of course those special "buying
tips."

I was employed at a Porshe dealership when the 928S4 was introduced.  I
attended the factory Product Knowledge course but have forgotten most of
what I learned.  I just haven't had the chance to use the info..

I do recall that the first few cars out of our dealership seemed to be
plagued by electrical problems.  What has been your experience?

I was told by a 928 specialist that if well maintained, the 928 motor
will outlast a well maintained 911 motor.  Do any of you have any real
life (preferably unbiased) experience to support this claim?

That's enough for now. I'd like to thank you in advance for your help
and assistance.

Andy.
