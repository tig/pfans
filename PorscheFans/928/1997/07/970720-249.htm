Leonard,

Thanks for the warm welcome in the midst of the list spam-storm.  I'll
call Autosport Designs this Monday to get things started.

Sounds ideal, I'm looking forward to it.

Yup.  I have to admit that my driver's ego is taking some lumps learning
the 928.  The tall gears and big engine are new for me, and I have to
pay lots of attention to drive smoothly at low car and engine speeds.
Getting into and out of NYC can be a real chore in stop-and-go traffic
on rough pavement.  Driving with more spirit (in the country) is easier,
though the shifter takes some getting used to.  And the redline comes
easily, which is pretty illegal in 3rd gear!

Yup again (grinning ear to ear.)

We seem to have the same model.  Care to comment on the ever so slight
enhancement?
