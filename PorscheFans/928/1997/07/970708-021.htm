If you look a few inches inboard of the rear shock mounts, on the
lip just behind the rear seats, you will find a hole, with
threads underneath it. At least it's there on several cars I
checked, including at least an '84 and an '88. Does anyone have
any idea what this is there for? It looks like a place to anchor
a shoulder harness (that's what I saw it being used for at
Watkins Glen this weekend), and it's pretty well aligned with
the seats (there's one on each side), but somehow I doubt
that it was intended for that. Using a single mount point
for both sides of a harness may be forbidden by PCA club
racing rules, I forget, but I wasn't going racing anytime
soon anyway. Anybody got a clue?
