If you're willing to learn from the Bimmer list, here's what they've
learned me.  Over there, we have an honest and straightforward
aftermarket retailer who supplies a lot of assistance to the list and
CCA members (Steve d').

The thing that you get by going with dealer parts is the assurance that
they've met spec.  You also get a 2 yr warranty(??).  The aftermarket
game is one of slim margins and the less reputable, of which there are
quite a few, won't hesitate at saving a few pennies on a part.  In BMW
land, some things that have hit US shores lately are defective
aftermarket guibo's (rubber discs that serve as driveshaft U-joints)
from India and brake disc retaining bolts with the wrong thread pitch. 
The reputable aftermarket people pulled their supply of guibos off the
shelf and payed the labor for their customers to switch out.  The others
didn't - the guibos would wear out in something like a few weeks and
it's a few hours of labor.

With an expanding PPE program and a 20% PCA discount, often the dealer
is close or even less than the aftermarket.  The discussion about
different clutch versions is another example where the dealer will have
the latest from Porsche whereas a less than reputable aftermarket
supplier may sell you an older variant (even an admixture we've been
warned).  If you really know what you're doing, you can save some $.  I
don't work on 928's everyday (just the same one everyday).  For some
things it's worth the (minimal) risk but for most I can't see going
aftermarket.

Best,
Kurt
