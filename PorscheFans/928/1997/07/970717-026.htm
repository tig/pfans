The shop manual should be available soon.  If not, maybe we should
mount a class action against Porsche as it is my understanding these
manual must be available IN PRINT to the general public BY LAW in the
US.  But I am not a lawyer and I want to make sure that I find a place
that will sell me parts down the road...

There are talks of manual on CD rom but that's all ther is, Talks.  One
must wonder if Porsche will take the time to scan the manual for the
older car or just issue the CD Rom for the new models.

In the mean time, the manual is available on microfiche.  Although the
quality of the picture is not very good (I am being polite), they do
have all the info and, when accompanied with the part microfiche, you
can always figure out what they mean.

The ideal solution would be for Porsche to publish a service manual
like Honda.  If you ever get the chance to look at one, do so.  It
contains every repair in good details and step by step instruction (good
for my limited mechanic skills), good diagram and a cost of < $60 per
car/model year.  They even have troubleshooting guide with thing like
test voltage a point A, if 0, change part, if 12 V go to next step...
