Sorry I'm delayed reponding to this post, but I've been out of electronic
touch for a few days.

Matt, I've been having more experience with the vacuum, cruise, a/c and
brakes than I can stand so I think I can answer your question.  The quickest
way to test is to take the check valve out and (pardon the expression) suck
on it.  Air should flow quite easily through the valve one way and not flow
at all the other way.  The end that allows air to flow through when you
apply a vacuum to be attached to the short hose that comes off the brake
vacuum booster.  The other end is attached to the hose that runs into the
firewall and hence to the heater flaps (this hose branches and one branch
runs under the fender to the cruise servo).  

The check valve on my car has a VW/Audi part number so it should be easy and
cheap to replace.  

My problem is that I've discovered a vacuum leak in one or more of the
vacuum servos that control the heater flaps.  Looks like I'll have to remove
the center console (not rocket science, just a pain in the rear!).

By the way, what are the symptoms you're trying to fix?

Good luck,

John
