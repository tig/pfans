Here are some excerpts from an email I received yesterday...

What not to say to a cop if you get pulled over...

- I thought you had to be in relatively good physical condition to be a
Police Officer.
- Excuse me, is "stick up" hyphenated?
- So, uh, you on the take, or what?
- Hi Officer, do you mind holding my beer while I find my driver's license?
- You know, I was going to be a cop, but I decided to finish high school
instead.
- Gee, Officer, that's terrific.  The Police Officer yesterday only gave me
a warning, too.
- I bet I could grab that gun before you finish writing that ticket.
- Hey, is that a 9mm?  That's nothing compared to this .44 magnum.
- Didn't I see you get your butt kicked on "COPS" last week on TV?
