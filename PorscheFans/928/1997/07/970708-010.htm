This was Marc's suggestion for the best chance of success and I agree.
I would really want PCA's involvement or backing and don't want to
'defect' so to speak - but it's been clear the 928 support has been
lacking even in the past.  Remember though, Kim is just one person!  I'm
sure he would welcome any help we could provide also as a switch!  BTW
you all are PCA members right?

I guess the big question is:  What are 'we' trying to accomplish by
organizing and what are we expecting from this organization?

Me, for one, would like to hear from Kim on a regular basis.  I've asked
him regarding the monthly (?)  article he writes up for the Nord Stern
Region newsletter but check it out:  as a service to us, if I post it to
my webpage, then it kinda' hurts Nord Stern's circulation at least for
the 928 owners.  But then most of us have never heard of them to begin
with and probably wouldn't pay dues for that region just to get the
newsletter?

And I don't want to impose on him to write a whole new newletter, adding
*another* unpaid task, since I'd rather he be out there cutting up the
tracks and competition in his 928!

I received similiar answers from other 928 authorities (remember they
are in business for a reason).  The most receptive so far to helping us
out is (natch!) DEVEK - Susan and Marc went so far as to agree to let
the '928 Owners Club' meet periodically at their shop for tech
sessions.  This does not mean we pick their brains and start grinding
our own DEVEK cams, or measure their cranks and go a drilling, mind you
- that wouldn't be fair to anyone.

Anyways, I'd like to see/have more 928 coverage, get together with other
owners on a regular basis, go racing with support, have instruction on
same but with a 928 specific instructor, and more!   This may mean
"asking not what the PCA can do for me, but what I can do for the PCA /
Subchapter 928" ie. writing articles for the GGR newsletter?  helping to
coordinate 928 events?  volunteering for miscellaneous tasks?

I've thought about speaking with Richard Gray, editor of the Nugget
(GGR's newsletter) to see if PCA would like to sponsor my website thus
relieving me of the financial burden.  Or an ISP or telecom carrier (hey
Madison, do you think your company would be interested in
sponsoring?).   I'd definately want to stay hands-on to continue to add
photos and hopefully info from PCA 'Corporate', all on a continued
'volunteer' and PCA member basis.

Anyways, this dialog should get more interesting soon when Ed gets
back...
