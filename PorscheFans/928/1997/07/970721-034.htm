Jim Stadter, Patrick, and Dave Cooley provided tips to change the
shifter bushing on top of the torque tube.  I just did it this weekend
and combined all of their directions (with a one or two of my own).

Another public thanks,
Kurt


These are directions for replacing the shifter bushing that=92s located o=
n
the top of the torque tube just behind bell housing (and engine).  The
directions are exact for (my) =9287 S4 (s/n 0181).  This is usually the
culprit in fore/aft shifter sloppiness (see Pano May =9297) although Dave
Cooley has noted that sometime the coupler just in front of the trans
can also be the problem.  The procedure isn=92t too difficult but you
can=92t be ham-fisted.

1.  Go in passenger footwell, remove the lower fuse panel (2 10 mm nuts)
and disconnect the O2 sensor (thick gray wire with black plug).  Push
out the grommet and wires through the hole in the tunnel.

2.  Pull up shifter leather boot - pull up the front of the plastic
frame and it=92ll snap out of the console.  Pull up rubber boot.  Look at
the shifter and memorize.  Remove the 2 clips and the shifter rod pins
and remove the shifter, springs, bushings, washers, and figure 8 piece.

3.  Support car on jack stands - no loss in having it high.

4.  Optional step.  Use a digital level to measure the position of the 2
shifting rod pins.  You could also measure the shifter before taking it
out.  (This is so we=92re sure to get the bushing spacing properly.)

5.  Remove Exhaust.  Spray 13 mm nuts to manifolds.  Place support
(jack) on cross pipe in front of rear muffler.  Remove 2 -13 mm bolts &
nuts on rear muffler, 1 of same on each intermediate, 17 mm center
support hanger behind the cat.  Remove the nuts on the exhaust
manifolds.  Lower rear a couple of inches, then remove the bolts from
the manifolds, lower the front while feeding the O2 sensor through the
heat shields.  (If you=92re near 60k, you might want to change the O2
sensor while the exhaust is down.)

6.  Remove the center and 2 front heat shields - 10 8 mm bolts total.=20
On the center, I removed the exhaust hanger to get it down.  Remove the
front tunnel brace to which the heat shields mount (4 13mm bolts).

7.  Pry the shifting guide rod cup off of the ball on top of the torque
tube.  I used a Stanley wrecking bar - the gently cured end.  Others
have used screwdrivers and motorcycle tire irons.

8.  Gently pull the shifting guide rod to the side and down - my went
more easily to the drivers side.  There=92s a bearing welded to the top o=
f
the torque tube (Jim Stadter) in which the guide tube rides and you
probably don=92t want to bread or bend this - just a guess on my part.

9.  Measure the distance from the cup to the rod and mark the
orientation.  Loosen the 17 mm locking nut on the cup threads.  How you
ask.  Well, you might try to put a 22 mm wrench on the cup to counter
hold the torque you apply with  the 17 open end wrench.  If you do,
you=92ll probably twist the cup right off the threads - you can guess why
you=92ve been warned.  I was able to grab the tube (back about 3") with a
"normal" pair of pliers and then squeeze those pliers with a channel
lock to get enough grip.  A channel lock won=92t go up in the tunnel as
the clearance is too small (the tube has to stay fairly high for this so
that the narrow part of the pliers goes where the clearance is the
smallest).  Unscrew the cup counting the threads.

10.  Put a little grease on the inside of the new cup and clean off the
ball.  Thread on the new cup the correct number of turns, orient it
properly, and then measure the distance from the cup to the rod and
adjust if you forgot how to count.  Snug the 17 mm nut.  Place cup on
top (DON=92T PRESS IT ON YET) of the ball.  Go in the car and measure the
angle of the pins/shifter or at least make sure things look aligned.

11.  Tighten 17 mm lock nut - it really doesn=92t have to be too tight.=20
Even if it does work loose, the cup won=92t be able to unscrew so I don=92=
t
see a big problem looming (YMMV).  Push the cup onto the ball (my guess
is the plastic will give more easily on a warm day).  I used the other
end (right angle end) of my Stanley wrecking bar by pivoting it against
a small piece of metal (aluminum of course) on the top of the tunnel.=20
Worked really nicely.

12.  Reassemble shifter.  The trick in putting this in is finding some
way to compress the springs so you can get the clips on.  The springs
fit tightly onto the shift lever so there=92s not a lot of room.  I
compressed the springs in a vise and then wrapped 4 turns of No. 26 bare
copper wire around the spring at 2 places.  Then install and cut the
copper wire.  Nylon thread may work (even dental floss) and, as some of
the copper remained, the nylon may be better here.

13.  Replace cross member, heat shields, and exhaust remembering to feed
the O2 sensor wires (and install the grommet) before the heat shields
are tightened and especially before the exhaust is entirely up.

Thanks to Jim Stadter, Patrick, and Dave Cooley for the tips they gave
in the above,
Kurt
