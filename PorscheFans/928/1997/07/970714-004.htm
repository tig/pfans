Kurt,
The 3 point or seat/sholder belts work identical to the original seat
beats
except for the addition of the third point on the "c" pillar . The reel i=
s
mounted on the outboard side of  the seat in the same location as the
standard seat belt reel. The belt then loops through the "clip" and goes
back to the "c" pillar attachment point. As you pull the belt around
yourself and insert the "clip" into the standard seat belt release/latch
on
the inboard side of seat, it becomes a shoulder/seat belt.

I hope this makes sense, for something so simple it is really quite
dificult to explain.

If you are speaking of the optional "child restraint seats" from Porsche,
the attachments for this are just behind the rear seats under the carpet
on
each side of the rear seats.

Hope that helps,
