Barry,
For what it is worth, Porsche now recommends MOBILE 1 (a while back they used
Shell Oil).
 Mobile 1 is what I am told comes in Porsches from the Factory, also of note
that is what they use in their Factory Race Cars (maybe or maybe not the same as
you buy of the shelf, but the same brand any way).

Subject: Best Brand Oil For 928s?



As a new owner of a creampuff 35,000K 90'928 S4, during my first oil change
after some 3,500 miles, I asked my Porsche mechanic which motor oil he
recommends  and why. He waxed most eloquently about the benefits of Kendall
20/50 as the best possible oil for the Pacific NW and for 928s. Of course,
it also happens to be the brand his shop inventories. But his bias might be
justified.

Any thoughts? Keep in mind the more mild climate in the PacNW area.
