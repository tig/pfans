Dear AQUALUX yachtsharing and charter,
BTW most of us are on a first name basis here, we are quite friendly ;-)
Yes, the american versions have this feature on S4s up till 90 or 91.(it 
was dropped by Porsche in later 928s, it was deemed unnecessary)
The flap system has a variety of system components and is fairly 
complicated. Get your hands on the Factory Workshop Manuals it has a step 
by step test and troubleshooting procedure for the flap system.
There is a relay in the central electrics, a brain in the hump between the 
passenger seat and door sill (beside the Stereo Booster), there is also the 
motor control module under the hood just in front of the radiator, on the 
passenger side of the hood latch assembly (black box with cooling fins on 
it), and of course the motor and linkage down by the flaps.
There is one easy way to test the flap system to see if it will open all 
the way, start your engine and turn on your A/C. This is supposed to make 
the flaps open to its full position.

Good Luck,
