I am in exactly the same position you are in wanting to upgrade the
safety characteristics of the car, because I am prepping for the
PE100.   What I've learned is that the 928 gets a rollbar exclusion
because of it's solid construction, at least in the 135mph speed class.
Regarding 5-pointers - Marc suggested I get Y-type shoulder harnesses
which would then attach to the rear seat passenger shoulder mount - my
car is a '90 and your car may not have those belt mounting points on the
sides of the trunk.  The lap belts mount to the stock lap mounts as
well.  That leaves the sub-belt to mount but it will be mostly cosmetic
since the stock seats have no provision for properly routing the belt in
the crotch area.   Again, these are only suggestions and not offered as
any recommendation on my part, proceed at your own risk.

!!! You need professional guidance here and need to contact your
preferred race shop !!!
At the least your local club should be able to help you out...

For fun browsing see www.bellmotorsports.com  and the Racer's Wholesale
which is listed on my website www.928s4vr.com.  They have an informative
catalog which we should all get for reference and future use.
