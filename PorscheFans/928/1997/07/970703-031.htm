Mike,
Got your response. Thanks for having a sense of humor. I was worried you 
might take my response the wrong way.

On a serious note , I have never seen a 928 that has not been scuffed up a 
bit on the bottom, after all some 928s only have a few inches of clearance. 
Your car should be fine, just keep an eye on the alternator and oil pan for 
awhile. Also if you notice on either side just behind the radiator you will 
see the large tow hooks with heavy reinforcement skid type brackets. That 
is why they are there.

As far as those "Stop Lamp Indicators", some are "glitchy" although on 
every one of my 928s it was dead accurate, when the lamp came on a stoplamp 
was out, or lost connection because of dirt, or corrosion.
Note: The "Stop Lamp Indicator" stays on until you press your brakes for 
the first time, that is how the system "Tests" the lamps.

P.S. Next time you get the urge to jump those speed bumps come borrow my 
CJ7
