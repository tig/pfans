Hi, Gang!

There's been a few articles lately referencing voltmeter/charging issues.
 I'm battling 'em too, and here's what I've found so far:

*   My local Porsche shop says that testing the charging ability of the 928
alternator ('78, anyway) should be done with engine at about 2,500 RPM.

*   They also said that the alternator, while capable of powering the
fully-loaded system, didn't leave a lot left to charge the battery.  The
owner's manual confirms this indirectly.

*   My Porsche voltmeter reads from .5 to 1.5 volts lower than an external
voltmeter hooked to the jumping post in the engine compartment.  While it's
supposed to be a 12-volt system varying loads, and the way the onboard
voltmeter is wired, account for the variance.

The bottom line for me is that my "around town" driving isn't keeping the
battery charged, at least during the Phoenix summer.  I'll continue to work
on this (attacking corrosion, bad relays, etc.), but right now if anyone can
recommend a specific "battery tender" that's worked well for you, I'd
appreciate it.

On another subject, they use photo radar a lot here in Phoenix.  It sticks.
 It's been challenged in many ways, and has stuck.  The bottom line here is
that the city/state governments, judges and law enforcement groups support
it, and so it goes...  Watch for parked sport utility vehicles if speeding
through Phoenix!!  Bon chance!
