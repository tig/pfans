Has anyone ever heard of someone tearing the driveshaft up in a stock
928S4?  Lucky for me mine is under Warranty...Almost 2K to replace.  the
actual shaft has long cracks and even a tear in the shaft right behind
the splines on the front of the shaft.  where the splines stop, there is
a clean break, viola,  two piece drive shaft.  The car is only a 90 with
52K on it.  It has the 4sp auto in it.  I have been having some strange
voltage problems also, I replace the $20 battery ground strap, and the
charging system works well now.  The strap looked fine, but after
removing it and testing it for resistance it registered a high level of
resistance for  cable of its size.....Strange.  Has anyone replaced
their muffler with what some of the performance folks call test pipes?
How loud is it?
