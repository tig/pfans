When he wired the amp, did he wire around the factory fader beside the 
driver's seat? If not, I suggest giving that a try. My '83 factory system 
expects a 2-channel amplifier to drive it and uses brute force with a 
front/rear pad to do the fading.

If your 4-channel amp was wired push/pull to get the most bang driving 2 
channels then its possible it doesn't like the load presented by Porsche's 
wiring. For example (I forgot if mine is like this or not, its one of those 
things that could change year to year) one side of the factory speaker 
wiring may be grounded, and your amp may be trying to drive ground, 
altering the apparent ground seen by your radio, and causing the RF 
interception problem.

When I replaced the junk Blaupunkt in my '83, I purchased a cheap ($200 
back then) Blaupunkt from Sears that "only" drove 25W into two channels but 
I retained the factory fader. Now that I think about that, my radio has to 
be running push/pull to run that kind of power without a power inverter to 
bost the voltage. Meaning my speakers can't be grounded.

Just guessing, but worth looking into.
