Farzaan,

Sory for misspeling yur nam 1outt oof thhe 2 tims I rote iit.
Of course no one on the internet mispells words, ever.
I assure you, it was not done on purpose or to disrespect you in any way.

Take a close look at my list:

>Vincent S.            5 days     Playschool Bike       2 days old

Can you not tell I was joking around.
I do not know how things are done on the 924-944 list but, on the 928 list
we are not uptight about anything but the occasional car problem. We all
seem to be able to send and receive humor quite well around here.

P.S.
