I doubt its the Valentine 1 that is at fault. Start with the ignition 
system. You might try using the Valentine 1 to solve the problem by rigging 
an extension cord for power. Then with your 928 running and the hood open 
move the Val 1 around, pointing at stuff under the hood. If you can point 
it at something that causes it to trigger, then suspect what you point at. 
Would start with an idling engine. Then only 2k RPM if that didn't work. 
And maybe gun it to 3.5k or 4k momentarily.

If you find the source is ignition, then try to isolate the cylinder.

Would expect the problem to originate in spark plug wires, spark plugs, or 
distributor cap. The sparks that jump from the rotor to the distributor 
cap, and the sparks that jump across the spark plug electrodes are full of 
RF noise. Nothing you can do will eliminate that noise, only shield it. 
Resistor spark plugs help but you've already got resistors in the Porsche's 
spark plug caps. You do have Beru connectors on your wires, right?
