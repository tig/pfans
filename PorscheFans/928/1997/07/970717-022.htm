Yeowch!!!  I'm not the email police, and don't know if Steve's response
was private to begin with, but either way that's not a real good way to
sell product IMO...  And now you see even if the original response was
private, it is all too easy for it to suddenly become public, thus
shooting oneself in the <name your own bodypart here>!

Now everyone's wondering " what's your response going to be  if I run
across trouble installing it / request a exchange / return / etc." ?
No, I think you just sealed your own fate by winging that deadly
boomerang out to begin with!

Ok, here's the porsche content or at least my take on it:

a.  I took the easy 15 minute route (well I did have to buy the GT first
though) and sawed off about an inch of the shift bar already (and no I
wasn't about to try to remove it first - but do try to have a second
person hold it steady/avoid undue pressure on the gearbox while you
saw).

b.  While I like the height, the throws still seem a hair long (but
perfectly acceptable).  Guess that's where all the revised geometry of a
redesigned bar comes in to not only lower the height but shorten the
throws?

c.  I first heard of a short shifter for the 911 years ago (which I
promptly bought both versions -  the glue/weld-on and the one-piece) but
think the idea first originated in Detroit or Los Angeles in the hot rod
days ie. Hurst.  In any event, the 911 short shifter tremendously
increased effort, although the throw to first was like only 1" and the
rest quite a bit more (but less than the almost bus-like stock
travel!).  Masochist that I am , I just lived with the increased effort
and funky shift throws.

d.  I would still like to be able to mount / change at will from the
stock shift-knob to an aftermarket knob(s)   (hey why not have multiple
knobs depending on event?)  and back,  and I think only the stock bar
allows that option without having to R&R the assembly each time?

e.  Jim didn't get the joke from the last go-round on this! (ie.
....requires some jim-foolery to properly mount aftermarket knob on stock
bar...)  (Oooh, another idea just popped in my head, and it's a good one
heh heh heh).

Be good to yourself and others,
PT
