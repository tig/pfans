I am hoping the dealer followed proper procedures to break-in the motor,
otherwise the rings and other components may not set properly.  Do you
smell oil when driving?  Is alot of oil accumulating under the intake
manifold?  Do you run at extended rpm's frequently?

In any case, I'm not the expert here and you should consult back with
the dealer (if that's who you prefer) or any number of shops ie. 928
International / DEVEK / et al

There are some GTS members on the list (at least before the email list
got fragged) so I'm forwarding to see if anyone has suggestions for you.
