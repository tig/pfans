On my 85' Euro car, I was just mousing around and saw that my temp sens I
(intake air sensor) was completely ripped off from the air filter housing.
I went down to Clair Porsche but they couldn't find it on the parts
microfiche, so I sat down at their microfiche reader and plugged in my
Workshop manual fiche and showed him exactly what it was. Upon seeing my
mworkshop manual fiche, he said, "wow, where did you get those, those
aren't supposed to be sold." I informed him that I, and the rest of us on
the 928 list, aren't your typical 928 owners, and we want *all* the
information we can get about our cars.

Anyway, back to this intake air tempature sensor, what effects does its
absence have on my engine?

My engine suffers from erratic startup/idle in cold weather, poor low-RPM
power, hesitation, etc. I don't think I've found all the problems yet, but
I guess this plays some minor role in my problems.
