<<P.S.S. What would you do if you were looking at a 928 to buy and pay top
dollar for and opened the hood and saw Cheap Aftermarket Wires, etc. on it?
  It would make me think the Owner did not maintain the car to the proper
factory standards, and took short-cuts wherever possible in its maintenance
and upkeep.  I would walk away.>>

I would agree with David.  Spend the cash for the OEM Porsche part- they are
expensive for a reason.  Buy the best- as you already have by choosing a 928.
 Depending on the year 928 you have you are driving a $50-$90,000 car, so why
put el-cheapo spark plug wires (or any non-Porsche parts) on it?  $175.00
every 5 to 15 years seems like a deal to me.  I'd sleep better at night
knowing my Porsche had all it's proper pieces on it... and no it isn't
"Corvette fanaticism," or whatever you guys called it.  To me it's respect
for a quality marque.  Just my $.02.

P.S. I laugh everytime I go to my local Porsche repair shop and see a Porsche
with hoses and other various important parts that were installed at the local
Marathon gas station.  No insult to anyone on the list, but if you can't or
don't want to afford the upkeep on a Porsche/Ferrari/Lambo/etc. then don't
buy the car.
