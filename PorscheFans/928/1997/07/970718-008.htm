Not that non-synthetics will cause your engine to disintegrate, but good
synthetics protect enough better to justify their higher price. They also
offer noticeably (to me, using Amsoil Series 2000 20W50) smoother running
and lower engine temeperatures.

Nope. I just looked in the shop manual, and it shows 20W50 as the
recommended weight for all but the deepest winter temperatures (constantly
below 5 degrees F) for all 928 models from 1980 forward.

See above. Synthetics are much more tolerant of low temperatures than
non-synthetics. I've never had a problem with congealed oil in the winter
here.

Thanks for the tip. However, there are lots more parameters of interest and
importance to specifying engine oil than are treated in that article.

>Red Line is THE top-performing oil available, period.

Not so, even though it's widely used by racers. Amsoil publishes the ASTM
four-ball wear test results for its Series 2000 and most other synthetics,
including Red Line, and the Amsoil product held the wear scar down to less
than half the length of the second-best (Mobil 1); Red Line was further
down the list.

Thanks for the disclosure. I'm not an oil dealer.
