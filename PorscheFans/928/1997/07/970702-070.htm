OK, I'll bite. This specification has three components.

First, You may very well have a system which produces an SPL of 128 dB
within your car, particularly with the windows shut (if so, please use with
care for your ears' sake). I remember seeing some early autosound
competitions/demos in the parking lot of the Las Vegas Convention Center
during some mid '80s CESs in which people were demonstrating systems
running upwards of 145 dB inside the vehicle (with windows open; deafening
from outside the vehicle at 50').

Second, it's hard to get more than one meter from a speaker inside a car.

However, the form of specification you've shown is for the practical
sensitivity of a speaker, showing the SPL at one meter for an input of one
watt. It's a big deal for a real-world speaker to come up higher than about
100 dB/1 W/1 M (most home systems are in the 80-90 range), and your figure,
taken literally (one of my specialties) suggests almost 1000 times higher
sensitivity. Either you've got a wonderful new product or you don't really
mean what you wrote (i.e., I'll bet it takes rather more than one watt to
get an SPL of 128 dB inside your car).
