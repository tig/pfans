I finally got to work on my turn signal switch problem today. My switch did
not return to neutral from left turn position. Since T&D had told me they
could not fix it through adjustment, I had gotten a newer used switch unit
from David Roberts.

I started taking things apart, and for a brief moment lost my good manners,
using quite a variety of German and American swear words: Why did they design
the instrument pod in a way that it has to be loosened and moved out of the
way to get the switch unit off and on the steering column? Why are these
screws so hard to reach? (And: how bad must it be to replace a headligt
switch?)

Anyway: I replaced the switch, wondering why the old one's return mechanism
did not show any signs of a defect. And voila (sorry, French readers: I can't
find the right "accent" on my keyboard): The new switch showed the same
problem as the old one did! I tried to adjust the position of the swich unit,
with no success.

Assuming the problem was not caused by the switch, I checked the steering
wheel hub:

The plastic piece that's extension should trigger the switch to go back to
neutral is mounted to the hub with 3 screws. When I loosened those screws,
the piece had some play. I moved it all the way to the side where the
extension is, tightened the 3 screws and put the steering wheel back in. 

Since then the switch returns to neutral as it's supposed to. However, I can
hear the plastic pieces of switch unit and hub scratch slightly when I turn
the wheel. I'll probably take the wheel off again, and add some graphite, or
make another fine adjustment.

What did I learn from this (once again)?
- pretty often a small adjustment and some patience can replace an expensive
repair
- the fact that a car mechanic can't figure it out does not mean it's
impossible
- those ingenious Engineers in Weissach sometimes do really dumb things
- driving a Porsche requires money or intelligence - both is best, of
course... ;-)

Hope this helps someone else saving the money for a switch unit...
