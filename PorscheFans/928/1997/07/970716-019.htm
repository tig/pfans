Gentlemen:

I hope someone has a simple answer to this problem:

I have an '88 S4 with very low miles (16k).  This has always had what
seemed like an extreme amount of 'slop' in the shifter fore and aft,
although not having had a manual 928 before I didn't know what was normal=
=2E =

Today while going from 2 - 3, the lever came straight back with little
resistance, the trans stayed in second gear!

I took off the shift boot and can see the front shifter guide rod moving
fore and aft which I don't think is normal.  There's a ball socket at the=

front end of the rod; it should only rotate.  Either the socket  come off=

the ball stud at the front end ot the torque tube, or something else up
there is broken.

Here's the dilemna:  There does not appear to be any way on earth to acce=
ss
that area of the car without completely removing the exhaust system,
including catalytic converters and down pipes from the manifolds.  I can'=
t
even see if anything is wrong without about 3 or 4 hours of removing part=
s!

Have I missed something really simple?  I'm sure by design the front guid=
e
rod (number 15 on p 34 - 8c of the service manuals) should only rotate;
mine moves front to back also.  I'm also sure there is no way to get to t=
he
offending area without a tremendous amount of work.  I'm not even sure if=

that's what is wrong, it can be fixed without taking out half the drive
train.  (I am really Cheesed!  This is a failure I expect on lesser
domestic jobs, not something like this!)

Any thoughts?

Jeff Seaman
