PLEASE HELP!!!! Sometime back I made a posting for various parts for sale.
One of the advertised items was a "grab bag" of 928 tools that I sold to a
posting member. Posting member, are you reading this?????

If you are, PLEASE look in the plastic bag I sent to you.  There was a part
that was NOT supposed to be in the bag - a BLACK PLASTIC 3 BUTTON POWER SEAT
CONTROL UNIT that is used in the drivers door for the memory system. Another
posting member has purchased it and I'm holding his uncashed check trying to
find it for him. PLEASE look in the bag and see if it's there.
Write to me please.
