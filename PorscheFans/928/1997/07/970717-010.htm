If any of you should buy anything from Performance Products (Van Nuys,
CA)check your invoice/reciept. The other day when I purchased Redline
Injector Cleaner the price on the shelf was $7.95. When I got the invoice
the list price was $7.95 but the extended price said $9.95. I think there
computer system is screwed-up. When I brought it to the clerks attention he
opened the catalog and stated that prices are subject to change without
notice (haha!). I told him that I was buying off the shelf and the shelf
said $7.95. So I got the manager involved and got a refund. I did not want
to argue over $2.00 but this is the second time their computer screwed up
on pricing.

REDLINE--------------------------------------------------------------------

My 1986 928s was running sluggish, I tried everything, Tektron, Castrol,
STP. The other day I went to Performance Products in Van Nuys to buy some
front brake pad and I purchased a bottlle of Red Line Fuel Injector Cleaner
and some Water Wetter. Both products worked just fine. 928 is running
cooler in the California heat. But what really surprised me was the fuel
injector cleaner "immediate results". The direction stated to pour into a
full tank of gas, well I had 1/2 a tank. When I  started the car with the
1/2 tank it hesitated, it was not getting enough gas, so I drove down the
block to my favorite Shell station and filled it with 93 octane, I hopped
on the freeway and "MAN" what acceleration. I am convinced now that fancy
labels and bottles do not always have the best products. I am about to
drain my transmission fluid and replace it with Redline Synthectic.  I am
amazed at how much smoother the 928 runs and how much better it shifts.

2-weeks ago I had the privledge of driving my bosses 911 Twin-Turbo, man it
is fast, so fast it almost takes too much work to shift it and enjoy the
ride, I found my self to fixed on the instrument panel and tryiong to be
sure to shift  without redling.

I  love my 928 automatic, all speed-no work. Can't wait until I drop in the
Devek 6.0
