Since they got blown off somewhere on 19th Ave!!!  (If you are offended
by street racing, delete this now)

I knew I had sealed my fate last week when I wrote someone the list that
this car hasn't been pulled on yet and that it would take a Stillen 300Z
TT to do it.

Well, guess who I ran into tonight?

Not Mr. S himself but it may as well have been his car!  Actually a
dual,  white car freight train crossed the intersection in front of my
headlights - a 300Z in front and an NSX bringing up the rear.  Curious
cat that I am I hung a left and caught up rapidly at the next stop.  NSX
in the far left, 300Z center, me right.  Given that this was a major
street, I let them squirt ahead when the light changed.  The NSX went
hells bells for the Golden Gate Bridge and appeared to stomp the Nissan,
or so I thought.

Not wanting to cross any bridges, I followed the 300Z now identified as
a TT, westbound,  stomping a mid-size BMW sedan (also white paint) that
for some reason was giving me chase.  Then the Z and I  played a medium
speed game of cat-n-mouse for awhile, jockeying for lane position ahead
of traffic.  In a deserted part of road we lined up again.  This was it
- showtime (again)!

Watch the yellow...it's fading, rev up, dump it and GO!  I pulled him to
third before we slowed for the next light but noticed he never really
left my side - I starting thinking of long distance.  Whoops,
concentrate for traffic (none at this hour) and watch that damn light!

GREEN - GO!  I led but then amazingly he pulled ahead first one, then
two car lengths!  Third gear and it was three.  I wasn't powershifting
but he sure was as his third gear chirpie sounded good.  It was obvious
he would hold the lead.  At the next light I rolled down my window to
find out what the heck he was running.  Got enough time to hear pumped
turbos, something about 475hp then the light turned green and we went at
it again!

Score?  Z 2, GT 0!  Damn that car was fast!  We pulled off the main road
and parked to inspect each other's rides (we're both obviously nuts as
it's after 2am and don't know each other from Adam!).  The 300Z had a
twin-intercooled big turbo kit on it, complete with upgraded brain
controller and turbo timer.  You know, every hi-tech goodie possible
yielding 18psi of turbo boost!  I told him I was shocked to have been
pulled on like that by a 300Z TT.    His car runs mid -12's in the
quarter and he said he enjoys racing new 911TT's .

Man, what action - go for a week without driving, put some plugs in,
adrenaline rush time again!  No hurt pride here as he definately had
motor on me!  Plus he was a nice fellow - no gloating - even warned me
against running blue ions in SF as the cops always pull him over...

Some things never change!
Phil
