Problem:  Since I got the car, the engine has produced a bad vibration
at ~1400, ~2800 rpm. Certainly we're hitting a resonance in the car (the
whole car shakes) - the engine is exciting it at the rotation frequency.
(I used an Analog Devices accelerometer chip to measure the frequency of
the vibration.  Neat chip!)

My speculations:  Certainly an out of balance flywheel or clutch
(pressure plate) would cause this.  I've had the clutch out and it
looked OK.  It vibrates independent of whether it's in gear or not,
clutch in or out - therefore I conclude it's not the torque tube, clutch
disc, or tranny.  (I'd expect a misfire to usually vibrate @ f/2 with
some multiples.)  Both of these really seem pretty unlikely (but that
doesn't prove they're not the problem).

?'s:
1) Anyone else experience this/what was the cause?

2) Does anyone have an old pressure plate for me to try a swap?  I'd
like to not have to buy a new one right now.  (New England would be
ideal.)

TIA,
