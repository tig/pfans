Consider yourself pardoned.

Phil, I've always enjoyed reading your site and your email contributions.
I also think of the 928 as the car Porsche intended as the successor to the
911.  Even Porsche can be wrong.  So I wasn't thinking of the 928 as a race
car (no race car could afford to be so heavy...)  I was thinking of the
epitome of the grand tourer; something with unlimited power and torque,
comfortable yet purposeful handling with creature comforts for daily
driving of any distance.

Let's open up the conversation.  Which after market shop makes the best
performing 928?

Cheers

Adam
