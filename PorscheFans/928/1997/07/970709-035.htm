<<Okay, Vince.  I've often wanted to take the nozzles out and clean them up
because one or the other is always getting plugged up.  How do you get the
nozzles off the hood (preferably without breaking anything)?>>

OK guys, my $.02.  I NEVER ever use my nozzles.  I have emptied both
reservoirs and don't even think about filling them up.  I'm sure that I'll
get a ton of mail telling me that my pumps will freeze up, etc., but the
solvent that is made for cleaning your windows also does a number on your
paint.  It's about the equivalent of waxing your car with a gas soaked rag.
 Have none of you ever noticed the streaks it leaves on your paint that DON'T
wash off? I'd rather replace a windshield washer pump (even though I won't
ever sell it) and have a beautiful factory paint job anyday.  Besides, if you
wash the car often enough and keep your windshield waxed (much cheaper and
easier to apply than Rain-X) the bugs and dirt won't stick.  Just a thought.
