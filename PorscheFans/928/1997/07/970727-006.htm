I'm definitely no lawyer, as a matter of fact I
<underline>love</underline> lawyer jokes.


However, owning a video production business and being a professional
photographer for 13 years plus, I have to be concerned with the laws
pertaining to videotaping or photographing people w/o their permission.


In a laymans terms if you are in a public place and are incidental to the
scene, and equally important is to not be profiting from the pics of
videos, then permission is not necessary.  Especially if your face is not
recognizable.  Your house is not public domain so that's why they need a
court order to "bug" or photgraph you inside.


I'm definitely not a cop either but I don't believe they need a court
order to have you under surveillance.  Again, unless they need to tap
your lines or bug your house they can do just about whatever they want. 
That's why Private Investigators can follow people without a court
orders.  As long as they don't interfere with you or take photos or
videos of you (and a *loved* one) out of the public area domain.


Another example is Photo Radar.  It's outlawed in a LOT of states not so
much for the privacy end of it, but because of as a citizen being cited
for a civil infraction you have the right to defend yourself.  A ticket
in the mail a week later gives you no opportunity to prepare a defense. 
Most often you don't even remember that you were actually going 135 mph
on this particular road at some particular time.  Also photo radar has
been know to issue tickets to dead people!  You know, family members that
don't change the plates or registrations after someone dies.  Ha!


So with this post, I'm opening myself up for some major debates or
flames.  But I let your post rest for over 10 days w/o any response from
anyone more qualified...like a lawyer or cop.


Personally, being the law abiding citizen that I am, I rarely do over 65.
 (Hundred RPM's that is!)


Hope this helps.
