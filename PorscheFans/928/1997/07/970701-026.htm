Hi All!

Someone has mentioned starter problems when hot and was given the advice to
check all connections. Good advice.

Stephane also commented "On my 85, I have a little red device that is
connected to my
starter. At first I thought it was from the *** PO but it I have been told
it is to
solve hot (or was it cold) start problem.  It was something like the current
does not
get to the starter when it is hot so this "bypass" provide the power when
this happens".

Stephane, it sounds like this device is just a "starter relay" that is
frequently installed by people who can't fix the real fault. The ignition
switch sends 12 volts to the starter solenoid which is a big relay (and
mechanical actuator). If the solenoid doesn't get full 12 volts, it
sometimes doesn't work too well and so a relay can be installed to bypass
this problem. My thoughts are to find out why the solenoid isn't getting 12
volts. Tne only time I would install a "starter relay" is if the ignition
switch was faulty and the customer couldn't afford a replacement.

Does this help to solve the original poster's problem?
