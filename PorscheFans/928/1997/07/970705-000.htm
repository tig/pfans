Colin,
If you listen/feel carefully to Trans when you first take off, you will 
hear/feel the 1st to 2nd shift almost immediately as you take off, 
depending upon your takeoff attitude. Once you are out of 1st gear the 
Trans will not go back into 1st until you stop. (unless it is modified)
 There is a good reason for this, Porsche determined that the auto Trans 
would not properly handle the great torque applied to the Trans in 1st by 
the 928. That is why it will not downshift into 1st (you will also notice 
if you wind out the car hard in 1st it will shift into 2nd at approx. 
4500rpm, whereas the others gears will shift at the redline if pushed hard

I have a "test" for you. From a dead stop pull your selector back to the 
"2" position. Now as you take off you will be in 1st, you should stay in 
1st until these 2 things happen:
1- You wind the car out to approx. 4500rpm at which time it will go into 
2nd
2 -You manually move the shifter up to "3" or "D" and it will then go into 
2nd and on to 3rd etc. depending upon your acceleration factor.

Have fun "locking" in that first gear at take-off and enjoy that rush.

P.S. Your sometimes disappointment with the "kickdown" switch is probably 
when you are in 2nd and nothing will happen, that is normal because you 
can't get to 1st until you stop again.
