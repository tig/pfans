<<Dreams are fine and essential things to have, and sometimes you want them

thing too. What do you dream about then?>>

I agree wholeheartedly.  I am 23 and couldn't regret owning two Porsches and
various other sports cars in my life more.  Wait, what am I saying?  I think
I've gone as crazy as the 911 and 928 P-fans list!  Seriously though, it is
good advice.  If you can't afford to keep up a Porsche then wait until you
can to buy.  Any Porsche is expensive to maintain properly, and you won't
find any people anywhere who want to see a Porsche not serviced and kept up
b/c of lack of funds any less than us.  Good luck.
