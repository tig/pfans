Neat trick! Thanks.

And I'm asking. Interested in all you can share.

Do you dehumidify your garage?

My wife drives our 928 to work 5 days/wk and parks it in the sun. Is ther=
e an easy off/on cover that covers only the top and windows?

You know what I think would be a big seller? A button you push and these =
window shades come up on the inside all around. Anyone know if there has =
ever actually been such a thing?

I read in popular mechanics years ago that someday the window panes would=
 be hollow and there would be this reflective liquid that would pump in. =
I see now they have the hollow panes in some new cars, but haven't seen =
anything about any reflective liquids. You?

Also, I like the automatic wrapper on the batmobile.

Once in a comic book this guy got out, pushed a button and his car shrunk=
.. He put it in his pocket.
