Got a decent fix for you:  use Zymol's HD-Cleanse product.  It's like
buffing, but
takes off the wax & the oxidized paint.  You MUST wax immediately
afterwards,
(say within a couple of hours) else the exposed, raw paint starts to
reoxidize.

I've had excellent luck with this product, and their waxes.  Price came
down
considerably after Turtle Wax bought the company.  Before, a can of wax
cost
me $40.
