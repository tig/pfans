Thanks to all for the help.

This post is about what else you think we better check before we drive =
it, and about how to safely jump
start a 928, and about how to redesign the wiring so that if you disconne=
ct the battery while running, you
don't hurt the alternator.

Re: WHAT ELSE TO CHECK:

So far, Byrne's garage is looking good. I telephoned them and discussed =
what all of you told me. They had
already checked the same, except had not disassembled the wiring harness.

However, Byrnes looked at the harness, and it looks good from the outside=
.. They, Byrne's, say that corroded wires will generally show as slight =
bulging under the insulation. Also, our engine compartment looks so clean=
, as does the underside of the car, that corrosion would seem unlikely. =


***Does anyone think that corrosion is too likely to exist but not show? =
Should we not
drive it until we disasseble the harness and see for sure?***

Patrick: what did your engine compartment and harness look like from the =
outside before you
disassembled it?

I am going to wait a few days more, to see what else someone may say. If =
nothing new to check on
comes in, then my wife can go ahead and drive her new toy. She does love =
it so!

Re JUMPING:

How to safely jump start with a dead battery without having the same effe=
ct as disconnecting the battery while
the engine is running?

Do you all agree that either of the two following procedures would not =
damage the
alternator provided the 928's own battery is chargeable? With both proced=
ures the idea is to have sufficent
charge in the 928's battery when the booster is disconnected.

1.  Leave the booster connected to the 928 battery for a while before try=
ing to start.

After the booster has been connected a while, disconnect it, try the head=
lights. If they are bright, the 928's battery must have accepted at least=
 some charge. Now you hope you know that when you disconnect the booster,=
 the 928's
battery should have enough charge to prevent alternator damage. Then reco=
nnect the booster, wait a while
again (to replace the charge just drained by the headlights (and to ponde=
r the cost of an alternator?)), and
start. Then disconnect the booster.

If  the headlights are not bright, try some more charging from the booste=
r. If you can't eventually get the
headlights bright when only on the 928's battery, better not start. Get =
a new battery or find out why else it
isn't charging, like maybe a short.

2.  Start as soon as the booster is connected.

Leave the booster connected a while after the engine is started, to, hope=
fully, put some charge into the 928's battery before disconnecting the =
booster.

Personally, I think #1, above, would be safer.

As for whether it is a good idea to turn on something for current drain =
before starting, I don't know. There is nothing in the laws of electricit=
y to prevent designing a circuit so that that would be a good idea. Howev=
er, the circuit could also be designed the other way: so that more curren=
t drain caused more damage. The latter seems more intuitive, but I don't =
have enough confidence in that intuition to bet an alternator on it. To =
be sure, I suppose one would have to study, and perhaps experiment with, =
the diagram and the specs of all the components, at least I would.

However, for what its worth, if I ever have to jump start my 928, thus =
I have to bet one way or the other, I will not turn on anything, except =
as described in procedure #1, above.

Re: REDESIGN:

As for putting in a capacitor, I concur that there are several ways that =
one can wire one in so as to reduce spike. But, wired in several other =
ways, they can be used to increase spike. Again, to know which, if either=
, would fix an '81 928 so that one could safely disconnect the battery =
while running, apparently would require some study etc.

Also, I am not sure that the damage to the alternator is caused by spike =
anyway. Patrick's alternator post was burned in two inside the case. Agai=
n, intuitively, that sounds more like a sustained current melted it. But,=
 too, a really high current spike could have done it in an instant, like =
a fuse. If it was a quickie that got it, one might have been able to hear=
 it pop. Anybody ever hear one pop?

Speaking of fuses, dare we hope it could be that easy? Just put a fuse =
at the alternator post?

I was hoping one of you already knew the redesign answer.

I can't help but wonder what the Porsche engineers think about all this. =
Didn't any of them ever own a 928? I have never tried to contact them on =
this or anything. Any of you ever do that? Anyone know how? Do they have =
an email address? Does one have to spreck-in-zee-dutch? I don't. Heck, =
I can't even spell it!

Thanks again.
