Hi Vincent:

Sorry I couldn't forget this part (on behalf of 928's) plus I love to
benchrace!  Ok, here goes.

Since I don't have a GN and note there's a whole bunch now in the city &
at Sear's I'm studying the competition.  The latest 'turbo & Hi-Tech
Performance' mag has a write-up on the '87 GNX - "Buick selected ASC and
McLaren developed upgrade to the GN."   "Buick's design goal was an
upgrade that would run a full second quicker 0-60mph than the GN.  They
succeeded without engine modifications (what?).  ... 547 were built..."
So that's my starting point (always go for top-of-line):

GNX Turbo  V6  276hp @ 4,400 rpm's;  360 lbs-ft torque @ 3,000 rpm's;
231 cu. in.  ('86 GN produced 235hp).  None of this makes sense so far,
especially that seemingly low hp figure and exaggerated torque!

"In '87, the Grand Nationals were tested by virtually all automotive
publications and averaged about 14.0 seconds at 97 mph in the quarter
mile and 0-to-60 times in the low six-second range.  The GNX tests by
ASC gave 5.4 second 0-to-60 and 13.47-second at 104.4 in the quarter."

So all things being equal (and stock, especially chips and boost) an S4
would be running nose to tail  with the GN (with the S4 getting the edge
only past the 1/4 mile) and the GNX besting even the GT by a few tenths
(given Car-and-Driver's 13.7 time) , which is also only a car length but
still ahead, at least for the 1/4 mile.  Ok, ok,  I conceed a very tight
victory to the GN or GNX but only up to mid-90 mph (you all know the
race is just getting started at that point, at least for me!!!).

The 928's roll-on figures should even the score in real world driving,
especially at triple digit speeds.  Humble pie doesn't taste too good
but looking at the photos of the Buick interior I feel alot better
now...

Grrrr!
Phil (now losing virtual drag races too???) (send your donations for the
6-liter upgrade to...)
