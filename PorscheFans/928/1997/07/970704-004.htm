Hi Khaled:

Thanks for the email and for being honest!   I will have to ask that you
not post pictures off 928s4vr.com as they all do not belong to me and
you'll have to get permission from the various sources for
web/commercial use.  As you know how much work and personal effort goes
into creating a website, I know you will understand...   I'll check out
your page tonight...

Start carrying a camera around and visiting events, you'll have plenty
of original material in no time!

Talk to you later,
Phil
