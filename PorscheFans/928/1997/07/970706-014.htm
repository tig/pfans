What an exciting time - pre-purchase!

And welcome to the list, your best source for first hand info and
experiences, parts, etc.  You'll see this is the most dedicated bunch on
the planet when it comes to 928s!  Searching the web is a great way to
get immediate information ie. www.classified2000.com, etc.   It is
recommended as St=E9phane mentioned to join your local PCA whether you
have a Porsche or not as this gets you access to newsletters, PCA
publications, events, etc. which will help immensely with your 928
hunt.  And there are some books which are a must-have for the 928 fan:
'Project 928',  '928 Performance Portfolio', etc.  One such booklet that
should be in your pocket when examining a car for purchase is the
Porsche Tech Spec book - it is available by model year / model so you'll
have to narrow down your purchase requirements, or, buy all the booklets
to cover the bases!

If you're in the area, please stop by DEVEK Performance in Belmont, CA
August 2nd for their swap meet/BBQ (as well as informal 928 owner's 20th
anniversary celebration/concours!) - you will see the gamut of 928s on
display - street , race, custom-bodied, stock, modified, early cars,
later cars, etc. and of course meet all the owners too...

Thanks all for the plugs on the page!

Phil
