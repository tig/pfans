Brian,
The HELLA H4 is definately the way to go. Pop in the 90/130 Watt Optional 
Lamps and you will see for miles.
I have been using them on all of my vehicles (except for my S4, of course) 
for over 12 years and given the choice would use nothing else The HELLA H4 
is a perfect balance of beam pattern, light output, reliability, and cost.
Beware, some of the "Aftermarket" companies that specialize in Porsche 
parts sell these for up to $300 a pair with the stock 55/60 lamps in them.
Check with some of the mail order companies in R&T etc., or better yet 
pickup a copy of a 4-Wheel Drive magazine (any of them), and you will find 
them advertised as low as $49 a pair plus lamp cost.
Watch it and don't flash your Brights with the "130s"  at the "Blue Light 
Boys", the H4s are legal for racing only.
