Yes, that's what I was trying to explicitly say - 4 bar at idle when
fully warm.

Thanks - I've gotten 5 responses so far - all echoing my most recent
observations (2-3 bar at idle when warm) so I think we're now normal -
well, in this respect.

Driver's ed - not racing, really.  I did have the car really warm once
before too at the Glen so it's not dead bang obvious - perhaps it was
the hot northeast weather or some combo thereof.

A few have asked off-line about the "package" specifics so I'll add what
I've written so that it's on-line too (for any lurkers wondering same):

There's really only one spring set made for the 928's - the Weltmeister
part # SP-9200 A & B (front and rear) which was developed by 928 guru
and racer extrordinaire Kim (John) Crumb and then handed over to
Automotion.  It is however available through other Pano advertisers.=20
Kim also recommends Koni Red adjustable shocks.  These have rebound
adjustment only and must even be removed to readjust.  The Koni Yellow=92=
s
are not made for the 928 AFAIK.  Early cars can accept Bilsteins and the
later cars came with factory Boges.  To put the Reds on an early car
that has Bilsteins, you need to get the later adjustable spring perches
(from Porsche, a 928 recycler, or the vendor selling the shocks).

In addition to some different factory spring versions, there are 2 other
aftermarket spring set-ups:  1)an older Weltmeister where you put the
stock fronts on the rear and get some stiffer fronts (recently sold by
Automotion for $99)  2) Devek coil-overs:  these are expensive and
prevent you from racing in PCA stock class as the rules presently
require you to use stock spring mounts.  They may however make your car
handle very well.  I haven=92t BTDT.

Typical good prices are $300 for the 9200 spring set of 4 and $130 each
for the Koni Reds + several hours of labor for install.  I think spring
rates are a progressive 450 to 580 lb./in. front and 300 to 350 rear.=20
These lower the car by about 1" but the increased stiffness seems to
prevent bottoming at about the same level as before.  The adjustable
spring perches can be used to then raise the car or further lower it.=20
When changing the ride height, it is important to reset the front toe-in
- the wheels will toe out as the car is lowered.  Negative camber will
also increase front and rear but rear toe should be unchanged.  After
replacing shocks and springs, it is recommended that you corner balance
the car.  This involves adjusting one of the spring perches so that the
weight on both front tires (and both rear) are nearly equal.

Thanks,
Kurt
