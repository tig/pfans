Yeah!  I'd love a new one!  With a scanner!

And you're right David - I have nothing to do with the porschefans
listserver other than being another 928 subscriber!  I don't even know
where the computer is!  (great trivia question though - I bet Leonard
knows!)

Also for the record, the same goes true for  928 International /
Automotion / DEVEK / Performance / et al  - I am just another customer
like you all and can/have taken my car(s) to other shops & mail order
companies  (ie. if you ever loose or break your aftermarket wheel
lock/key  while in SF - check out Ken's Tire and Wheel).

You already know who I recommend for smog testing  - J&S Automotive!
Fast, courteous and professional service - hell bring your Lamborghini
too ;)

Ok, enough plugs - here's one for the unofficial "928 Owner's Club" for
those of us on the list right now...(and those of us on the west coast
that is)

********************

1st Annual 928 Owners Club get-together sponsored by (and coinciding
with) DEVEK's open house/swap meet   Sat. Aug. 2nd in Belmont, CA .  Yes
it's the 928's 20th birthday too, give or take a couple of days!

8:00am - 11:00am
FREE 928-only  parking in designated show area (actually we'll park
there all day you just gotta' get in your reserved spot by 11am - I
encourage all owners of 928s early/late/stock/modified to join us!!!)
Please R.S.V.P. Susan Kirby ( DEV928@aol.com )  if you're bringing your
928 (and you better even if it's dirty!).  Watch your mailbox too for
the DEVEK flyer!

9:00am to 10:30/11:00am
FREE  928 Tech Session with Lucky Ekman and Marc Thomas!
Please R.S.V.P. Phil Tong ( ptong@928s4vr.com )  as your 928 O.C.
volunteer so I can prepare facilities for X number of attendees...

the grill!  (no host / no alcohol please)

1:00pm

that day (hint hint Philip E. ?)
Car show prizes (ie. by VIN, distance traveled, etc.) AND THEN (drum
roll please) by secret ballot --

3:00pm
928 Parade lap of Redwood Shores / Special photo shoot by the Bay
(?)...  Yes I hope all the magazines will be there!  Anybody know
someone at Guiness?  This is going to be the largest gathering of 928s
in the world!

4:00pm - ?
Clean up volunteers wanted!  Also, whoever's up for it, let's try to
cajole Lucky and crew, etc. into going out for dinner somewhere.  Hah!
Another 928 parade!  Hide your Vettes and 300ZX's for this one...

And don't forget the swap meet bargains you may find!  Hopefully we'll
see some of the folks from Carlsen Porsche, whose swap meet is the next
day, as well as the PCA "goodie store" booth- I need to fill in my
Up-Fixin collection and get some more stickers!  Hmm, maybe some advice
too on car prep so I can run in PCA classes also?

Have a great 928 Monday all.  .    .
Phil
