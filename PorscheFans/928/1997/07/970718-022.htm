Right on, St=E9phane (word order notwithstanding)!

The coolant in a car's radiator does not contact all the interior surface
of the radiator. Where it doesn't make contact, the little bubbles of air
are very good thermal insulators. So are the little bubbles of steam
resulting from local boiling of the water. The result is that only a
fraction of the radiator's surface area is active.

A surfactant (which, at least functionally, is what I also think Water
Wetter is) helps the coolant spread out and make intimate contact with a
larger fraction of the radiator's interior, increasing the live radiating
area and hence the heat flow out of the coolant to the air, thus lowering
coolant temperature.

If there were cavitation in the coolant, it would lead to the formation of
air bubbles, but I don't think this is where they come from in a real car.
Rather, there is some air churned into the coolant, and some more in
solution in the coolant, which latter comes out of solution as the coolant
gets hotter (the ability of a liquid to hold gas in solution drops with
rising temperature).

I have not yet tried Water Wetter, but have heard enough happy stories to
be interested.
