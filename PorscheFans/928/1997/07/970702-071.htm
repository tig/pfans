Hi All!

Michael Cottam says "I've got what appears to be an intermittent charging
problem.....I'm suspecting a loose exciter wire...but I can't for the life
of me figure out where the exciter wire goes from the back of the alternator
(it looks fine there)".

Michael, you have already had replies on this one and you may have already
cured your problem. For your info, the exciter wire supplies 12 volts to the
alternator (usually through the "IGN" lamp) just to get the alternator
going. Once the motor has started, the alternator supplies its own internal
source of voltage (through the field diodes) and the exciter voltage is not
required. Your problem doesn't sound like a loose exciter wire.
To recap and conclude this lesson, 12 volts (from the ignition switch) goes
through the "IGN" lamp to the exciter ("IND" or "D+") terminal on the
alternator which, with the alternator stationary, passes current through the
brushes and slip rings to the field coil. This excites the field coil. With
the alternator rotating, the field diodes rectify the alternator 3 phase
output and this voltage then excites the field coil. As we now have 12 volts
on both sides of the "IGN" lamp, no current flows through it and the lamp
goes out, indicating that the battery is being charged.

Brisbane, Australia is in the grip of Winter. 20 degrees C (68F) and sunny.
