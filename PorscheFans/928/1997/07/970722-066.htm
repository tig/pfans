Depends on the manufacturer.  For instance, Red Line's 10W40 will
provide better protection than a Castrol synthetic 5W50, and within 5%
of the high-temp high-shear viscosity of Mobil 1 20W50.  Red Line's
20W50 high-temp high-shear viscosity is about 10% beyond the Mobil 1
20W50.

If I were using a mid-pack synthetic, then yes I'd hold to the factory's
recommendations
precisely.  Although my 1982 owner's manual does recommend 10W40 up to
ambient
temps of something like 90F.  Here in the Pacific NW, you sure wouldn't
want to 
use 20W50 in the winter, according to the owner's manual--it gets WAY
too cold for
the range they show.

If you go to a higher viscosity rated oil, you're throwing away
horsepower.  Not a lot,
mind you...maybe 1 or 2%.
