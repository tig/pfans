Ok gentlemen (and ladies?)

I have been calling companies that I found in Hemming's motor news to
locate the 928 shop manuals (I know that 928 International has them, but
it doesn't hurt to shop around.)  So far, no luck.  I did find them on
microfiche for $85, but then I'd need a reader and a place to put it (in
short forget it...)
Anyway, then I found this .....guy (I'll be charitable...) who said I
didn't want these because they assume that the user has 2 things:  all
of the factory training (I guess they teach you to read there...) and
all of the factory tools.  So, he said get the Mitchell's books ($85 for
the 2 volume set).  How good can this be when every car from a given
year is shoe horned into these 2 volumes?  And how do they deal with
special tools?  "And at step 4 use a special tool from Porsche..."
Apparently, if you don't know the name of the tool, then you don't have
to use it! I'm sure Porsche doesn't rename every 10mm socket wrench as
something like P67798...I guess the guy wanted to sell me something
(even if they are good, I didn't like it when he said to me, "Now you're
educated.")

So what's the real scoop folks?  I don't mind spending the $$$ on the
real deals, but if the other one's will suffice for less money, then its
a no brainer.
