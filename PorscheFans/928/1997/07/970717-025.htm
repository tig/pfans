No no no. That's not flat like that to bend during an accident. That's one 
of the magic components of the 928's rear suspension. The funky links at 
the front are deliberatly designed to flex their "rubber" bushings and 
cause unnatural deflections. That flat part has to bend when this happens. 
Think it was written up in "Excellence Was Expected" the 928 engineers were 
unhappy at the thought of replacing their beautiful aluminum casting with 
an ugly welded steel part, but swallowed their asthetic pride in preference 
for performance.

Wait a second, exactly which of 3 or 4 "bolts" are you talking about. I 
just looked at mine. One possibility is the bolt closest to the flat steel 
you mention. Its the inboard pivot where it joins the big aluminum cross 
member. Shouldn't be much trouble to remove.

Another possibility is the very long shaft which the bottom of the shock 
absorber pivots. In an accident its quite possible this or any other bolt 
has bent. In that case its best to cut it. Or yank the whole assembly and 
replace everything.

Another possible bolt is at the front, its angled forward about 45 degrees. 
This is the magic flex joint of the 928. Don't mess with it. Disconnect 
from the bolt in front which attaches thru ears on the unit body.
