 Matt,
 Thats great news, sounds like Adam King's idea is the best so far.
 
 I would proceed with a total flush of the coolant system, and replace with a
 proper mixture (for your area) of "Phosphate Free" coolant and water, and
keep
 a close look at the coolant tank and dipstick for awhile.

I think that the PO had put in a product to stop leaks in the coolent system,
Bars Leaks if I remember correctly, but could the crud be left over in the
tank from the treatment. I am going to find Bars Leaks and see what it is and
looks like and compare to make sure, but I am going to flush the system to be
safe though.  Thanks for the help.
