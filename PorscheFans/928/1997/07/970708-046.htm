  If you decide to go with OEM wheels, you'll have to install the sensors
  since there will be two large holes in the rim of the wheel without
  them.  (I would not be tempted to follow a suggestion to weld plugs into
  the holes; the associated heat could cause irreparable damage or invisible
  stress.)
  
  As far as the usefulness of the sensors, other list members have complained
  that they are quite tempermental.  (I don't have any first hand experience
  with their functionality.)  Someone said they were $300 each from Porsche -
  $2400 for sensors - ouch!
  
  Wheel Enhancement (http://www.wheelenhancement.com/) deals specifically
  with Porsche wheels and will be able to answer your questions.  Others on
  the list have been pleased with purchases made from that company.
