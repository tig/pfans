Sounds a lot to me like you have a leaky clutch master and/or slave
cylinder. It takes a long time to leak enough to make a noticeable
difference in the brake fluid reservoir, incidentally. To check
the slave cylinder, go under the car, remove the rubber cap at
the bottom of the clutch housing, and run a finger around inside
there. It should NOT be wet inside there; if it is wet, figure
out whether it's brake fluid or oil, and act accordingly. To
check the master cylinder, pull up the rug and cushioning around
the little boot that surrounds the actuating rod from the clutch
pedal through the firewall; if there's any wetness there, it's
almost surely brake fluid. 

The slave cylinder is easy to replace, the master cylinder is
difficult because there's a lot of other stuff that has to come
out to get at it.
