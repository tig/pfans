Hello All!

I have a question for the the group.... I have a noise, an irritating
one, that I would like a second opinion on.  This noise is a chittering,
squeaking noise, sort of like a fan belt slipping, but it comes from the
back of the motor, at 2-3k rpm, no load, very little throttle, and is
worse in 2nd and 3rd.  When I press the clutch in just enough to bring
the T/O into contact with the pressure plate, the noise quits.  I fear a
torque tube is in order, but maybe someone has an alternate idea?
(please,please,please)
I have not taken the cover off the clutch or anything, I am just working
the suspension bugs out and sorting the mechanicals out after 3 years of
sitting, so this is sort of a "first volley" out to the folk here!
If there is interest, my "Euro-fied" motor runs Great!!  The car was
down for too long a period for me to say exact SOTP differences, but the
one I ABSOLUTELY can attest to is the free-revving ability of this
motor.  I give the credit to the MSDS headers and my nearly zero back
pressure system, IMHO, of course. 6k happens all too quick in 1st, so
much so, that I often short that gear by a thou or so just to get the
jetlike acceleration of second (and third) online sooner. I startled a
5.0 Mousetang today; I think he thought I was a 4-banger.  (I know...
small prey, but it is too soon on a new build to go wild)
Ramble,ramble,ramble....(sorry)

Oh, one other thing, if anyone is a wheel size/offset/diameter/tire
guru, will you e-mail me directly, I would like to pick your brain!!
Thanks!
