I've been reading the various remarks made by members of this group
regarding the relative merits of various types and brands of motor oil.  I
think that everyone involved should get a copy of the July 96 issue of
Consumer Reports.

They tested various types and brands of motor oil on a fleet of 75 N.Y.C.
Taxi cabs for two years and roughly 60,000 miles each.  Changing the oil in
all of them at 6,000 mile intervals.  Those of you who have spent much time
in N.Y.C. will appreciate the horrendous conditions the cabs there are run
under.  

At the end of the two years, they tore the engines down and tested them for
wear on the various components that would be affected by the oil.

Guess what they found!  Oil is oil is oil!  It did'nt make a damned bit of
difference whether it was regular or synthetic, cheap or expensive, one
brand or another.  There was absolutely no difference in any of the engines
with regard to lubrication etc.

All it really boils down to is big time advertising hype, just like STP was
for many years before it was discovered that the only benefit from it was
Andy Granatelli's ability to buy big yachts and winter homes in Palm Beach
or wherever.  

If any of you guys are putting eight quarts of synthetic in your beloved S4
engines at eight or nine bucks a pop, you'd be a hell of a lot better of
taking your wives or girlfriends out for dinner and buying your oil at the
local cut rate store.  It will be just as kind to your engines and may do
wonders for your sex lives.

I'm outta here until late August so don't waste your time flaming me, as I'm
leaving in the morning to drive my old S4 on a 4000 mile trip loaded to the
gills with cut rate oil. Which by the way, it has never burned a drop of in
over 90,000 miles.

Aloha
