It's neat to see so many people enjoying their youth.  I think of 
myself as a responsible, self sufficient adult, but I didn't want to 
get to 50 or 60 and look back and say "I wish I woulda..."

I'm 21. I was 20 When i bought my 78'. Cant say it was a REAL cheap buy
but I've always wanted one. I paid for it myself, I'm a computer tech and
can barely afford to support all my electronic habits but I set them
aside for a while to pay for the big toy. It needs a paint job and new
interior - but at least I have it. I will have before and after pictures
up (when there is an after, its still pretty much just a before)
