<<It all comes down to maintenance. If you like the car and you derive value
from the experience of being in it, you pay for that value by the decrease in
resale value as the miles run up and the maintenance and repairs which come
up with use. This is not the philosophy of a concurs competitor or serious
collector, but that of someone who wants to enjoy driving, the more the
better, and is willing to pay for that enjoyment.>>

I would have to agree with Leonard... keep your 928.  It may have miles and
may not be a 1997 model, but look at the type of car you could buy for what
your car is worth.  Now consider, would this new car be built as well as a
928?  Will it turn as many heads?  Will it be as reliable?  Will it be as
fast?  Will it be as exclusive?  Etc ad nauseum.  My 928 is an 87 and I don't
foresee any reason in the near or distant future that I would ever get rid if


it, not even for a 95 or 96.  I love the car, it is in beautiful condition
both mechanically and cosmetically, and I still get a thrill out of driving
it.  Keep your 928, update it with the money you would spend on a newer car,
and enjoy!
Just on man's opinion though.
