It's really, really easy.  Just make sure the car is jacked up LEVEL.

Nope, but you have to drain them separately.  I'd guess that there's
some
sort of baffling inside which prevents you from being able to completely

drain the front from the drain plug in the rear.  You fill both up via
the fill
hole in the rear.

See above...what is critical is to use GL-5 gear oil.  If you're using a

synthetic, use a less-slippery version such as Red Line's 75W90NS.

Pretty sure you're right.  You can reach far enough under the car to
test one while you're at the store (ask me how I know!).

>>What are peoples' opinions on additives to the GB oil (like moly or
