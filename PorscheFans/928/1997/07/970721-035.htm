Excerpts:

Red Line SuperCool with WaterWetter is designed to provide improved
metal wetting and excellent corrosion inhibition when added to plain
water or a glycol coolant. The most poorly maintained system in an
automobile is usually the cooling system. Maintenance is quite simple
and only required once each year, but most vehicle owners never
routinely change the coolant or replenish the corrosion inhibitors =
which
are required for trouble-free operation. Proper cooling system
maintenance is very critical for most modern engines which utilize more
aluminum. Aluminum has a very high corrosion potential, even higher =
than
zinc, which is very widely used as a sacrificial anode. The only
property which enables aluminum to be used in a cooling system is that
it will form protective films under the proper conditions which will
prevent the uncontrolled corrosive attack of acids or bases. Poor
aluminum corrosion inhibition will cause the dissolution of aluminum at
the heat rejection surfaces, weakening the cooling system walls and
water pump casing and weakening the head gasket mating surfaces. These
corrosion products will then form deposits on the lower temperature
surfaces such as in radiator tubes which have very poor heat transfer
properties, causing a significant reduction in the cooling ability of
the entire system. Red Line SuperCool will provide the proper corrosion
inhibition for all cooling system metals, including aluminum, cast =
iron,
steel, copper, brass, and lead.=20

Water has twice the heat transfer capability when compared to 50% =
glycol
antifreeze/coolant in water. Most passenger automobiles have a cooling
system designed to reject sufficient heat under normal operating
conditions using a 50/50 glycol solution in water. However, in racing
applications, the use of water and SuperCool will enable the use of
smaller radiator systems, which means less frontal drag, and it will
also reduce cylinder head temperatures, even when compared to water
alone, which means more spark advance may be used to improve engine
torque.=20

DYNO TEST RESULTS

Dynomometer tests performed by Malcolm Garrett Racing Engines showed
significant improvements in coolant temperatures using SuperCool. These
tests were performed with a Chevrolet 350 V-8 with a cast iron block =
and
aluminum cylinder heads. The thermostat temperature was 160=B0F. The
engine operated at 7200 rpm for three hours and the stabilized cooling
system temperature was recorded and tabulated below:=20

                                          Cooling System Fluid
Stabilized Temperature
                                          50% Glycol/ 50% Water	228=B0F
                                          50/50 with SuperCool	220=B0F
                                          Water			220=B0F
                                          Water with SuperCool	202=B0F
