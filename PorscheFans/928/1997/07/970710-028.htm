Okay everyone it's not too early to start getting the car ready for
August!

It's been awhile but I got to spend some quality 'DIY' time with the
GT.  Wheel locks installed and lugs torqued to spec - check!  I couldn't
resist taking the strut brace off (boy is it lightweight!), stripping
the paint and polishing it to a chrome like finish!  So I won't win any
concours for originality - it still looks great...  Stuck the required
N.A.S.A. stickers on the car too since I'll be heading back up to Sears
soon.

I now have 1k miles on the car and you know me, it's time to change the
oil!  I was using Castrol synthetic but has anyone seen that DuraLube
commercial with the breaker-bar and run-with-no-oil tests?  Kinda' makes
me wonder about all this.

Other thoughts:
Cheap wires - don't do it except for absolute emergencies only!  I tried
a set on the '84 and the fittings, etc. were so poor in quality and
impossible to crimp properly I threw it all away in disgust.  If you
recall, I ended up using a custom made set by Magnecor and they are a
quality set, excellent boots and shielding.  Again, no concours points
for these racing wires but that wasn't my intent. ( I agree too that if
you were buying a car and saw the PO put crappy wires in that you should
walk. You don't know what other corners were cut...)

Also, I would *probably* stick with factory wires for the 32v cars as
the environment is much more severe vs. the 16v's  ie. location, bends,
possible interference with Motronic operation.  (just watching the tech
smog the car by placing a Star Trek like device (NO clip-on inductive
lead on plug wire #1) on the INTAKE MANIFOLD to read the timing pulses
convinced me of the possible sensitivity of the Bosch electronics).
Unless of course you're entering a show and MUST have
pink/green/whatever color wires!  (no kidding)


Timing advance - I think we got confused over cam timing vs. ignition
timing and yes the mod is in regard to advancing the cams on 32v cars!
16v cars you're on your own, a degree or two might make a hair of a
difference for improved low-end, sacrificing some on top.   This is a
pretty common mod on other cars, although for the 928 the work required
vs. benefits gained might not be worth it on a casual basis but I
haven't any dyno info to go either way on this.  It is cheaper than a
chip or exhaust change though but screw it up and you'll be in deep
shizola...  Stick with your K&N filter, at least it'll take alot longer
to wear out the engine ;)

Ignition timing advance 16v cars only - since these aren't computer
controlled it is a piece of cake to do this but be conservative because
you do NOT have a knock sensor like the 32v cars and you can't really
feel the onset of detonation until it is too late already.  Let's say
you have a specific purpose in mind for advancing like racing, in that
case you'd better still stay conservative and run gas boosters as well.
FWIW I've read that 100 octane unleaded race fuel is now available at
selected gas stations.

YMMV remember proceed at your own risk!  If you tune/modify for racing
conditions, remember that you're trading component longevity for
immediate thrills.   That's why race cars get torn down and rebuilt on a
regular basis!  We're very lucky Porsche did so much extensive
design/dyno/test time on the 928, but we've all seen what happens if the
car is neglected too!

Phil
