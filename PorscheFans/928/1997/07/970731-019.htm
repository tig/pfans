        Varrin:

Good questions.  No, neither the odometer nor the trip thingymabob work at all 
when the speedometer stops but both worked fine in the past when I could get the
speedo working.  The needle never registered erratically either - it either 
worked fine or not at all.  That sounds like a nice feature, though. (Sorry 
officer, I had to go 110 because my speedometer sometimes only registers half my
speed...)  Thanks for the input.  I haven't heard much from the list except for 
Mark Hoverson who has had a similar problem that turned out to be the wiring 
harness. It certainly sounds like that could be the problem.  I will forward his
words of wisdom to the list.  As an aside, my fuel gauge has always registered 
low when it gets about halfway down, especially in cold weather, but it went 
from 1/4 to 0 at the same time (I think) that the speedo stopped working.  This 
also seems like it could point to the wiring harness.  I guess I'll know if it 
is related tonight when I fuel up after work.  

Thanks again for the input.

Anyone else out there?

A couple of quickie questions...
     
Does the Odo and Trip work when the Speedo indicates 0??  And before 
it totally quit, did it ever indicate erratically?  Something to the 
tune of half your real speed?  I've had this problem intermittantly.  
So far it's been rare (only a half dozen times or so since I bought 
the car) and has always been fixed by resetting the trip...
     
I'd be interested in anything you learn about this or other list 
members' input...
     
Thanks in advance!
