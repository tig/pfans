None of the above; it just didn't occur to me to do anything other than
drain the dino and fill with synthetic.

Since I mixed new with old without benefit of flush, and remain free of
bugaboos, my empirical answer is no.

The results of the ASTM four-ball wear test for a number of leading oils is
shown in http://204.174.89.120/cworld/oiltech/ser20w50.htm, which also
gives some specs for Series 2000 20W50.

I can't find any on-line reference to Amsoil's older 20W50 formulation;
it's possible they're not selling it any more.
