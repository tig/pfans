Hi all hope you had a great 4th!

All during the weekend I thought about racing in the back of mind, as I
just received the Pony Express info pack.  This might not be a
possibility for me just yet for a bunch of reasons, even though I know
if I set
my mind to it I could make it - but would be too hurried?  So if you
all don't mind I'd like to think out loud here and maybe get your
feedback too:

1.  The entrance fee is $595 plus $50 practice/qualify run plus $39
mandantory club association fees.  Understandably this pays for a
standby  emergency ambulance for the whole weekend, and all the other
requirements for holding a road race where there are no speed limits for
some competitors ie. imagine cleaning up a 200+mph crash!  Like Jim sez
though that buys alot of school / AX time... or put another way, with a
few other like minded 928 fans we could rent out a track for ourselves!
(and if enough chip in, even get Kim out here!)

2.  For top-ending, the GT needs front-end work ie. new shocks
 and springs - it's not ready yet and the clock is ticking. 
(cash register sounds & clock sounds).  I know David has GT set for 
sale right now, but not sure which way to go ie. Eibachs/Koni's vs.
coilovers
etc.!!!

3.  I haven't sourced my helmet/suit/harnesses/etc. yet  (sounds of cash
register ringing!  Will rent the suit probably)

4.  It would also be best if I had some track time and instruction prior
to

5.  I'd also like a nice race bucket or two for proper anti-sub
harness mounting.  

6.  Will be doing the t-belt svc. next Sat. (and hopefully the diff and
tranny fluids as well - I still need to contact Red Line asap)

7.  TorqueMaster is cooking up a set of plugs as we speak - their first
ever for a GT...  So if I don't get to hit 160 on the road at least I'll
do it on the dyno for now and post the results  (THWAAAAHHHH!)

8.  The '84 928 S still remains unsold!  At this point the asking price
is < $8500 on my 'investment' of $14k  and I'll have to put it back on
classified 2000 and start running ads myself since the showroom has been
ineffective.

9.  Just paid the first installment on insurance for the GT - $1600/year
in
SF (plus the five other vechicles puts a hurt on the race budget)

Actually there's a ton of other stuff but those are the highlights.  I
still have this unsatisfied need for SPEED that can only be quenched by
running a 928 flat-out but at least there's FIVE road races
 planned for 1998!   Plus Sear's is always open wed. nights for
bracket racing... and there's an old score to settle ;) and some new
ones as I see more ZR's have joined in with NASA... (Jim / Madison want
to join in on the feeding frenzy?)

This is serious stuff and I surely don't want to push my luck (or the
navigator's if present) by rushing things.  I want to do this right and
will continue to prep the car as I can like I am trying to make it for
Sept. (in case I can!)... but at this point of having so much fun just
driving the car, I haven't even had time to put the new fangled wheel
locks
on I got from DEVEK!  

Sorry for the rambling, you know I am a nut!
Phil
