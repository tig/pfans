They could have treated the engine prior to removing the oil.  Some
slick treatment on the pistons and wall cylinder might enable an engine
to last a few hours I guess...

I have heard of the Castrol Syntec guy going from garage to garage,
trying to push their product.  The guy would drain the oil form his
cherokee and go for a spin with some member of the garage.  Then 
refill the oil and go to some other town/garage.  The guy never
mentioned how often the engine was changed in is "new" cherokee.
