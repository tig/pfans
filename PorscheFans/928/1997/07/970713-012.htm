Gentleman,

LL, leave it be.

First, it appears that we are being dropped by Porschefans just as we =
were dropped by the factory.   I have not received any lists since the =
8th.  Quite disturbing.

However, I hope that all of you have seen the world sports car race at =
Sears Point.  On the second lap on of the ferrari's put it of in a =
fairly big way.  No one hurt, however, I see that the Professional =
Sports Car Racing organization has seen the true performance =
capabilities of the 928.  The medical/emergency chase vehicle is a Red =
928.  Just like it used to be in F-1.  ( Note: F-1 now use Mercedes, as =
Bernie Ecclestone and Max get paid.  Porsche never paid F-1 to use the =
928, the Grand Prix Drivers Association paid for the 928's, it seems the =
drivers all agreed that it was the best vehicle to get the doctor to =
them.)=20

 I guess the point is:  if a drivers life is in danger, you had best use =
the fastest, most sure way to get to the scene of the accident that is =
available.  PSCR  chose a 928, even though it's out of production.   I =
consider this very intelligent of the organizing body.=20

Take care folks,
