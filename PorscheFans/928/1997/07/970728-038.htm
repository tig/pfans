Will:

You asked if anyone had trashed their electronics by jumping.  I have not=

done
it by jumping but have a much easier way! (It only cost me $1270 to
discover this so keep it quite.)

When the liftgate is open to work on the battery there are quite a number=
 =

of interior lights on.  These things draw a lot of current.  I was
disconnecting
my battery to work on the steering wheel - didn't want to ground anything=

out
and cause a lot of damage you know.  As the ground  strap came loose, it =

flipped up and scraped along the wiper motor housing causing quite a few
little arcs.  Guess what?  No more electronic ignition box!!!!  That
simple.

I've been told that using one of those real high current chargers that ha=
ve
a
'boost' feature to allow instant starting with a dead battery will have t=
he
same
affect.

Be extremely careful when fooling around with battery power on your 928.
