Welcome to the shark's nest!  This gets better too - have a look at
http://www.928s4vr.com - and all the 928 links, guestbooks, registries,
etc. - just for the 928 fan!

How about starting with a simple fluid change first.  This will allow
you to a) assess any metal shavings etc. to the drain plug  b) check
condition of old fluid which may not have been changed for years <and
probably pretty smelly too>  c) see if new fluid works wonders like it
did in my transaxle  d) at least get more acceptable performance and
save you $2k + on the rebuild / exhange process...  Do the diff and
trans and see how it goes.

On advice, I am using Swepco and this may sound corny but I felt an
immediate difference just pulling out of the shop and I wholeheartedly
recommend it.  I've heard both good and bad about Redline, and like I
said I only have direct experience with Swepco at the moment.

Check to see if your clutch may be causing or adding to your shifting
problems - it might not be disengaging fully?  Also, quite possible your
shift linkage and/or associated components are contributing.Believe it
or not, there are some performance 928's going back to the double-disk
clutch as it may offer improved stiction over the single plate but you
should consult with a performance shop ie. Devek for your particular
application.  Note also many racing clutches are of the double-disk
variety for that reason (but I don't know of ANY aftermarket pieces for
the 928 - but who cares, Porsche OEM is just fine).  My GT uses a GTS
single plate and while I find it's performance excellent, others have
commented on the sudden, grabby initial engagement (which I like since
it's so positive).

G'Day!!!  Write us back!
