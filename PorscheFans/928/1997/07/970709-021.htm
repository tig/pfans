Hello everyone,

	I was reading the post about the Lambo, and I have a few things to say.
Since I lived for some time in Saudi Arabia, I was lucky, and spent a lot of
time around exotic cars. Yes, it is true, there is nothing that would attract
people more than a Lamborghini Countach, or the Diablo.  People would drop
their jaws and women would actually be looking for the owner or driver ;) of
the beast. THEY WILL ACTUALLY MAKE A MOVE ON YOU! and trust me pals, i know it.
	Still the Countach is not a refined automobile, as you will learn after
some time in ownership.  It leaks oil for firsts, the mechanicals are not that
sound, and I don't really trust Italian build quality. My friends who owned in
their collections Lambos always complained about them. Add to that that their
drivability is not a thrill. At instance, the Countach at high speeds is a
national disaster area, and would take some skills beyond 170MPH to control
the car in cross winds and in maneuvers.  You cannot drive it often to enjoy
since it is so cramped in the inside, is hard to drive at low speeds, and is 
uncomfortable after an hour's drive (plus the engine noise!!!!). The Lambo is 
great for the show, but not for the fun!
	Ferraris are close, but ranka bit better in driveability. and would 
also attract people like nothing else.
	Last, but not least, I have got to say that the PORSCHE 928 is the best.
I have driven manual and auto S4, a GT and GTS (both in manual), those cars are
great. We've seen 175MPH + no problem.  The car felt solid, and stuck to the
ground like if glued. the build quality is without a question 1st class.
You can drive this car daily without a problem, just regular maintenance, and
with complete comfort and luxury. (just think about the difference in R&D
between Italian cars and the Porsche + Weissach Research Center). Their is
no comparison. The 928 will unlike the others deliver under all the comditions
(try to drive a Lambo in heavy rain or traffic jam, and you'll know what I am
talking about).  You can drive it daily.  Have a real luxury auto. Have a real
-dependable- Sports car.  And spend a lot less dineros in the long and short
run! the 928 is a bargain in my eyes.
	No, it won't get you as much attraction as the Lambo or the Ferrari,
but will get you more than enough. Then again, that might be a good thing in
the 90s. :)

928 is the BEST from the EAST to the WEST!
