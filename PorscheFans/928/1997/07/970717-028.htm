Hi Pietro:

Note the Club Sport was a Euro/UK model only.  Kim just did a great
article in the latest Panorama magazine (you are a PCA member right?).
If not reprints are available to all.  Another great source of info is
Performance Portfolio - which  I used as a source for my webpage.  All
928s are high performance cars, but many believe the GT was the most
'right' of them all - sounds, mechanicals, performance, etc. and I'd
have to agree.  But if you did manage to get a Club Sport in the US it
would definately be a rarity and sure draw at any show or event, at
least to us 928 fans!

Have fun test driving prospective cars!
Phil
