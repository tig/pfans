My question to 928 friends,  what's the real story here on belt checking?>>

EA,
The real story is every 15K miles the timing belt should be checked &
tensioned.  Many 928 owners don't perform this service as they should, but
according to my Porsche technician the 928's are very sturdy/reliable and
rarely have timing belt failures.  Just took mine in this morning for a 15K
service though- then it's back in the garage with it, plug in the battery
tender and put the cover on for another couple of weeks.
