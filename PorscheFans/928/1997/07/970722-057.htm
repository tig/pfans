 Derron,
P.S. This camera system is Wireless Video, which does not have to have film
reloaded. I think you know what that means, all cameras are capable of
zooming in and taking a still frame of you or your license plate at any
time, all the time.

Of course all we have to do is find out the frequency they are using and
built a "jammer" to jam the wireless transmission. Just remember this,if
they can build it, there is always someone who can counteract it.
