Hi All!

Jim Stadter recently said "The car never fails to start eventually, it just
tends to start when it is ready, not when I am!". This was related to a
discussion about his and my cars having intermittent starting problems.

My car has only ever done it twice and, when it is that intermittent, it is
hard to find the problem. However, I took my car to get a new timing belt
and it didn't want to start but came good whilst I was diagnosing the fault.
From then on, it was fine. After the new timing belt was installed, the
mechanic went to start the car and it just wouldn't. This time, it stayed
dead and the fault was traced to the distributor not sending out pulses
because the coil was open circuit. I brought the distributor home and pulled
it apart and found that the coil open circuit was in the actual connections
to the lugs on the bobbin. A touch of solder and all was well. Maybe Bosch
originally used some flux that caused corrosion over time, when they first
made the distributor. 

Maybe this could be Jim's problem as well.
