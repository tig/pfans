>>The other thing I want to point out is in an automobile, voltages vary all over the place. I have 13.8 or so in my fuse box. But only 12 or so in my instrument pod. Not sure where its going but as an engineer I can't say its unexpected. Also can't say my 928S's electrical system is healthy as it pulls almost 1/2A from the battery with everything turned off. I suspect my alternator. Will deal with it after the water pump. Will do the water pump after I get the transmission fully back in the car. Will finish the transmission job when I did the car out from the pile that has accumulated around it in the garage. Will work on that when I get off this d*mn computer and the 'net.....

For those who are having a hard time keeping a charge in the battery,
it would be sensible to check the drain with everything turned off.
It's pretty easy to do, since the battery ground strap is connected
to the chassis with a big wing nut. Just disconnect the ground strap
(careful, don't let it touch anything that might possibly be electrical,
acording to a recent posting) and reconnect it through a milliammeter.
Now, you have to figure out a way to do this with all the doors and
hatches closed, so you won't be drawing current for all the interior
lamps (or you can just get somebody to hold down the hatch lid sensor,
so it thinks it's closed). On '84 and earlier cars, about the only
things drawing power with the key out are the clock and the radio (to
hold the station presets), so 10 to 20 milliamps is reasonable. Later
cars have more and more digital stuff, which tends to need current
to hold state, so the numbers surely go up, but anything over 50
or 100 ma. ought to be viewed with suspicion. Aftermarket stuff
gets wired in weird and wonderful ways, so that should be the first
place to look for excessive consumption of current.

Of course most of the people who have access to a milliammeter
already know all this, and the people who don't know it don't
have a milliammeter, but I couldn't help myself.
