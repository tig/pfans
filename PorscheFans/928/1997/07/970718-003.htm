Cool!  Me too, I got a Shoei by mail order and it fits perfect - thanks
to Racer's Wholesale for being patient with me as I measured and
re-measured and re-measured! my noggin...  Don't know if you saw my
other post but even I hit the roof helmeted.  With the sunroof open I
can don/remove the helmet without having to exit the car so that's ok.

Another bonus is that in addition to the Shoei helmet sock, they
included a free AutoPro fleece lined helmet bag too!  To round out my
order, I got one of those FogCity shields.  When I rode my motorcycle
they were a must-have - absolutely no fogging no matter how cold the air
was, or how wild my breathing may have been while terrorizing the
turns.  And I had some left-over windshield tint, so I made a tint band
on the faceshield.

What kind of helmet did you go for Adam? Did it fit straight out or
require any fiddling?

Phil
