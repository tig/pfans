I hope no one is re-subscribing this poor fellow everyday.  That would be downright evil.   Hehehe

Porsches suck...alright...They just suck...They are ugly as hell and they
are

too expensive. Get a camero or something. I'm not trying to be a jerk. I was

put on this list and I want off. I did everything I was supposed to. I did

all that unsubscribe crap. I'm tired of those messages saying... to

unsubscribe... bla bla bla  It doesn't work. Alirght. Take me off the
list.>>

You are obviously trying to be a jerk.  I think you are doing it on purpose
and didn't in fact get accidentally subscribed to the list.  Besides, any
MORON with a "camero" or a "firrari" (whatever the hell those are) could
follow the simple instructions to get off.  

Any genius with a Porsche doesn't bother with the unsubscribe routine, he
simply filters your name from his email account.  If you really wanted off
you would be off by now.  Enjoy your games.
