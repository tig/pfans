|Does this label resemble the one on my webpage (see codes section) ?
|All the build labels I've seen were under the mat, or, in the warranty
|book.   Where under the hood did you find the label?  It's a white
|computer printed label, about 3" x 4" ?
|
Well it pretty hard to tell from the picture you have, but yes I think so. It's
a 4" x 3" label with kind of grey dot matrix priniting. There is of course one
in the owners manual also.
It is pasted under the hood next to the emmisions label. I assume your picture
was taken from the rear of the car which puts the label about where the "X" is
below? [crumby ascii pic]

|re: 2.75 clearance!
|Jeez, one pothole in SF and tons of stuff would be toast!  Let's see,
|that'd be:
|Actually there are driveways and even uphill intersections that could do
|this too - sometimes I have to tip-toe around here and it feels like I'm
|steering a bull around town!  (My front suspension is a little tired too
|so things should improve after the swap - cones, watch out!)
|

Oh yes, I am careful over incine changes too! The Factory gave the ground
clearance as 4" stock! I don't think the suspension upgrade lowered it more
than 1" though, it probably settles some after a while. I had to be very
careful from the start but with the Automotion springs I can actually cross
places I couldn't before as the springs don't compress as easily as stock.

I like the look though ;-)
