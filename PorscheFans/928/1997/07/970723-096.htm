I'm losing coolant at an alarming rate, but I don't see anything on my
garage floor.  I probably go through a gallon every 200 miles or so.

First thing I did was pay attention to the exhaust, but nope, don't see
any hint of white smoke.  Surely at that rate, I'd be passing enough
coolant into the engine to show up.

Absolutely no leaks around the radiator, rad hoses, or thermostat.

This happened to me. The exact symptoms you describe.  Very
maddening....
My car had lost the bracket that holds the lower radiator hose away from
the power steering v-belt at some point in time (po) and it had been
replaced.  The point is:  The v-belt had "notched" the radiator hose and
it would only leak under very hot conditions when the hose would
expand.  My car only got hot enough to eject fluid when I was roaring
down the road or stuck in traffic, so I never got to see where this
liquid was going!

<<head gaskets are not that tough, it just takes 3 months ;)>>
