Hi everybody,
A while back the subject of toy and model 928s was brought up.  It seems
that no one was able to find any decent examples of these.  Today while
I was at Toys R Us with my son I was looking at the Hot Wheels cars
hoping to spot a 928.  It's amazing, but I found one.  It is in a
Porsche "Gift Pack".  The gift pack is a cardboard container
(approximately 4in by 11in) with clear plastic on the front.  There are
5 hot wheel Porsches in the package.  4 911 derivatives and the 928.  It
is an early model with no rear spoiler or body side moldings.  The cost
of the pack was $4.99.  Although the color is not the same as my car, I
am going to put it on my desk to remind me what I am missing while I am
at work.  Has anybody spotted a model of the 928 anywhere?  If so please
let me know, I would love to build one.
Thanks,
Chris Trask

PS.  The box has a "collectors tip" which states that there are 3 other
928 Hot Wheels out there.  In 1982 one was released called the "P-928",
in 1984 one called the "Predator", and in '85 & '87 one called the
"Night-Streaker."
