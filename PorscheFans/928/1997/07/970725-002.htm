Hello,

I remember a week or so ago, someone discussed something about the shift 
kickdown button which is under the gas pedal.  I believe it contained 
something of interest to me, but I am unable to find.  I checked the 
archives and was without luck.  I would appreciate if anybody knows what 
day it was posted on.

If anybody can't find the post, here is my question:  I test drove my 
first 928S and it didn't seem to have any power on takeoff.  By the way 
this is an automatic with 82,000 miles.  It idles fine and when in park 
it revs up fine with no sputtering.  On takeoff, I could hardly break 
the tires loose.  I didn't know what to expect but I figured it could do 
more than that with ~240 hp.  Does the 16 valve engine not have that 
much low end power?  What would happen if you put the transmission in 
2nd and then punched the gas pedal, hitting the kickdown button?  Would 
it kickdown into first gear and stay in first gear until redline when it 
would shift?  I didn't experiment with trying this as I didn't want to 
wreck anything.  The transmission seemed kind of sloppy overall though.  
As it got warmer it shifted better but when it was cold the 2nd to 3rd 
shift was quite hesitant.  Would changing the fluid and filter help it 
shift better?  If I buy this car, I can't really afford to rebuild the 
transmission right away, so I hope changing the fluid and filter will 
help "pep" up the shifting.

I appreciate and comments and advice you all can provide.  Many thanks 
in advance.

Timothy Rabe
