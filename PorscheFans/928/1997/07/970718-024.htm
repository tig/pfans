 Kurt,
The motor mounts I replaced were on 2 928s (80 and 84). The 951 a got for my
girlfriend a few moths ago.had just been replaced by PO.  I have 2 brand new
motor mounts in front of me that are going on my 89 shortly and according to
Porsche tech updates and 3 928 mechanics(Porsche trained) they have a viscous
fluid inside(I have cut an old one open for my own knowledge) and are designed
to cancel out the inherent resonance  of the 928 engine at 1800-2200rpm.
