 928 Fans,
P.S. For all of you who are skeptical about Roy's and my opinion of the K&Ns,
here is a simple test:

Clean the inside of your airbox, then install your K&N filter. Drive around
normally for 1 week, then take a clean white cloth and wipe out the inside of
your airbox.

Repeat above with factory air filter.

You may be very surprised at the results.
