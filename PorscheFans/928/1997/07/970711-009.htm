928 Fans,

I just recieved this response back from K&N Filters concerning their 
filters possibility of passing more fine dust particles than factory paper 
elements.


Here is K&N's response:

HERE IS MY RESPONCE BACK TO K&N Filters:


John,
Thanks for the prompt response to my second e-mail message.

I don't think anyone is questioning that the K&N filters do not do what you 
say they will do. We are more concerned with the fact that they may not be 
doing what they should do, that is to not only enhance our performance but 
protect our engines as well or better than the factory air filter elements.

Believe me, I of all people have always had the greatest confidence in your 
products. I not only use your Air Filters in all of my vehicles, but I also 
use your Oil Filters on most of my vehicles. Also until now I have always 
been the first to recommend your products to other auto enthusiasts.

Concerning the amount of questions in my e-mail , there was and is only one 
question.

Do the K&N filters allow more fine dust particles to pass into our engines 
than the factory paper elements?


Please let me and the PorscheFans know of your findings in this very 
disturbing matter of the possibility of your air filters allowing more fine 
dust particles into our precious (and expensive) Porsche engines than the 
factory paper element filters
..

Sincerely Yours,

David Roberts, President
MULTIMEDIA INNOVATIONS, Inc.
