Subject: Fuck off . . .

You don't really think we did this on purpose, do you?

This is exactly the sort of response I would expect from 
someone of such
incredibly low intellectual prowess as NOT to know that it 
is the mail
server that is causing this problem -- not us.

Eat as much shit as you can possibly stuff in your fucking 
head (which
should be a lot -- you seem to have quite a bit of 
available empty space).
