To the Porsche 928 Crowd,

Someone (possibly a friend) posted a writeup I did on the Lamborghini
Countach to the 928 list a few days ago.  Please note that I posted this to
the Ferrari list and didn't intend this for the 928 or any other car list.
In fact, I no longer subsribe to the 928 list since I sold my two 928's
some time ago.  I don't mind someone sending this along to other car lists,
but it's important to understand were I intended this writeup to be
discussed and debated.

It's a little unfair to bash away at my dreams on your list when 1) I
didn't post to your list, and 2) most of the comments are presented in a
forum in which I can't defend myself.  That said, here's a few added
comments based on some posted responses:

The Lamborghini Countach, like nearly any Ferrari, can't be justified by
any rational argument as a practical or cost-effective automobile.  That
isn't the point.  The Countach is as much a hobby-car and emotional issue
as anything.  I've owned 928's.  They're great cars.  But I sold them for
Ferraris and Lamborghinis.

Exactly the point.  Driving the Countach is still an exotic experience;
driving the NSX and 928 were essentially like driving my daily commuter
cars.  Exotic doesn't mean better or worse, just something different to be
relished and enjoyed.

One motivation for my purchases was retention of value.  Let's see who's
cars are selling for what in 10 or 20 years.  My opinion is that the
Lamborghini has reached the bottom of it's market value.  This is supported
by the rising prices on older Countachs and Miuras.  I'll bet you can pick
up a good 928 GT for $10k in 10 years.  Similarly, NSX prices are falling
like rocks.  I figured I better trade my in while it was still worth
something.

><In my judgment, build quality is superior to the Ferraris I've seen and

Much better in my opinion.  I've owned two 928's (1978, 1982 S) and both
had considerable problems compared to both the Countach and the 1977
Ferrari 308 GTB (70k miles) I have.  The electrical gremlins in the 928's
are well known.  I'll still take a good carbed car over fuel-injection for
the home mechanic.

Note this comment was with a helmut on.  Without a helmut, the Countach is
fine.  And, I've had similiar (but not as severe) problems with helmuts in
the 928.

>12 cylinders, 6 carbs.  Simple?   Give me 8 with fuel infection.

Yep, simple.  No complicated emissions.  One carb throat per barrel.  With
a working knowledge of Webers and a set of mercury sticks, tuneups are easy.

Yes, it is.  A similiar description of the workings of the Bosch K- or
L-Jetronic in the early 928s would be considerably more complex and beyond
the capabilities of many DIYers. I worked on and diagnosed a fuel/vacuum
system problem on my older 928, and found this job just at the limit of my
abilities.

This is out of bounds.  Liking and admiring this car has nothing to do with
maturity or age.  I said the *most* interesting fan was a nine-year-old.  I
didn't talk about the 70% of people who approach the car and admire it who
are adults.  My second favorite fan was an 80-year-old grandmother.

Don't thank me, I didn't post this to your list.  Enjoy the 928, it's an
exceptional car.  I'm certain I'll own another one someday, probably a
late-model GT or GTS when prices come down in a few years.  However, I
wouldn't class the 928 as a pure-bred sports car.  It's a GT, and probably
the best one ever built (maybe the Ferrari 456GT is better, but not on a
value basis).
