Vince, a long time ago, My mom had her car painted and there was some
paint left over (keep reading, this is getting somewhere).  The paint
shop gladly donated the remaining quart of paint because they said that
once the paint is mixed with the color (or some other additive) it
does not keep very good.

That was more than 10 years ago (or just about).  You might want to talk
to your paint guy to see if this is true or not.  It would be a shame
to buy extra paint for future use and realize it was no good when
you got to use it.

PS.  What kind of facility and experience do you have for painting car?
	just curious...

It really depends on the type and brand of the paint; urethane, laquer,
enamel etc. Some paint uses a catalyst to harden it and some don't.
Usually if paint is exposed to the air and heat, it will dry up.  I take
a piece of cardboard and cut it the same size diameter of the paint can.
Then I shove the cardboard into the paint can so that it will expell out
the air and slightly touches the surface of the paint.  I then place a
sheet of plastic (saran wrap) over the can before I pound the lid on.
If you store it this way, it will last a long time.

My first experience with painting cars date back in the hot roddin' days
and working part-time in a body shop.  No longer am a body man.  You can
rent a paint booth for about $50/hr. or call your local community
college's auto shop.
