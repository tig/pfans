Out here in B.C. Canada, young people rule the roads with shiny, flashy,
expensive machinery.  It is not uncommon to see E-class Mercedes being
driven by someone under the age of 20, nor is it uncommon to see highly
modified imports such as RX-7's Supras, etc.  

We have a strip of road that is the cruising strip and looking at the cars
show up is quite something else.  I think our area is only second to
the Microsoft infested area of Washington in the number of Boxster and
911TT sales.  Each and every day, my drive to work is only about 5-10km and
I will see at least a 911 C4S, Twin turbo or Boxster in only a short 
distance, and I don't work in downtown either!

Our autocrosses look like PCA events nowadays.  The group I race with,
called PDM Racing and TEAM ATL RACING have numerous big dollar cars
including a tri-rotor 3rd gen RX-7, an HKS modified Supra TT, a late
model 240SX with the japanese 2.0L turbo motor dropped in, a Civic with
a modified Integra GS-R motor dropped in, our two 944 Turbos with chips,
and a big, bad single turbo 3rd gen RX-7 which we hope will be very,
very fast when done.

If you want to see the cars in this area, check out some auto-x pics
at http://www.weissach.com/racing  Scroll down to the bottom and choose
the Kent or Bremerton events (Mickysoft area).

Farzaan.
