Porsche updated the Timing belt system starting in 89 with the addition o=
f
an "Updated Timing Belt pulley guide and cover" Part# 928.105.067.90.
According to information I have read, this revised pulley guide design is
supposed to reduce timing belt load and heat build-up that leads to belt
stretching and failure. This revised system can be installed in all 78-88
928s.

However, I would still play it safe and retension a new belt between the
first 1000-2000 miles.

The main thing that started the whole "Timing Belt" fiasco was due to the
fact of Porsche Dealers selling new 928s and telling the owners that thei=
r
first service was at 15,000 miles. At first no one realized that the belt=
s
would stretch so much when new (even the factory), thus the creation of t=
he
infamous timing belt problem.=20
If someone tells you not to retension your new timing belt until 15,000
miles, ask them if they will warranty damage to your engine if the belt
slips or breaks before you reach the 15,000 mile adjustment. I think that
their answer will answer your question.
