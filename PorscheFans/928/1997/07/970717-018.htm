First, Kendall is a pretty good petroleum oil, but no petroleum oil is
even in the
same league as even the worst of the sythetics.  Here, I'm talking about

resistance to breakdown, resistance to thinning at high temps/thickening
at low
temps, and friction.

Second, I'm nearly positive that the 928 shop manual calls for 10W40,
not 20W50!

A thicker oil might be called for in a HOTTER climate, certainly not a
colder climate
like the Pac NW.  For instance, on the Rally of the Lost Patrol (Seattle
to Inuvik
and back), we switched most of the cars to 5W30.

Sounds like your mechanic has been well sold to by a Kendall rep.

Check out comparisons by non-biased sources, such as:

Red Line is THE top-performing oil available, period.  However, if
you're trying to
save a few dollars a year, Mobil 1 is a pretty good oil (25% more
friction that
Red Line) for about half the cost.  Sugg retail on Red Line is $7.75 a
quart.

(I'm a Red Line Oil dealer as a sideline business).
