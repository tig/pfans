Hi Rodd:

When I first saw your email I was going to remind you to visit with us
August 2nd in Belmont, California - but now I see you're in Australia!

Tell you what though, we'll all keep an eye open for you at the swap
meets around here.  Philip E. found a pretty rare model that had roof
racks and ski sets.  Before anyone could satisfy their second thoughts,
it was in his possesion - you snooze, you lose!

I didn't even make it that far down the road - couldn't get past the
'shark's nest' we'd assembled!

See you later,
Phil
ps.  Do you build any models or car bodies?  I'd be interested in buying
an S4 body to put over my Radio Shack Wolf II RC car (almost the same
scale mph as the real thing!)
