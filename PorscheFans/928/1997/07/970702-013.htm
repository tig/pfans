>>and now i have one. 

Congrats!

>>What is the best Maintenance manual to have and where do you get it.

Bite the bullet and get the factory shop manual.  It's 9 volumes, and
proportionately
priced (around $300), but you'll save that back in the first little
problem you fix
yourself.  Got mine from Mark Anderson at 928 International.

Again, 928 International.  They've been really helpful, giving me great
advice on how
to go about fixing various bits and pieces, and their prices are better
than anyplace
else I've seen.  They seem to be able to get just about anything...my
latest project
was replacing all the gaskets and seals on the thermostat housing, and
they were
able to get the individual seals, reasonably priced, in about a week!
