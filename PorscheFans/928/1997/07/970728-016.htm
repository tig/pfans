Got it.  That makes sense.

Actually, I meant the bugs and the wire taps etc.  But what about LONG
lenses looking into your house from the street.  Is THAT public Domain?

Ok.  My question is this:  Would it be ok for the police to put a
surveilance system in a neighborhood that they decreed as bad?  They
could justify it by saying it was for the public good, but in my opinion
it could be and would be subject to serious abuse.  The whole absolute
power thing.  How does this apply to cars and automated ticketing? 
Well, I dunno, really.  It just seems wrong. If you allow one type of
camera surveilance then it seems that the next logical step would be try
to expand this type of surveilance to other areas of life (like the
above neighborhood camera thing...)  
A living breathing officer can take into account mitigationg
circumstances, whereas a camera cannot (in traffic situations that is.) 
Will it also take pictures of police who are speeding and send them a
ticket?  I doubt it.  They probably know where they all are anyway, so
they can pick and chose when they want to break the law (here in Mass I
always see Staties and city cops TEARING up 128 without their lights on
and I'm sure they're not all emergencies...)
