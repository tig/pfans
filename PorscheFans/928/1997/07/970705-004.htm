Ok, thats the risk I assume by not reading absolutely every posting to the 
list. I work in the midst of Corvette People who for lack of anything 
better to do spend lots of time on hunting for "original numbers" to match 
their project cars. And will actually have a chassis stripped and 
repainted, then attack it with a spray paint can to apply "authentic" 
overspray in the proper places. Needless to say, I didn't buy a Corvette 
when I wanted a play car. :-)

My car is an early '83, manufactured 9/82, I think. At 78k miles and 10 
years of age in 1992 the original wires were glow-in-the-dark junk. I had 
to cobble up a replacement wire or park the car until I purchased a proper 
set. And yes, I now have a set of Bosch wires on the car. These OEM Bosch 
wires are not silicon. And I don't expect them to last as long (or well) as 
a good set of domestic aftermarket silicon wires.

It all depends. I'd run away faster if I found SplitFires or Slick50 
stickers. If the original-style wire connections were not retained or 
emulated then I'd be concerned. In general after market wires wouldn't 
bother me much as not much harm can be done. Same for aftermarket speakers 
and radio. If its a tastefull installation, then its OK. But I'm not yet 
found myself financially capable of paying top dollar for a car. Bought my 
93.5 Infiniti G20 when I realized the dealer wanted to see me driving an 
Infiniti *much* worse than the Honda or Acura dealer cared. Paid more for 
my Infiniti 4-banger than the 928S, maybe that was a mistake.

I walked away from several 928's that had extra holes hogged out of the 
lower section of the doors for more speakers. My 928S had an OEM-like 
Blaupunkt, maybe it was the original installed by the dealer, but 
discussions on this list about *where* the amplifier is installed makes me 
smile. Mine was stuffed under the dash, above and to the left of the 
clutch. Held on with one screw. Wire connections were made by twisting the 
wires and insulated with cheap electrical tape. For all I can tell this was 
the original radio. Date codes indicate the radio was manufactured in 1982. 
And for what I can tell, Porsche didn't install radios in US-bound cars 
back then. Was told that everything added to the car at the time it was 
sold increased its value, and would be taxed additionally each year the car 
was driven. But if the dealer installed a radio *after* the sale then it 
didn't show on the vehicle's property tax.
