  Wait!  I don't _want_ my Temp Sensor II to be working properly!  That's
the cheapest part I can replace to fix my problem! :)

  You see, I've been chasing an occasional no-start bug in my car for
quite a while now and I think I've finally closed in on the problem.
Within a very narrow temperature span (e.g. engine temp 5 minutes after
a cold start with 80 degree ambient temp) the car will crank but will
not start.  While cranking in this situation, I do not hear the fuel
pump turn on.  Recently, I've tried jumpering the lead to Temp Sensor II
when the engine is in one of these no-start moods, and inevitably the
car will start after a few seconds (~5-10) of cranking.  At that point,
I'll shut it down, plug the lead back on to Temp Sensor II, and restart
with no problems (until the next time the temperature is "just right").

  So, I really wanted to be able to replace Temp Sensor II and be done
with this once and for all, but now you've dashed my hopes...

  Any ideas?
