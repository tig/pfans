I took the liberty of including this in a post.

On Thursday, I went to LRP with Northern Jersey and met list member John
(C. C.) White.  It wasn't until the end of the day that we both realized
we have been reading each other posts on the list.

On Thursday, had a good time - it rained for the first session in the
morning.  I was in the yellow group with an instructor.  It was my 6th
day at LRP but only my 2nd day that it was dry (and the first dry day in
the S4).  John was driving his =9284 S in white for the first time @ LRP.=
=20
Later in the day, I got fairly clear of traffic and John said my time
was about 1:13.  In the last run, I was dogging a 911.  I kept hitting
my line and he eventually early apexed west bend, I made sure I was on
throttle through the diving turn, and then he had to leave me by.  I was
running a little less than 1 s a lap quicker than he and so he=92d catch
me in traffic and then I=92d pull out a bit.  Great, great fun!=20
Afterwards, we found each other and shook hands and smiled a lot.

Originally the forecast was for Danny to deluge us on Friday but he went
out to sea!  Great day.  Again I was grouped in yellow but no instructor
this time (for the first time).  I managed to stage first and was
chatting with the Pit-Out flaggers who were watching the consistency of
one of the drivers.  We were talking about braking into big bend, lap
times and such, and they of course noticed I was in a (Guards Red) 928
which was the only one there on Friday.  I told them the time John
recorded on Thursday and I figured they=92d be timing me.  Well, turned
out the slow cars in the yellow group were slower than the green.=20
Moreover, there was one who was out to lunch and wouldn=92t wave me buy.=20
I finally elected to not be entirely polite - put the bug eyes up and
even <gasp> blew the horn down the front straight <grin - but generally
VERY uncool>.  He waved me buy but then collected every one else so I
had 2-1/2 clear laps.  It was the first session of the day but yesterday
was still very fresh in my mind so I executed 2 very good (for me) laps
in a row before I came up on the back of traffic again.  Then the
session ended.

After the cool off lap, I pulled into the pits and the flagger at
Pit-Out motioned for me to slow down (both hands "pushing" down) and
stop.  With a bit of that sinking feeling in my stomach (like when the
light bar lights up on the car right behind you) I stopped.  He (he=92s 6=
8
years old and a good driver BTW) came up to me and said "You=92re full of
shit!  You did 2 laps at 1:08 - you were going 135 (pointing at the
braking area for big bend) and had the tires locking under braking. (big
smiles on both of us by now)"  Well, truth be told, the speedo said only
125 but the tires (R1=92s) were at the threshold for most of the braking
(and I was braking at marker 4-1/2).  After parking, I went over to them
again to yak some more and he said very emphatically that I should go
see the organizers and get moved up to white.  Since I=92m still fairly
new to this, I wouldn=92t have done this on my own yet - I figure it=92s
much better to be faster than everyone else rather than getting run over
by them.  Nonetheless and I talked to the organizers (super nice guys)
and they immediately did it.  They were watching me lap too!  Sometimes
it=92s good to be the only 928!  The flagging assignment for me was
reworked very easily and so off to white we went.

Well, now for a run in white.  I=92m just a bit nervous - it IS my first
day without an instructor.  OTOH, I do know this track really well and I
always watch the mirrors (my read so far is that if you look and wave
by, no one will ever be upset with you for going slowly).  Out on the
track, no nervousness.  I=92m following a red 911 and had a great time
following him.  I could eat him up under braking for big bend but he was
just a bit quicker through the uphill, west bend, and the diving turn.=20
At first I was doing a couple tenths quicker than he on average and so
he finally waved me by at the end of the straight.  Right after this, I
was going too quickly into the right hander and turned in sharply
without throttle.  Back end stepped out, waited a tenth of a second or
so while counter steering, and then stood on the throttle to straighten
out the car.  This (appropriately) caused him to back off just a bit.  I
did some OK laps then and he improved a little bit.  Unfortunately, my
water temp was rising to just below the red zone so I waved him by and
started using 4th gear for almost the entire back section to manage the
water temp.  He pulled out a few seconds on me and then I went back to
using 3rd and we were turning very similar times.  Through the rest of
the day, had a number of these with other 911=92s, an M3, and a 968.  I
could out drag the M3 on the straight!  He was driving better and could
do more in the turns (about 0.5 s a lap quicker).  Similar with the
968.  Talked to a lot of these people after these runs - everyone
smiling and having a super time (well, there was ONE guy who wouldn=92t
wave anyone by - we went 4 wide on the front straight (while following
the rules and staying behind one another)).  It was fantastic - probably
8 cars running within less than 1 second of one another.  A lot of
people made comments about seeing a 928 go that fast.  (That was with me
driving - it=92d be great to see (ride with) Kim driving).

Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow and great to meet you John,
Kurt (very sore now - I need to get a harness)
