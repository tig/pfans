I don't subscribe to the "it has to be genuine Porsche Replacement Parts" 
ilk either, but as long as David Roberts and others are having fun doing it 
then the more power to them. I've seen David's monster Jeep, its nothing 
like his ultra-pure 928. Its obvious he has fun with his toys. Please, lets 
keep this civilized and not elevate this issue to the childish "matching 
numbers" rage of Corvette owners.

As to the spark plug wire issue, I spent a fair bit of time on my '83's 
spark plug wires before I broke down and purchased an "OEM" set from Zims. 
My original wires were so bad they glowed in the dark when the engine was 
running. One in partitcular was so bad that I had nothing to loose by 
hacking it apart to learn what was inside. Not much.

What I found was the original wires were plain high voltage spark plug 
wires, not the suppressor (or resistor) type. The spark plug cap contained 
the supressor resistor (forgot, but I think its 3k ohms). Guess what that 
does for Porsche? It means each and every wire has exactly the same 
suppressor resistance no matter what its length.

So I bought a set of "straight wires" from a perfomance shop. Bright yellow 
things. Cut to fit and install the ends yourself. About 2 hours later I had 
my first 928 replacement wire (only one wire, needs 8 more). Worked great. 
Ended that miss. One bright yellow wire sure looked funny but the engine 
ran.

What I did was to carefully work the compressed metal pieces off the Bosch 
wire, then recompressed them onto my new wire. Then the original resistance 
plug cap simply screwed back on. And same for the distributor end. If 
somebody with a proper metal forming shop was interested one could find a 
modest market selling these parts new to those who would build their own 
wires. I thought about fabricating something as a replacement but 
remembered one doesn't want to solder high voltage/high temperature wires 
like this. Was thinking about soldering a stud to the wires.

I'm of the opinion that Modern Good Old US Silicon spark plug wires are 
superior to what was used in Germany 10 or 15 years ago. OTOH, make mine 
black. Electric Yellow just doesn't match everything else under the hood.
