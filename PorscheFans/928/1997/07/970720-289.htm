  I wouldn't say that you should pass over an '85 or '86, but as is true
with most any Porsche, the later the better.  The '85-'86 years have a
288hp 32v engine wrapped in the early body style (i.e. less aero nose and
tail than an S4).  The disadvantage of an '85 through mid-year '86 is that
the car has a great engine but only adequate brakes for the power to weight
ratio.  The factory made a switch to 4-piston calipers in mid-year '86 
which are essentially S4 brakes.  If you like the early body style, one of
the late '86 models will provide _almost_ S4 performance for less money.

  Note that the brakes on the early cars can be upgraded to S4 specs and the
performance mods applicable to the S4 engine can also be applied to the '85-'86.
This might make the '85-'86 years one of the best 928 bargains.
