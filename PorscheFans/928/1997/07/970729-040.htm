When installing my rebuild 5-speed, got everything in place. And all but 
the last bolt in place. Found the driveshaft in the torque tube was about 
1/4" too far forward to insert the bolt in the clamp which connects it to 
the transmission. On disassembly had noted this bolt was loose. And on 
inspection am certain this junction has jumped its splines a time or two in 
the car's life.

The splines are ok, except for a little scratching where the bolt's threads 
rubbed.

Needless to say, I can't finish the job unless I can slide the driveshaft 
back a bit. Have started on disassembly of the clutch cover (this means 
I've been breaking exhaust bolts). When I get in there will I be able to 
unbolt the driveshavft and push it back a bit in the torque tube? Or am I 
in the market for a new/rebuilt torque tube?
