Lest anyone be having too good a day, read about my recent
disappointment below. (Read from the bottom message up. I'm not in the
mood to cut and paste...)




Thank you for your reply.

I don't quite understand how adding more wax will remove water spots
which are underneath the existing wax. The approach I have taken is to
simply wash the car often with lots of warm soapy water in an effort to
hasten the normal deterioration of the carnuba wax. So far, I have
washed the car about 8 times with standard liquid dish soap (since car
wax manufacturers typically suggest that this will destroy the wax
finish). I have also experimented with chemicals such as Bug & Tar
remover and pre-wax cleaners to no avail. I'm starting to think the
damage is pemanent (without having a power polish done, thereby removing
the uppermost surface of the paint).

It may well be my own fault for not paying close attention to the
directions, but the product has been portrayed as one which is applied
as part of ones normal car washing routine and, as such, would be
low-effort. I'll certainly pass this information along to my 2800 fellow
members of PorscheFans and strongly discourage the products use. It took
three months and six thousand dollars to fully restore the paint on my
Porsche 928 to better than factory condition, but only half an hour to
ruin it with QuickMagic.

Regards,
Bob Whiting
