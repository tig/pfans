Howdy guys,

I'm lurking over from the 944 list.  We just had our cars dyno tested
and we went drag racing.  I was very interested in the results you guys
came up with and will give you guys some idea of how much more the car
had in it.  I've been drag racing for a number of years with a best time
of 12.7 @ 107mph in an Eagle Talon AWD that was hopped up.  AWD launch
gave me a 1.70 60' time!

Anyhow, let's look at the time slip.  First off, that is a very impressive
ET and MPH.  I always tell first-time drag racers, "Many a dream gets
broken when the light goes green at the strip!"

R/T       1.030
60'       2.191
ET       14.245
MPH      99.324

I would be very interested to see your 1/8 mile time and MPH.  My 944T
with 15psi of boost (chipped) ran:

R/T      0.890
60'      2.379
330'     6.163
660'     9.252
MPH      80.07
1000'   11.864

ET      14.085
MPH     102.04

As you can see, your car pulls quite nicely for a 3800lb car.  My 944T
weighed in a 3230 with me in it.  My MPH was lower than it should have
been because I pulled a 3rd to 4th shift before the lights (stupid me!).
I was racing my friend's 944T.  He was at my tailights, then I shifted
into 4th and he pulled up next to my door!  If I hadn't I probably would
have run 103+ MPH and 13.9's.  My friend ran:

R/T      0.945
60'      2.264
330'     6.081
660'     9.148
MPH      80.60
1000    11.764

1/4     13.960 
MPH     103.34 

Now to decipher your timeslip.  The only things that affect MPH are shift
points and HP.  The driver has almost nothing to do with MPH.  I took
a street start launch on my second run and ran 15.377 @ 102.6 so you can
see the MPH will be +-2mph.  For each 1mph you want to go up, you generally
need 10hp in this weight range of cars.

The first 60' is everything in drag racing.  Being that we are turbo cars,
it's hard for us to leave the line well.  The best 60' time you can
realistically get in a RWD street tire equipped car is 1.950.  For every
1/10th you drop off 60', you multiply by 2X at the end for RWD cars and
3X for AWD cars.

So, theortically, your car is capable of: 2.191 - 1.950 = 0.241 X 2 = 0.482
Take your ET of 14.245 - 0.482 = 13.763 @ 99mph.  That would be the best
run possible in your car if the MPH does not change.

For the 944T guys, assuming a 103.3mph, the best ET we can get is:
2.264 - 1.950 = 0.314 X 2 = 0.628.  Take the ET 13.960 - 0.628 = 13.332.

For my car, it would be: 2.379 - 1.950 = 0.429 X 2 = 0.858.  Take the ET
and you get 14.086 - 0.858 = 13.228.  Notice how close the two 944T's
come even though they have quite different runs.

If you have any questions about drag racing, I'd be more than happy to
answer them.

I don't know about the 928's, but the 944T makes an awful drag car.
The first run of the day, I smoked the clutch right into 3rd gear.
That was not fun.  Unusually, the clutch hooked up fine for my only
really quick run.
