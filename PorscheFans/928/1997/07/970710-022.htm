 Michael,
 Porsche used at least three differant sized "Wheel Spacers" on 928s 
throughout the years that I know of.

 83-84 928S uses a 20mm slip on spacer with extended wheel studs. (Not sure 
about 85-86)

 88 928 Club Sport and 89 928GT uses a bolt on 17mm wheel spacer

 928GTS uses a bolt on 35mm wheel spacer

All of the above wheel spacers have the "middle raised centre "thing"" 
added to the exposed side of the spacer. I honestly do not know if the lack 
of this "lip" on your spacers would cause problems, but I would hate to 
that it did find out in a 1G turn at Mach Speed.

All of the above Factory Wheel Spacers are still availible direct from 
Porsche.

P.S. I have a used set of the "S" 20mm Factory Rear Wheel Spacers availible 
if you are interested.
