Hi All!

Kenneth Hartley has discovered that his plug wires are shot.
He is looking for facts, opinions, and any other useful
commentary, that this group might have to offer!!

Kenneth, I replaced my OEM leads a while back. The originals in my car were
wire leads with a resistor in each plug cap. I went to K-Mart and purchased
a set of generic "V8" leads for $39.00. These wouldn't fit into the unusual
connector arrangement on the distributor and so I jiggered around with a mix
of new and old parts until I got it correct, both physically and
electrically. I did a similar thing at the spark plug end to keep the
essential seals. All in all, I now have new silicon suppressor leads for
just $39.00. My local Porsche mechanic says that I will have problems, but I
can't see how or why and I DON'T have any problems! If I do, THEN I might
spend big dollars on some bits of wire and plastic bits.

Until someone comes up with a scientific explanation as to exactly why these
fancy leads are more effective, then I will put their "benefits" down to
snake oil (like Slick 50).
