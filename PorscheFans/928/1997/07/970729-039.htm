Lets assume the alternator and regulator are working correctly for a moment. But the battery isn't getting charged. The alternator can typically crank out 60A or 80A (didn't look it up just now) when running at full tilt. And the battery is 10' of wire away. My "e = i * r" diatribe was to demonstrate how high currents only require very little voltage to make a significant voltage drop.

If the portion of the regulator in the alternator where voltage is detected is accessible, then one can cause the alternator to correct for voltage drop betwen alternator and battery by extending the voltage sensor to the battery with additional wires. These wires don't have to be large, 16ga or 18ga would do, because almost no current will be flowing thru them, they will have little or no voltage drop. And the alternator/regulator would see the true voltage of the battery.

On the other hand, the stuff in the engine compartment will run at a higher voltage because its connected to the alternator, which is connected to the battery thru this suspect voltage drop. Ouch.

Lets look at another solution. If the alternator/regulator is working correctly and the problem is the huge wire running from alternator to battery then a solution would be to replace this huge wire. But there may not be anything really wrong with this wire, only that its minimally degraded and causes the charging system not to work. Another solution would be to run another huge wire in addition to the one which exists. This would lower the total resistance, and increase the margin of safty. Resistors in parallel add like this:

    1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 .... + 1/Rn

For only 2 resistors (and for those lacking 1/x on their calculators)

    Rt = ( R1 * R2 ) / ( R1 + R2 )

Where:
    Rt = Resistance total
    R1 = first resistor
    R2 = second
    Rn = last

Adding a 2nd wire of identical resistance will lower the total resistance to half. Even adding a 2nd wire of higher resistance will lower the total resistance.

Running heavy wires as described above is a pain.

While it sounds ridiculous, its not such a bad idea to run a ground wire from the battery to the alternator. While you have a huge metal chasis between the two, its not always the best. When installing amateur radio equipment in cars I always run power and ground all the way to the battery. At the radio and at the antenna, it also gets grounded to the chassis. A real ground wire to the battery prevents lots of little problems in the future. Oh, and fuse both ground and power. This is a good idea for high power audio stuff too.

The other thing I want to point out is in an automobile, voltages vary all over the place. I have 13.8 or so in my fuse box. But only 12 or so in my instrument pod. Not sure where its going but as an engineer I can't say its unexpected. Also can't say my 928S's electrical system is healthy as it pulls almost 1/2A from the battery with everything turned off. I suspect my alternator. Will deal with it after the water pump. Will do the water pump after I get the transmission fully back in the car. Will finish the transmission job when I did the car out from the pile that has accumulated around it in the garage. Will work on that when I get off this d*mn computer and the 'net.....
