Hello 928 listers,

I recently bought an '87 928 S4  5-speed, blue with gray leather.  It's
my first Porsche, so I've got some learning to do about care and feeding
it.  The previous owner advised me to join PCA, and to "find a local
guru" as soon as possible.  The car appears to be in excellent
condition, but it's time for 60,000 mile servicing, and I take the
"guru" recommendation seriously.

So, I'm in the market for a "guru," ideally convenient to downtown
Brooklyn or Manhattan, but I'm willing to suffer some inconvenience in
return for high quality.   And I'm interested in learning as much as
possible about Porsche "ownership without tears."  My PCA application is
complete, and this list looks like a great resource.  Any
recommendations for a "guru" or other hints would be greatly
appreciated.

The car is a blast, by the way.  But you all probably already knew that!

Phil Wilson
