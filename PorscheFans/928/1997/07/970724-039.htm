I'm sure they are, but the test itself is not (coming from the impartial
and respectable ASTM), and Amsoil seem to have included most of the "usual
suspects" and published the names and numbers. Red Line have done no such
thing, so there are at least levels of bias.

As you no doubt know, API and other impartial entities issue specifications
and the fat of a given oil's meeting a given spec is printed right there on
the (I guess you can't call that plastic jug a) can. The problem is similar
that with audio equipment, in that the basic specs don't tell the whole
story, leaving many discernible differences unmeasured.

I suspect that car makers, having compelled oil makers to show compliance
with the basic API specs, could do the same for more advanced test,
including the ASTM four-ball wear test. If the car makers are too timid to
do this, then the tremendous moral authority of the Porsche Fans 928 list
should certainly suffice.
