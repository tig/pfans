Just thought id let you guys in on my weekend nightmare, my water pump went
on the 1984 928s im driving, so before i did major damage i decided to
replace it, set the timing to top dead center and started to dismantel {
for those of you wondering i have my own repair garage} everything came off
real nice, when the tension was taken off the belt the cams spun a little
till they came to the closest spot of least preasure,{ normal} i didnt
bother to look for cam timing the crank was set to TDC so i didnt give the
cam gears any thought, while i was in there i replaced, the tension pulley,
some other pulleys, cam seals O rings, front oil seal, cleaned it up real
nice and started to re assemble, made sure the crank was still at TDC and
slowly timed the cam gears, now its all back together looks good,
averything was set up just right!! here goes !!
crank! no compresion crank, crank, SHIT! no compresion, man i trashed the
valves but how,no one come near me ill kill you!! im going home, next day
after, i re check every thing i first take #  1 spark plug out look for
piston position its about 3/4 off the way down
bring it up to top, but the timing mark is 8 inches away, what the hell, i
soon find out the harmonic balancer spun about 8 inches off so not only did
i not take the thing apart at TDC but i also timed the thing so far off
that now, i realy must off trashed it,
well set the cams for my new timing mark wich took an hour to find, and the
DAMN thing started right up { WHEW} man what a scare, well ive ordered a
new harmonic balancer, but from now on im checking cam timing to crank
timing even at disasembly!! just for you guys out there ask your machanic
to check, if your having one done you might not get as lucky as ME!

sorry to make this so long

Steve
