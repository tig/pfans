Ron,
Congrates on your bumper cover and your driving pleasure in the worlds best Grand Tourer .
FYI $200-$250 for a 928 rear bumper cover is the normal price on the market , you do not have to wait for the next swap meet to get a price like that.
For example, check out 928 International's Website and you will see rear bumper covers for $250 all the time.

I am not trying to burst your bubble, next time check out the 928 specialists first to get an idea of the pricing before you get caught up in the
feeding frenzy of a "swap meet". Plus as an added bonus, had you bought the part from one of the 928 specialists you would have supported the rare few
who try to support us 928ers. If we do not support them, WHO WILL. :-)

Just a thought,

David Roberts
