Bob, waxing your car to get rid of water spots WILL NOT work.  I have touted
Zymol products before and will do so again now.  They are expensive, but they
work.  Immediately stop using liquid dish soap on your car.  It is too
alkaline and will damage your paint.  Bug & Tar remover will remove the water
spots, but as you correctly noted, not until you remove the wax.  I do auto
detailing on top of the brokering and locating that I do, so my suggestions
aren't motivated by anything but experience and a desire to help you out!
 Buy the following products and use them in the listed order:
1. Zymol auto bathe... car wash concentrate
2. Zymol cleanse... paint cleaner and wax remover
2.5. Bug/tar remover if needed
3. Zymol polish... the only Zymol product you can buy at AutoZone
4. Zymol carbon or creme wax... depending on if your car is dark or light
colored

*Please note- although these products do work better than anything I have
ever used, be aware that no product works miracles.  Getting your paint back
in shape will take at least 7 hours of hard work.  Time well spent if you ask
me though.  Never use cheap products on your car (nothing with "Quick"
anywhere on the bottle), always read the directions, and always add in a lot
of TLC.  Good luck.
