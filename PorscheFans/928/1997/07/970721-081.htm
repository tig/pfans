Greetings from Japan,

OK, so I finally bought that 1983 European specs 928 Porsche and I've got
say man, is it ever a sweet ride!!  

I've also got some stupid questions that I hope someone can help me with:

1) What do these warning lights on the instrument panel mean?  I can't read
German.

Schlusslicht

Bremslicht

Wa. Wasser

Ku. Wasser

Bremsflussigkeit

Bremsbelag

Bremskreis

Handbremse

Delstand

2) After driving for about 30 minutes the red "!" light came on.  I wondered
if this was the low fuel indicator as I was almost empty, but when I filled
it up the light stayed on.  The next time that I drove it it stayed off...
I noticed this lights up when the hand brake is engaged, so it must be a
multi-purpose warning light, either that, or it is malfunctioning...  Is it
an overheating light...

3)  My rear hatch won't stay up - and it's bloody heavy to hold up with one
hand when trying to load/unload stuff from the back.  Are the two shocks on
the sides what lifts and holds up the rear hatch or is there also a spring
mechanism somewhere.

4) I'm going to be storing the car for about a year, before I ship it back
to Canada.  What do you steps do you recommend I take to store it safely?

Thanks very much,

Jake
