Here's a reminder to check/change your plugs soon...

I just pulled my old Bosch's and put in new Bosch platinums.  The old
plugs showed great coloration - light tannish - and no signs of oil or
other contamination.  Their age & mileage is unknown but I can say they
look great after my recent street and track use!  It's almost
imperceptable, but the car feels snappier on the new plugs.

If you've never changed your plugs before, don't be intimidated, the 928
is fairly easy in this respect.   Tool wise you can get by with the
factory toolset, else purchase a sparkplug socket and gap tool, u-joint,
extension and rachet. The 3/8ths drive variety is common in most home
garages. (Maybe some hand cleanser too).   For 32v cars, a spark plug
boot puller is very helpful and worth the couple of bucks to reduce the
risk of cracking a plug wire (many bucks!). Open the hood, protect the
fenders and get started (best with cold engine).  Remove the two ram air
tubes, and release/remove the airbox top cover, leaving the filter on so
nothing drops down the intake.  That's it!  All the plugwires should be
readily accessible.  Pull on the boot, never the wire!  Unscrew the old
plugs, they shouldn't be in there too tight.  When you install the new
plugs, check the gap first, then tighten them in by hand before using
the wrench to tighten the rest of the way.  Usually plugs get tightened
like an oil filter - cinch them in, then go 1/16 or so more (15 ft.


lbs).  Reattach the plug wires and airbox components (lining up any
rubber hoses fittings, etc.) and your done!  Fire it up and see if you
notice an improvement in response or gas mileage - I'm betting you do...



Speaking of which, a 'secret weapon' (eight of them) will be arriving
soon at Dad's workshop  - those famed TorqueMaster plugs!  Is anyone
else out there running them already?  (I hope you've all given up those
SplitFires).  I've heard encouraging data on the TorqueMasters and now
it's time to put 'em to the test.  I've also heard they love fuel and
will be playing with gas boosters and maybe that new HKS electronic
brain or simply adding rising rate regulators.

Fun! (really)
Phil
