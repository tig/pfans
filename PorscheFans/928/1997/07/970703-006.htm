>Jim,
>Just for your information (you may already know this), The seats in your
>928 are already RECARO. That is who makes the seats for Porsche to go into
>928s and I think, 911s and 944s. I didn't realize this until recently, when
>I was doing a seat swap in my 928, the original seats in my 89 and the
>seats from the 91GT both have RECARO stamped all over them underneath.
>But RECARO does of course, make different sizes, and this may make your
>swap easier.!!

For those who may not know: RECARO is an abbreviation for REutter
CAROsseriewerk. These were the folks who made custom bodies for Porsches in
the 50s, and who have made all of the seats for them since that time.
