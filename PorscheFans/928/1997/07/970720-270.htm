Pietro,
     The 928 Club Sport was basically a stripped-down GT. It was only 
available in Europe. It was only 
..3 of a second faster than a GT, or S4, I can't remember. This was completely 
dependent on the weight bias, some 300+ lbs of electronic stuff removed. If 
you are going to convert your car, forget it, it's not worth it! If you just 
wanted a Club Sport because no one else has one then you could buy one in 
Europe ($$$) and have it legally imported ($$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$). If you want to 
race and/or autocross you would be much better off finding a fire or theft 
victim S4 or GT, and strip every item of luxury out of it. You will be left 
with a windsheild, rear windows, a starter switch, and a tach. This will be 
much lighter than a Club Sport, and probably a lot less $$$. Of course you 
will need an aftermarket seat or two. If you want to drive it on the street, 
keep the lighting intact. 

Just my .02 worth.
