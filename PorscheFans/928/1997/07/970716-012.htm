Good Morning:  I have had a glorious week  driving my 928, Last weekend =
I took it to the Bay Area to pick up some parts at Parts Heaven, It sure =
is a nice road car, it was fun driving Hwy 50 out of the mountains, =
however Monday I took it to Carson City NV and on the way back I ran =
into some very heavy traffic, there was only one lane from the bottom of =
the hill all the way to Stateline.  Well it overheated , I let it cool =
down but when I started it up again I found the water pump leaking, is =
there a place near So Lake Tahoe CA that I can get a rebuilt one?  I =
would hate to have to drive all the way to the bay area again.=20
Thanks All
