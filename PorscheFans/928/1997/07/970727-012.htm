<< Whenever I floor my 928 and wind the engine into the high end of the tach,
 my Valentine One radar detector starts screaming.  This is really a pain
 since a cop is the last thing you need at that particular time.  Anyone
 else had this problem with this or any other radar detector?  I figure the
 engine electrics are emitting a bunch of noise at those high revs that
 stray into one of the bands the Val1 is monitoring.  Probably not much I
 can do about it (I love the Val1, otherwise).  I'd be interested if anyone
 else has had a similar problem.  If not, then maybe there is something
 unusual about my car that I can correct. >>

If there is interference, from the 928, get remote mounted radar and laser
derectors, I have them and have no problems what so ever.
