Stephane Cyr asked:

>> Would anybody tell me why you Pfans bought a 928 instead of a 911.  Performance, looks, dependability, quality???  Does anybody know about any good books on what I should be looking for when buying a 928?  (I.e. problems,  years to avoid if any, difference between model year) <<

All Porsches are great cars.  But there are differences.  928s have the
attribute that due to (lack of) popularity, they have depreciated much
faster than the air-cooled Porsches.  Thus, it is possible to purchase
one of the world's finest GT cars for very little money.  The other side
of that coin, is that the newest 928s make a lousy investment from a
financial standpoint.

An inexpensive start would be to purchase Issue #66, December 1996 or
Excellence magazine.  Back issues are available for $5.00 each (includes
P+H) from Excellence, P.O. Box 1529, Ross, CA 94957.  Bruce Anderson
does his usual fine job of describing the various models, years,
features, pitfalls, and market values of the 928s.  

Since you are considering 911s (other Porsches):

#69 - May 1997 - 1966-1973 911
#62 - June 1996 - 1974-1989 911
#63 - August 1996 - 911 Turbo & 912
#67 - February 1997 - Late-model 911s
