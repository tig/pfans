Sounds like the helper spring and the plastic keeper is binding.  While
you're under there, check the clutch pedal for cracks at the pivoting
area.  Step on the brake and put pressure on the clutch pedal.  If you
can feel some play on the clutch/brake cluster, then the mounting plate
is worn.  Another thing that you may want to check as part of the clutch
system; the coupler joint that sits on top of the torque tube.  It is
probably worn if you have excessive play on the shifter.  Shouldn't be
more that 1/4 inch of play.  You're in for alot of fun if you need to
replace this... :-)
