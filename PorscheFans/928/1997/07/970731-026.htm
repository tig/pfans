You are a man after my own heart. Putting the wood blocks under the wiper=
s is a new one to me. Will do. Though our P is rarely parked more than =
a day or two.

I am an engineer and now that you have said that, I think if I were desig=
ning a car I would make the wipers lift automatically when going to bed. =
Not lift way up, just enough to relieve the blades. Ever seen any that =
do so?

I am convinced dehumidification is helpful, though I don't know how the =
exact cost/benefit equation. Of course you are getting some dehumidificat=
ion with both your heating and your A/C. What evidence do you have that =
other than the drying effect, heating or A/C have a preservative effect?

They are already tinted. The hatchback is especially dark. Works good. =
Pays, too, in A/C savings. Yes, I think I will get my wife a sunguard. =
The shiny ones look like they would be better. You think?

>The sun is relentless on leather interiors.

Amen. See also my post today regarding comparison of redashing with leath=
er or vinyl. Especially the ideas re sunblocker.

 Want to go into business with me?


If it was going to be anyone, Brian, it would be you. But no, thanks.

Brian's Better Sun Blocker for Car Leather?

Brians Better Automatic Wiper Lifters?

Brians Better Half-automatic Wiper Lifters? You could make a little wire =
or plastic doodad that would stay on the wipers, then all you have to do =
is twist, like a switch, and lo, your wipers are relieved. Make it just =
so and it would automatically flip to the running position when the wiper=
s first moved. So you could manually twist it and leave them relieved whe=
never at rest, driving and parked.

For full automatic, you may just need a little ramp. The arm climbs the =
ramp just as it enters its bed. By bed I mean wherever it stops and rests=
..

On the rear of some vans, I have seen a little hook-like doodad that hold=
s the wiper in bed. Don't know if they do any relieving.
