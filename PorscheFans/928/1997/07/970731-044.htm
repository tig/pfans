I think Amsoil uses the term "Racing" to broaden rather than narrow the
application of this product. Amsoil Series 2000 is definitely intended to
be used in street vehicles under all conditions. To quote Amsoil:



RACING OIL 

Delivers unbeatable lubrication and protection in high performance gasoline
engines 

Engines in race cars, high-performance street cars, motorcycles, ATVs and
motorhomes face high temperatures, vigorous engine speeds or heavy loads,
each a potent stressor. AMSOIL Series 2000 20W-50 Synthetic Racing Oil
offers unmatched protection for engines facing tough operating conditions.


Application 

AMSOIL Series 2000 20W-50 Synthetic Racing Oil performs at a level
surpassing the requirements of the following specifications and may be used
in any engine requiring an oil that meets these specifications: 



	API SH, CD 
	Ford ESR-M2C 179A 
	CCMC G-4 and PD-2 
	VW 500.00, 501.01, 505.00
	Ford ESE M2C153E 
	Proposed GF-2 


Mixing AMSOIL 

AMSOIL Series 2000 20W-50 Synthetic Racing Oil may be mixed with
petroleum-based oils or with other synthetic oils. However, a mixture of
AMSOIL Series 2000 20W-50 Synthetic Racing Oil and another oil may offer a
shorter service life than pure AMSOIL Series 2000 20W-50 Synthetic Racing
Oil does. The AMSOlL Product Warranty does not apply to mixtures of AMSOIL
Series 2000 20W-50 Synthetic Racing Oil and other oils. 


New Vehicles Under Warranty 

AMSOIL Series 2000 20W-50 Synthetic Racing Oil may be used in the engine of
any vehicle, including those under warranty, for which the vehicle
manufacturer requires use of an SAE 20W-50, API SH, CD oil. Use of AMSOIL
Series 2000 20W-50 Synthetic Racing Oil will not void new vehicle warranties.
