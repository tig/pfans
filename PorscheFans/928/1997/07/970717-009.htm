If I understand right, you have a stuck bolt?

First try a penetrating oil, such as Liquid Wrench. WD40 is often
used, but not as effective.

For a really stuck bolt, heat can work well. The purpose of the heat
is to break any corrosion bond in the threads. Too much is NOT better
than not enough, as the heat can damage other items nearby. Warm the
bolt with the torch, try the wrench on it, warm some more, try
again...
