Steve,

	I am a die hard Porsche 928 fan, and I am only 23 years old.  I am
still trying to find one (5-speed S4/GT) in great shape.  I have driven a lot of
porsches mainly 928s since I was 16. Those are great cars that are very reliable
and perform great.  But at your age, I do not advise you to buy such a car.
It is nothing personal, but from my personal experience, when I was your age,
I was very reckless, and did not really value and judge things like I do now.
Moreover, and from your mail you asked if you could take a 928 to a "general
repair shop on porsche".  I don't think so, the 928 is a highly technical car,
and needs real professional care.  If there is a way to really mess it up is
to take it to that kind of garages. If you decide to buy a 928, which is one
of the best cars ever built, you should prepare yourself to spend money on it
to keep it in shape (mainly preventative maintenance).
	My advise is to wait until you are over 21. Then you would start to
appreciate the art and value of things, then buy yourself a decent 928.
Meanwhile, get a "sporty car" that would be easy and cheap to drive daily,
maybe a Honda Prelude VTEC...

Khaled
