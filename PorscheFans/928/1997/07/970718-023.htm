Mathew,
The valve you are refering to is likely the same as the one on my 78. It
is made by VDO and is half blue, half black. If memory serves, the black
side goes toward the engine. In fact it's marked as such if you look
closely near the base of the one nipple.

You should be able to easily suck air from the engine side, but not at
all from the opposite side. When I say easily, I don't mean completely
effortlessly, but without gagging on your eyeballs...

I found that with mine I could suck air with some difficulty in either
direction. My climate controls and cruise control work great after I
replaced the valve.
