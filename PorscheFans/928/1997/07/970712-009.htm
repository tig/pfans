After a full 7 weeks of being in  the shop, I picked up my car on Thursday.
I enjoyed the 24 hours I had with it, but disaster has once again struck my
beloved 928.

I parked my car in Boston as I went into a stereo shop to find some
crossovers for my speakers, and came out 45 minutes later to see a crowd of
people sorrounding my car. As I got closer, I saw the whole driver's side
smashed in. It looked like an 18- wheeler side swiped it ! I frantically
pleaded people to remember if they saw anything, but as soon as the cops
showed up, they all split. It happened on Columbia Rd. in Dorchester, which
if you're from Boston you'd know that it is one of the rougher
neighborhoods, whose residents don't become witnesses readily (especially
for a white guy like me in a Porsche driving in from the suburbs). I made a
police report, but there is no description of the car that did it, no
plate, nothing. Just a lot of bumper black and gray paint on my Porsche.

The front fender is gone, it has cuts and holes in it, and it is aluminum,
so it can't be repaired. The door has a similar slash, so it's gone too.
The rear quarter panel has damage, but its galvanized steel and can
hopefully be saved. My side skirt is gone, and both of my rims are
seriously scratched/scuffed. Also, both driver's tires need help (losing
air).

The fender lists for about $1,500, the door for a whopping $3,500, and the
rims for $900 (good thing I had my stock Rims on it as my technology wheels
are out for chroming).

I figure a minimum if $5,000 damage, and a max of $10,000.

Any thoughts from people with 928s and dealings with insurance companies
(regarding totalling the car, etc.)?
