 Subject:	K & N Filter Alert!!
 Importance:	High
 
 928 Fans,
 After reading some of the "posts" on our site concerning the K&N air 
 filters allowing fine particles into our engines, I was a little surprised 
 and nervous.
 
 I decided to e-mail K&N directly about this matter, and included the 
 "technical data" from all of the "posts" on this site. I expressed to them 
 in a courteous and professional manner my concerns and also that I have 
 used their products for many years in all of my vehicles.
 
 It has been  over  a  week since my e-mail , and I have recieved no 
 response from them. This causes me even more concern about the K&N filters. 
 
 If the information I sent them was incorrect or they had other data to 
 contradict the problem of the K&N filters allowing fine dust particles into 
 our engines, surely they would have responded promptly (I also expressed 
 the fact that over 700 members were concerned about this matter).
 
 Due to this Silence, I am going back to the paper elements and risk losing 
 performance (I honestly could never tell the difference , anyway) but 
 gaining a longer lasting engine.
 
 I highly recommend you consider the same.

========================================
Dear Sir

   Before you jump to a conclusion about K&N you must understand that it
takes some period of time to answer a letter of the sort that you sent to me.
The letter that asks so many questions takes a long time to answer. Your
questions needed specific answers. You should have recieved my letter by now.
I recieve about 250 to 400 emails per week that I must answer in addition to
my other duties. It would be of no value whatsoever for myself nor K&N to
ignore your letter.

                         John, K&N technical advisor
 ***



































                                                                          ***
And to all those reading this letter I extend my greetings and ask that you
look at the proud history of K&N Engineering and understand that K&N has
always made a quality product and will continue to do so in the future.
