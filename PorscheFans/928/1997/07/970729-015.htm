<<The seller of one of the cars I am interested in  tells me that he had to
replace the timing belt after the "light when on">>

This statement that you made scares me a little.  I would religiously check
all the records for this car, and ask a LOT of questions about upkeep, etc.
 The PO (previous owner) should NOT have changed the timing belt only after
the light came on... he/she should have changed it as time and mileage
dictated.  Red flag to improper service in my book.  If the car runs fine
then there was no damage done, but make him take the car in for an inspection
to a shop of your choosing.  Tell him "If you stand behind the car as you say
you do then you pay for the inspection.  If everything is OK I'll reimburse
you and buy the car."  If he has treated the car right he won't hesitate.  I
wouldn't b/c I KNOW that there is nothing that my car needs.  If he treated
the car like sh*# then he won't go for it, and you should politely walk away.
 Too many other 928's out there for sale.  Where exactly is 5 miles from the
end of the planet anyway?  I might be able to help you find a 928.  I live in
S. Indiana and own a business doing auto locating, brokering, detailing and
performance upgrades.  I specialize in Porsche and Mercedes-Benz.  Let us
know how your search for you 928 goes.
