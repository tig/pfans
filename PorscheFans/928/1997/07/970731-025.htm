Sorry I couldn't find the original post to do a quote & reply to.  I'm on a
different computer at this time.

A question arose from a post that I made earlier about the legality of
photographing or videotaping into a house/hotel or private area.

In talking to a Captain of a local cop shop who also has his own P.I.
business.  He said that IN MICHIGAN (but not all states), that it IS LEGAL
to tape or photograph into a private area.  Providing that you meet a few
requirements.

First, the equipment that you are using has to be readily available to the
general public.  Not specialized military, counterintelligence or spy stuff.

Next, the photo/videographer must be shooting from a public place.  I don't
know if that includes a hotel room from across the street or whatever, but
this is not the point in question anyways.

Last, the window or doors must have been left open by the people in the
house and be visible to the general public.  I.e. you can't come up close
to the house and peep in through just a small sliver in the window blinds
or shades.

Hope this answers the question.
