	Roy,
     Does your switch stick when you push it down? The window and sunroof 
motors are the same (I think) and there is a small set of spoon-shaped 
'points', (like in a distributor) on the inside of the housing. If the motor 
or wires get too hot, the points 'oil-can', to open the circuit and stop the 
flow of electricity. These points often get corrosion or dirt on them or they 
can fatigue, thus, not conducting very well if at all. Not much you can do 
about this if this is the problem. In my window motors, I had to file them and 
bend them to stay together, basically disabling them. After that, I had to 
bypass one of them, because I got tired of messing with it. My window switches 
were sticking, because my console was sun swollen. I cut the area around the 
switches, and have never had a problem since. My sunroof stopped about six 
months ago, and I thought it was the same problem, but when I took the cover 
off and turned the motor by hand, it started to work again. I think it had a 
'flat-spot' in it, or the lack of winter time use, made it build up enough 
corrosion that it wouldn't make the initial contact. Since then, I open the 
sunroof every week or so and I have had no problems.
