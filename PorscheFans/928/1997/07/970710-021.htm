Hello all,
Just received & opened the July Panorama.  There is a very good article on
how to purchase a 928 filled with great charts, graphs, pics, and
comparisons.  I was really impressed.  Isn't it a new law that everyone HAS
to own a 928?  Or is it just the people that can appreciate them HAVE to own
them?  I think we (as 928 owners) should lobby for a new law enabling every
car enthusiast with good taste to be given the provisions to own one.  That
way we could get all the poor abused 928's out of the junkyards and the hands
of owners who don't keep them serviced.  Yeah, that's the ticket.
