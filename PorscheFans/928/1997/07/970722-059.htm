Will Gaines,

It wasn't _my_ alternator that burned internally. That was a problem experienced
by another 928 owner. (I remember reading that, too, but couldn't find the
reference with a quick search) No big deal.

As far as the condition of my engine cavity; the car is a 79 yet it only has
50000 miles on it. The car did sit for 6 years, outside, under a tree in a
backyard in Austin, TX. The orange wiring harness jacket was in good condition
in the area where the internal rubber rot was prevalent.

If you want to be more confident of the integrity of you wiring, try an ohm-
meter test. Check for continuity between wires which shouldn't have any
connection while moving and squeezing the outer jacket. For example, positive
connections to the starter (1 big wire) and the solenoid (2 smaller wires)
shouldn't be shorting together. Just disconnect the battery before proceeding!

Good luck,
