I agree with the comment about the oil brand choice with one exception:
The local penzoil distributor recommended AGAINST using the regular
penzoil oil in Porsche.  He said he would only use their racing
grade (red bottle?) if he owned the car.  That was kind of
surprising to me.

My  mechanics swears by the Royal Purple stuff.  Never tried it because
it is very expensive.  They say Mobil 1 is very good (and it is the 
stuff they now recommend).

As for your oil grade, The 928 engine should be using some 20 W50 oil.
You might want to give it a try, except in cold month, especially
since you describe smoother running with the thickest grade.

Just my $0.02.
