Derron - I bought the fiche for $30 and a used reader for $20, a few
years ago. The manual assumes that you have auto repair skills, but
not that you have specialized training. And it does have a lot of
useful information. For me, the problems with the fiche are that the
wiring diagrams are illegible, the pictures are often impossible
to make sense of, and the fiche set (17 of them) is awkward to work
with. The manual does have pictures of many of the special tools,
by the way, though it appears to me that competent mechanics often
get by without them.
