  Did you forego using the flush because you didn't think it was
  necessary, or were you afraid of gasket damage, etc.?  (BTW, the
  flush smelled a lot like gasoline to me when I put it in my Ford...)
  Also, do you know if the bugaboos you mentioned are caused because of 
  mixing the synthetic with whatever residual dino oil remains in the 
  crankcase?
  
  Since the PFans archive server seems to be down, I can't look up
  the URL that you sent out a couple of weeks ago which talked about
  Amsoil's oil testing.  Could you send that to me?  I'm curious about
  how the performance of the Series 2000 20W50 oil differs from Amsoil's
  plain-jane synthetic of the same weight.
