Hi Kevin:

The only amps that are going to fit will be those $19.95 sub-entry level
'amps' that you see on sale in Grand Auto...  Please don't go that
route, you will be unhappy with the sonic performance!   If you must
stick with the stock location, the only real alternative I see is taking
a good amp apart and remounting it piece by piece somehow.  This will no
doubt void all warranties, cost a bundle, but might get your car into a
sound magazine...

Others have usually removed the spare, etc. and made an amp rack in
there.  I put a 4.6x Rockford on the passenger side tray - it fit
perfect, red fin color compliments the car and also re-routed the glove
box AC hose to cool the amp instead.  There was room leftover to mount
the RF crossover and secondary fuse, which I illuminated with a red LED
(triggered by remote turn-on lead).  The GT has no trays because of the
airbags, so I'm thinking about another custom location.

A bigger project is building a raised floor (or portion of) in the trunk
area or utilizing the rear seat backs.  Or even a rotating amp/sub
rack.  It's up to you how far you want to take it.  FWIW, I saw a 911 at
Parts Heaven's concours and the owner completely enclosed the rear
passenger area for six subs.  Needless to say it was utterly tasteless
IMHO, too much dead weight for an already rear-heavy car but to each his
own.  (I'll let others comment on the paint job and wheels if they want
to have fun ripping on it too)

One area that hasn't been discussed before is using the door pockets,
though the amps had better be tough to put up with the extra pounding of
opening/closing.  I suppose one could use the trunk 'walls/ledges' also
with some success.  If you go off the deep end, there's plenty of room
behind the front fenders for amps/batteries/rotary subs/what have you.

Well, that's plenty of fodder.  You need to discuss your plans with an
installation shop for advice on wiring, speakers, etc. when you're
ready.

Go for it but try not to hack the car up too much!
Phil
