No, it's money retentive. The professionals who prepare top-level concours
cars spend a lot of time on each car and charge accordingly; it's a
lucrative business. At the highest levels, customer outlays are comparable
to those for major racehorses, and are made for the same reasons.

Also with respect to money, real RS and RSR cars are much prized and very
rare, and so command huge prices compared to other 911 variants of
comparable age, or to cars functionally identical or superior which were
built after the fact by owners rather than being born that way. If I wanted
a lean, quick, nimble 911, I'd go directly to a well-built RS (for the
street) or RSR (for the track) replica and use the unspent $50-100 k to buy
lunch (or a racehorse).

Even this is not anal retentive in context. If two otherwise perfect and
immaculate cars appear in a concours, the judges need some basis on which
to pick one, and aligned screws have done this trick more than once.

Bonne chance!
