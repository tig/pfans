May I humbly suggest the concept that Frank is not really at fault?
He only posted one message and the NTList software which is serving
the Porschefans lists is endlessly replicating the message.

This is a well known flaw in NTList. Its not the first time its done
it to us poor subscribers. The best way to join the problem is to
reply to the cloned message. The best way to duplicate the problem
is to send one message to a lot of lists. Used to be, 5 lists was all
it took to activate the bug.

My email software maintains a database of message ID's and automatically
drops the duplicates so I don't see the bulk unless I go direct to the
Unix command line mail. Was curious the other day when 318 messages
were queued and downloaded but only 51 showed up.
