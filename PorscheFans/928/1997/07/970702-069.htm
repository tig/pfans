	Yes, I was aware, although it was only in the BACK of my mind. I meant I was 
thinking of an aftermarket seat; sportier, non-powered, more lateral support 
and a slighly firmer feel. Thanks for recharging my diminishing short-term 
memory. By the way, take some pix of your car the next time it sees daylight, 
and send them to Phil. We would love to see more 'readers rides'!
