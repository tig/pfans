David,
As far as the Factory radio goes, my ex-81 and ex-84 both had Factory 
installed radios. If your radio has "spiced and taped" wires it was 
installed by an amateur, not Porsche.

If you want to find out for sure about yours you can send off to PCNA and 
have them run your Vin# and they will send you back a suitable for framing 
certificate that lists all options that were factory installed on your car, 
and yes the engine, and transmission serial numbers.(so you can wave it in 
the Corvette Guys faces, if you like)

A "temporary fix" is one thing, put you did not make that clear in your 
original "post"

Also just because the wires are Bosch and even if they have the BERU 
connectors this doesn't make them factory replacement wires, see below.

The Spark Plug wire thing is a personal peeve, directed more at the 
so-called "OEM" suppliers. These guys sell you wires that they say are 
factory but are not. I have gone through and returned over 6 sets of 
aftermarket wires in the last 8 years on 928s.

 All I have been trying to do is to pass on my experience that NOTHING FITS 
and WORKS BETTER than the factory wires.
The most prominent feature that is always missing from every "OEM" type, 
and "aftermarket" type spark plug wires is the extra heat insulators that 
are strategically placed (by PORSCHE ONLY) on the wires where Porsche has 
determined through their extensive design and testing is the "hot spots" on 
the engine. These extra "Sleeves" of insulation help protect the wires from 
the extensive radiant heat form the aluminum engine in strategic 
locations... I do not think that K-Mart Wires and other "Custom Fit" wires 
have done any amount of testing for use on your 928 engine or any aluminum 
engine as far as that goes.

Please also keep in mind that the factory replacement wires you buy today 
at Porsche make use of the latest design and best materials made to date 
for your 928. Porsche has always continuously updated and improved all 
aspects of their cars and maintenance products and will continue to do so.

PORSCHE, THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE.
