LOL!   That Gixer needed to be down at least two gears from 70 - maybe
he blew the changes?  Oh wait a minute, you guys only went to 70???


....One of my favorite memories from younger, crazier days:

I owned a nice, new black Kawi ZX-6 and enjoyed taking the beast out way
late at night for some freeway running, since the roads are fairly
deserted at that time.  I won't reveal the location but suffice to say
I'm sure the military had a hand in designing it for hi-speed
transportation of trucks and equipment - it's no two lane country road!

So, I was going along at a pretty good clip (85 or so in top gear) in
the fast lane (natch) when I pulled up to a black NSX of all things
(back when they were new and fairly rare).  Well, he sped up a bit and
we were running neck and neck down the road, at what speed I'm not sure
but we weren't racing yet.  I could see directly into his car since his
dashlights were up full and that's when I saw him downshift...

Instantaneously I clutched it and banged down a gear - TWIST SMOOTHLY
FULL ON & TUCK IN - the race was on!!!!  errrrrrRRRRRRRRRR  14k rpm's
bang off the shift to top gear...  hey I'm dropping that NSX like a
toy!?!  He's at least five car lengths back - my best guess while
sneaking a quick peak in the mirror.   I've got my helmet fully tucked
behind the fairing, elbows and knees in, slightly raised off the saddle
to help with airflow - throttle absolutely pegged - glance at the speedo
- OH SH#T  it's pegged at 150mph and we're going around turns too albeit
nice long ones (big tip this is a interstate huh)!   NSX still back
there too.   We stayed in that pattern for about 30 seconds or so and
came up on traffic - a single car up ahead in lane #2.  We pulled up on
him so damn fast, the car panic'd and the sumb#tch pulled over into the
fast lane!  I hit the brakes best I could and scared the *wits* out of
myself, pushed into the center to get around him, nailed it to pass and
pushed it back in the fast lane.  Whew!   I started rolling off the
throttle since the Acura slowed way down too.

But no, that wasn't enough for him!   Again he pulled alongside.  My
heart was still pounding but almost skipped a beat when I looked over
and saw he was laughing - then I saw him downshift again!  The red mist
never really cleared from my brain and before I knew it I was down a
gear, tucked in and going full bore again!   The ZX dropped him again.
Only now I started to relax - engine winding great,  unbelievable helmet
roar, scan the instruments, check R side  mirror - hey what's this -
he's further back this time and has his lights off!   Jesus christ,
we're running down the road at 150+  and  he's driving off my
headlights!!!

The lunacy of all this finally sets in my head so I checked the mirrors
again and eased over into the slow lane, then rolled off the throttle.
He catches up quickly and then is gone as I brake down back to 80 or
so.  It feels like I'm not even moving or in slow motion.   I thank my
lucky stars that I didn't go down and erase myself all over the road.  I
recall some horror stories of finding headless riders at accident scenes
and start to question my sanity about doing all those runs without
leathers and boots, not that they'd help much at hyper speeds but
definately better than jeans and hiking boots.

A short time later, five motorcyclists were killed doing the Sunday
morning banzai run to Stinson Beach - a car had crossed the center
divider from the opposite direction and they slammed into it one after
another.  Horrible.  That's when I started to lose my nerve about
bikes.  I've ridden since my early 20's, been down hard a few times, and
knew my time was running out.  Anyways,  I continued to ride that
Kawasaki,  the best bike I've ever owned, for just awhile longer but
have now long since hung up my Arai helmet...  (well maybe I should
start worrying again now that I've replaced it with a Shoei and the
GT!?!)

Jim - I'll leave you to tell the tale of the Mad Hatter's ride to
Alice's - wild car or bike runs which still go on to this day/night.   I
*know* you have the experience with that VFR in the garage and Hwy 92
right up the road - plus I'll bet you've cooled way down too.  Are we
getting wiser or just older?  As long as we're still getting it I guess,
since the alternative means  your ____.

Be careful out there,
Phil-counting lucky stars some more
ps.
just knocked on wood for good measure.
pps.
I need a cigarette!
ppps.
Now you all know why I smoke incessantly!
