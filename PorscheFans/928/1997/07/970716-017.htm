|I think that the PO had put in a product to stop leaks in the coolent system,
|Bars Leaks if I remember correctly, but could the crud be left over in the
|tank from the treatment. I am going to find Bars Leaks and see what it is and
|looks like and compare to make sure, but I am going to flush the system to be
|safe though.  Thanks for the help.

Oh yes, bars Leaks is brown, that would be it!

It is not a "treatment" as such though. It is mixed in with the coolant
solution. When some part of the sytem starts to leak the Bars hardens as it is
released from the system, thus blocking the leak. I have used it before (in my
younger days whilst aquiring some wisdom ;-)) it will get you buy if you use it
on a <replace with cheap daily ride> for a short time. If your cooling system
works efficiently though the pressure will maintain a minor leak forever.

I would NOT use it on any car that deserves some respect. Flush the system, I
would use a minimal amount of antifreeze as I suspect the problem (i.e. leak)
will become apparent soon enough. Who knows maybe the "leak" was from the water
pump (some hope of blocking that!).

Anyway find the leak and fix it/get it fixed.
