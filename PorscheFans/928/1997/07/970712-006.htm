(Well, I am out for a cruise and we start smelling this crisp smell.
No its not 4th of july bbq, its brake pad smoke...

I thought the problem was solved, the brakes worked well even Friday, 
but today, almost total lock up...  To keep highway speed (not an area
I wanted to stop in) I had to drop down in 4th gear.  I then stoped 
for 10 minutes to let the thing cool down and the brakes appeared to 
have released again.  Why??...) SNIP!

Stephane,
I have posted several times now my similar experience and the costly fix
that solved the problem.  In the case of my 1986 928S, I had to replace
the brake vacuum booster unit (ca. $400).  It appears that they can fail
in such a manner as to cause them to pull on the brake master cylinder
and engage the brakes while you are driving, without any foot pressure
being applied on the brake pedal.  This may not be your problem, but
since you have already reported to us that you completely rebuilt the
brake calipers, etc., I would give strong consideration to this as the
source of your problem.  Good luck!
