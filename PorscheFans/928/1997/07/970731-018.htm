Hmm...something odd here; it's coming from the back of the motor, at
no load, but it's affected by the gear you're in (at the other end
of the car)? First thing to do is to get the car on a lift and
see if you can reproduce the noise where it's easy to hear and
localize. Doesn't sound much like a torque tube, though.

Go ahead and ask your questions in public, don't be shy. We all
might learn something, right?
