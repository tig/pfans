David,
My "post" was PURELY IN FUN, no snips, no rips, no muss, no fuss etc.
I just found it humorous that someone would go to all that trouble to save 
a little money on such a Classic Performance Automobile.
I apologize to John and any other 928 Fans if it was in "poor taste". I 
have always assumed we were all adults and could take a little humor now 
and then. John and I have been communicating with each other about 928 
"stuff" for a while now and I think(and hope) he knows my comment was 
"lighthearted" and not mean or uncivilized. Just a little FOURTH OF JULY 
HUMOR.
P.S. When you get the rest of your "homemade" wires finished let us know 
about the long term results , say in about 15 years or so, which seems to 
be the life of the $175 Porsche Spark Plug Wires.
P.S.S. What would you do if you were looking at a 928 to buy and pay top 
dollar for and opened the hood and saw Cheap Aftermarket Wires, etc. on it? 
It would make me think the Owner did not maintain the car to the proper 
factory standards, and took short-cuts wherever possible in its maintenance 
and upkeep.
I would walk away.
