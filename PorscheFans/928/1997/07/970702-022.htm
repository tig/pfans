Leonard Laub <leonard@visionthree.com> responded to Andy's:
>I thought it would be obsurd...

Subject: Re: Sorry (this is for Andy only)
You may be obsurd, but you're odorable, too.

>I'm a computer scientist

Then couldn't you have worked Andy's e-mail address out of his message
header and replied privately to him?

>You're forgiven, I'm grumpy

Just as long as you're not dopey!

Geez, guys, you've already taken all of the good dwarves.  From the limited
pickings, I guess I'd have to be sneezy! *

* Story: A friend just started working for the NY Philharmonic, whose music
director is Kurt Mazur... formerly director of the famed Leipzig Gewandhaus
orchestra.  In her first week on the job someone in the open-plan office
sneezed.  Instead of the usual "gesundtheit!" she blurted out "gewandhaus!"
Everyone at work convulsed laughing.
