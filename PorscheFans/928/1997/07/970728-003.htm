Brian,

Is a battery tender different from a battery charger?  I'm buying the
Porsche battery that David Roberts is parting out so I'll probably get a
battery tender to keep it up if I can figure out what one is.

I know I'm not doing my battery any favors by letting it discharge, but
it's lasted longer (5+ yrs) than most batteries I've owned.  Most of the
time, though, I don't know that I won't be driving the car for three weeks
- it just happens - usually due to weather conditions, but other things
occasionally keep me out of my Porsche as well.  I always think I'll take
it out in a day or two and it turns into weeks.  Do you go to all the
trouble of pulling up your floor mats and unscrewing the fuse panel cover
frequently to hook up a battery tender?  The only way I'd do that is if I
KNEW I wasn't going to drive it for a while and that's rarely the case.
