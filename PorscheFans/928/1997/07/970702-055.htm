Just a note to thank all who responded concerning the Devek catalog timing
question that I had posted previously. Especially Leonard and Stephane
(thanks for your expertise) What I really didn't understand was the fact that
Devek made it sound like it was just a matter of re-marking the harmonic
balancer for the 15 degree mark and timing it. I really prefer Leonards'
recommendations over messing with the cam gears, now the trick is to find
someone local (preferably) with the know how to do it.
Leonard-- who did yours? 

Took out K&N filter to clean and lube today -- am somewhat concerned over
previous postings regarding relative ineffectiveness in filtering the small
stuff. Compared by looking at sun thru original paper filter and then K&N.
Pretty amazing that the paper filter just blurs the light completely while
the K&N has zillions of small holes all in it, and you can see thru it quite
easily. I guess this is why they provide so much more airflow! Cleaned
thoroughly and oiled heavily (Something"s got to catch the small stuff)
Clearly, the K&N filter has to have the oil to make it effective! 

Ordered Blue Ionized Bulbs and Wiring Kit today from Competition Limited
1-800-770-5553. Cost was 78$ plus S+H. Wiring kit will give bulbs more oomph
and protect from overloading current wiring. Said to be a plug in (no
soldering or splicing) kit. 
They also said that the Stargate Superion bulbs are not lasting and these are
supposed to be a better bulb.
Still, these are only replicate the Xenon systems which are like 900$ to
install.
Will post my satisfaction or lack thereof.
