  Sounds like you had a good time!  At my first autocross, I was racing
my '84 Supra in G-Stock class against an assortment of other cars.  I
realized how much I had to learn when I was beaten by an '86 Mustang with
a V-6 and white-wall tires!  How embarrassing...

  Keep at it.  Next time, see if an experienced auto-Xer will let you walk
the course with them before the event.  After a while, you'll be able to 
read the course like an experienced golfer would read the green.  This will
make all the difference in getting rid of the "sea of cones" effect.

  Looking forward to hearing about the next adventure.
