Subject:	928 Mechanics in Sacramento?

Hi
This is my first contact with such a large group of landshark owners.
I have had my 928 for about a year and am still trying to work all the
bugs out.  Does anybody know of a real good 928 mechanic in the
Sacramento area?  I have been using German Specialty Car in Rosville,
they seem to be ok but I don't know if they are real experts or not.  I
know there are at least a couple of other us in Sacramento (I've seen
the cars around town)=20

I can't wait for the 928 day at Devek Performance, should be fun!
