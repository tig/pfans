I have seen two models of the 928. One of which I bought at a nearby hobby
shop. It was a Japanese company, as nearly all the writing on the bax was in
Japanese. The other, which I did not get was a "Revel" model. It was a pre-S
type which was why I chose not to buy it. Also, I have seen these models and
other 928 items at memorobelia and book sales occasionally run by PCA
regions. My prize model is a 1:43 scale of my "S" in my color. All the lids
and doors operate as well. Moreover it came with it's own display box. I
found it at one of our (PCA Potomac) "Vendor night" events several years
ago. Occasionally, I see this sort of stuff at our yearly "Swap Meet". Check
out the "Schedule" page of "pcapotomac.org".

Good luck. Ed
