> Are 928 more dependable than 911?

Depends.  The 928 engine has a design life of 250-300,000 miles. I
personally know of one with 250,000+ which still runs very well. 
However, a 928 exposed to weather and not maintained could become your
worst nightmare.  928s are very complex cars (particularly later cars)
and can have perplexing (i.e costly) electrical and FI problems.  A car
from a snowy climate could have moisture and corrosion in the main
fuse/relay panel, which is under the passenger feet.  As with any
Porsche, you should buy the best and most recent car you can find for
the money. (easier said than done).

> Did they make any 928 with galvanized steel doors, fenders?

All 928 fenders, doors and hood are aluminum.  Remainder of the body is
hot-dipped galvanized.  In fact, Porsche invented a special process for
welding galvanized steel which is licensed to other makers.

> Are prices for parts higher or lower than for 911?

New parts from the dealer may be higher.  The 1995 928s retailed for
$85,000+.  These were expensive cars.  OTOH, due to severe depreciation
coupled with high new parts costs, insurance companies will total any
928 involved in anything more than a trivial crash.  Thus, good
condition major mechanical and body parts (and sometimes interior parts
too) are often readily available used, at pretty good prices.

> 928S4 1987-88 would go for? (a jewel)

$20,300 (1987) to 22,525 (1988)  Both for cars in excellent condition.
These prices may be a little high.  I am aware of cars sold/offered for
a lot less.  Deduct a LOT for any defect.  (1987-poor $13,195).  5-spd
cars would be at the high end due to rarety.
