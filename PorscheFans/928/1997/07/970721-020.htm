Hello Gentlemen,
On the way into work today, driving along 128 North in lovely
Massachusetts, I was first stalked , then pulled over by Mr. Happy State
Police Officer.  I was not speeding.  He pulled me over in the midst of
bumper to bumper traffic on this little dirt swale area, which by the
way was incredibly potholed to the point where I banged the s^&t out of
my front airdam and plate underneath.  He comes over and says, you have
no front liscence plate.  Duh!  I told him it fell off.  No problem
really, I think, I'll just put it back on...Then he says to roll up the
window half way.  He pulls out this gadget and puts it on the window. 
"Hey, your windows are too dark."  What!?!?  My windows are only as dark
as the lords of Porsche (or, could be the idiots of the dealership) made
them.  This apparently is no good in this, the capital of taxes and iron
gripped law enforcement.  Then he asked me if I was carrying any
"contraband" in the car.  "Uh yeah, sure officer..."  Jeez.  Just
because my windows are dark he thinks I'm a drug dealer.  A pimp too.  I
tried to show him the factory sticker that says something like "extra
dark drug dealer or pimp tint" but he didn't care.  The worst thing was
that he didn't tell me what I needed to do about it (aside from riping
it off I guess.)  I did get off with a warning though.  
I found out that you can have a maximum of 35% (mine are 32%)
transmittance on the side windows. I dunno what it is for the rears, but
I have been told that it can be completely black (which mine is...)
So all you honest, generally law abiding citizens out there, make sure
your windows aren't too dark, else you raise the ire of the law.
