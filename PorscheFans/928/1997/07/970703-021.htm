Any time he likes, but the basis for resolving this question is whether
there's something better to do with the car's current resale value (if and
when obtained; right, Phil?) and the expected cost of maintenance and repairs.

If all of the following are true:

1. you like your car
2. anything as good or better for you costs significantly more (taking cost
of maintenance of both options into account)
3. competent mechanic capability (in whatever combination of your and a
shop's) is in fact available

then you should keep the car as long as this remains true, no matter what
the resale value might become.

For example, I have a 1976 Mercedes-Benz 450 SEL (I know, this isn't a 928,
but I'm bringing this up for a 928 purpose). This is the big V8 sedan from
that era. I bought it with 50k miles in 1979 for $18,000. The car now has
over 200,000 miles, and high blue book on it is about $1200.

However, it's as powerful, solid,  gorgeous, and satisfying to drive as
when new, because (a) it's built extremely well (better, frankly, than
anything Mercedes builds today) and (b) I've maintained it (including
replacing such components as have broken, which list doesn't include the
engine, which will probably run forever on a diet of premium gas, frequent
oil changes, and full throttle).

A comparable new or late model car (e.g., the S420, which compensates for
its mechanical refinement by its utterly undistinguished looks) would cost
a lot more than $50k, so I'm comfortable continuing to maintain this
particular car indefinitely.

Compared to that example, my S4 is much earlier in what I expect to be the
same life cycle. Because of its robust construction and maintainability, I
honestly don't foresee a point where I'll give it up for economic reasons.
As long as I enjoy it and don't find it clearly lacking compared to newly
available alternatives, I'll keep it and keep it up.

The flaw in your otherwise sound plan is that you will no longer have a
competent, comfortable high performance street car, and you'll have to pay
something to get one. Economic calculations should take all costs and
values into account.

Ah, but there is! You wash the car when it becomes dirty; you detail it
periodically and make sure there's always a good coat of wax on it, you
buff it out or compound it when it develops swirl marks, and you repaint it
when the paint finally dies. If you wrinkle a fender, you have a competent
body shop repair and repaint. If you break a wheel hitting a pothole, you
replace the wheel.

It all comes down to maintenance. If you like the car and you derive value
from the experience of being in it, you pay for that value by the decrease
in resale value as the miles run up and the maintenance and repairs which
come up with use. This is not the philosophy of a concours competitor or
serious collector, but that of someone who wants to enjoy driving, the more
the better, and is willing to pay for that enjoyment.

If you want purchase price to be your only expense, buy something new and
get rid of it before the warranty lapses. I find this expensive (high
acquisition price and lots of depreciation) and unsatisfactory (I become
attached to the cars I like and don't want to lose them).
