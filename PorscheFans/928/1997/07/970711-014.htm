Hello all

I wrote in a few weeks ago about the problem I was having with the odometer
quitting in my car. I sent the gauge cluster off to be repaired and waited.
I received the gauges back and installed them only to find that the speedo
went to 110mph when to key was turned on. The gauges went back again. I
installed them again and found that the tach had quit working but the
speedo was fine. I really didn't want to send them back again and have
nothing work when they came back.
I called 928 International and told them of my troubles and asked how much
a tach was. They suggested that I replace the wiring harness that attaches
to the back of the gauge cluster. Being that my car is a '78 they thought
that some of the copper runs, in the plastic mat that there incased in,
might have broken and might not be making a complete circuit. I did this
yesterday ( took about an hour total ) and everything works fine. I found
what I had paid $135.00 for on the old wiring harness.
All they did was solider three places on the back of the connection to the
speedo. I'm sure that the problem with the speedo going to 110mph was a bit
of solider that ran between two of the solider joints making a circuit. 
I would have thought that a VDO repair shop would have done a little better
job than this. When I sent the gauges in the first time I included a letter
that told them to check it over and replace anything that looked suspect
just so long as they let me know ahead of time. 

Be careful if you send your guages to North Hollywood Speedometer
