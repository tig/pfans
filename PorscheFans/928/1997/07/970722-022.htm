     Subject: Fuel Injection
     
     One of the rubber hoses leading from the fuel rail to a fuel injector 
     on my
     1981 928 has begun to leak.  The dealer tells me that to replace the 
     hose I
     must replace the entire injector also.  This can get a little costly.  
     Can
     the hose be replaced by itself?  If so, how?

     Holley:
     
     I had the same problem with my '82.  Your mechanic is correct, the 
     hose is permanently attached to the injector.  It would be a real pain 
     in the butt to separate it and replace it only to have it start 
     leaking again.  The labor (your's or your mechanic's) would far 
     outweigh the savings.  Also, once the injector has been bathed in fuel 
     for a while, the 2 gaskets ($2) that hold it in place deteriorate 
     quickly and need to be should be replaced at the dame time.  I bought 
     new injectors from Vertex for about $65 each (I think) and was able to 
     install them in about a half hour each.  I had two that started 
     leaking and although I am sure a solid case could be made for 
     replacing all 8 at the same time, my car has been running perfectly 
     for thousands of miles with 2 new ones and 6 originals.
     
     Good luck,
