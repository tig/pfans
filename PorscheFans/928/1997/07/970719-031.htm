Great! The ranks of NYC-area 928 owners continue to swell.

You're in luck. The best 928 shop I know of anywhere, the place to which
the dealers and other independents bring the hard problems, is not far east
of you, in nearby Mineola. This is Autosport Designs
(http://www.smarttrac.com/autosport/index.htm). They do everything from
routine maintenance and fixing of little things to radical modifications,
all with competence, accessibility, and very fair prices. Talk to Tom or
Barry and tell 'em I sent you.

>My PCA application is complete

Great again; send it in right away! Metro New York is a particularly active
PCA region, from which you'll get all the competition opportunities and car
camaraderie you could ask, all on a zero-snobbism basis.

>The car is a blast, by the way

It'll take you a while to find out just how good and exciting it is. Keep
driving (especially on a fine day like today).

>But you all probably already knew that!

It never hurts to be reminded.
