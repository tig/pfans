Went to get the GT smogged today - fun!

Shop after shop wouldn't even attempt it.  The first guy took one look
at the car with it's DEVEK stickers and gave up right there!  No matter
how much I jumped up and down and told them the car is all stock, they
just kept coming up with excuses and referred me onto another shop.  I
went through 4 so far.  The 4th was smogging an XJS so I thought ok,
they should be able to handle this *simple* task but when he saw my
Florida plates, he caved in also.  "Oh, my machine just crashed.  The
hard disk..."  Bullsh#t !!!   CHICKENS!!!  It was up to shop #5  J&S
Auto in lovely downtown SF.

I started screaming at the poor guy before I got out of the car - "I
been all over town!  Do you have the guts to smog a Porsche 928?  It's
all stock dammit!  It's no different from any other car dammit!  It's
got a converter, two in fact!  It's got an air pump.  It's got an 02
sensor.  Big deal OK?"

Well, I didn't need to have read him his rights (and I wished I found
this shop first) because in a hot second the car was wired up and keyed
in.  PASS WITH NO PROBLEMS!  NO BIG DEAL!  In fact, the emissions were
so low I'm doubting it really needs a converter to begin with.

Plus, instead of gouging me like the other shops would've done, J&S
charged me the standard $35 fee plus $8 for the certificate.  I know
it's not  a $19.95 cheapie test but that was shop #1 above!  Kudos to
J&S in San Francisco...

Then guess what else happened?

While double-parked up in front of my house, a 914 stopped behind me.  A
lady came up to my window and said - "hey, you're not Lucky!"  I said no
but I bought his car!  Guess who this lady was?

Mrs. Red McClintock !   She said she spotted the DEVEK stickers and
recognized the car from a distance and just had to see what was going
on!  We spoke briefly and she's going to take a look at 928s4vr.com ,
thank you all for helping me build it - I'll let you know her comments.

Anyways, it was very nice meeting her and I hope to see her again (lives
in North Beach as well I think?)

To paraphrase an old Honda' commercial:

You meet the nicest people while riding a 928

Tuesday's next.  Keep going and the weekend will be back!
Phil
