Hello All,

I am fairly new to this list and still in search of my first 928.  I 
took my first test ride this morning in a 84' 928S.  I almost fell in 
love with this car immediately.  It really was a blast to drive.  
However here is my question:  This car didn't seem to really have much 
low end power or torque.  It would barely break the tires loose under 
full throttle acceleration from a stop.  When the car reached a speed of 
about ~30mph, then the car would accelerate quite rapidly.  Under normal 
driving conditions, the tranmission felt quite sloppy.  I should point 
out at this point that it is an automatic with 81,000 miles on it.  It 
seemed like the shift between 2nd and 3rd was somewhat hesitant.  I 
checked the tranny fluid as this seemed to be an obvious first check and 
that checked out fine.

So does this sound like the tranny is in need of a rebuild or does the 
16 valve engine not have much low end torque?  Would a change of the 
tranny filter and fluid make a difference?

I appreciate any suggestions and advice all you wise and knowledgable 
928 owners can provide.  Many many thanks in advance!!

Timothy Rabe
