What was it then? The subsequent language implies that you had more than 4
bar oil pressure at idle when warm, a pretty high number.

This is pretty familiar territory. Mine shows just over 3 bar at idle when
warm, pegging just above 5 bar at around 2400 rpm on the way up and coming
off the peg below 2000 on the way down.

The former is tempting because it agrees with my experience. Maybe your
(exciting to read about) racing experience cleared your car's pipes.

Interesting observations; thanks for the report.
