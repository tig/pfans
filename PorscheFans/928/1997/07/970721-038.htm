Help...

I just got my car back from service. Basically the car drives worse than
when I brought it in. I had the timing belt replaced (78k miles), clutch
line bled and the transmission fluid changed. 

Before service, there was a little grinding when engaging 1st & reverse. It
wasn't that bad if you pressed hard on the clutch. There was also some
grinding downshifting from 4th to 3rd. All others (upshifting or down) were
fine.

After service, all of the above, plus it seems harder to put it in any
gear! Also there's some shuddering in low rpm range (1500 - 2000rpm).
Mechanic is recommending clutch work (clutch disk, pressure plate & throw
out bearing) for the problem with 1st & reverse. For the problem
downshifting from 4th to 3rd, tear apart clutch to replace sync ring.
ching, ching (sound of cash register)

Before I call him up, I want to cool down a little bit. There was a 3 day
delay in getting back the car. Any tips on what might have gotten screw'd
up?!?

ps. This guy is recommended by everybody around here for working on
porsche, especially the 928. :(   I think he's nice guy but something
happened in the service, plus they didn't test drive it after service.
