Go for it.

My wife has Miata also.

I bought an '84 928 S - went nuts and bought a '90 GT .  Common story of
late as there are a growing number of multi-928 owners...

re: space
fold the rear seats down and you can PriceClub shopping even - plenty of
space.

re: childseat
Porsche makes a seat but n/a in US.  So go find a seat that fits at
Toys-R-Us and save $200.  I take my sister's kids for rides and they
love the tactile feel of the rear speaker grills, rear visors that shade
them, exhaust rumble sound, etc.  the baby is amusing as he hums to the
engine.
