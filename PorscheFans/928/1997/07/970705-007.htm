This approach to doing things is not limited to Corvettes. Panorama has had
some interesting stories about the even-greater lengths to which a shop
dedicated to such things went to reconstruct an 356-era Porsche so as to be
absolutely original, but outrageously (term carefully chosen; PCA has
changed its concours rules because of money-macho abuses such as this)
cleaner and generally more perfect by far than any such car had ever been
when born.

Cars of this sort never roll across the ground any farther than the
distance from the (not just covered but sealed; dust, you know) trailer to
the assigned spot at the concours. The engines aren't even started except
when absolutely needed to confirm that they work. Talk about driving pleasure!

....which can add a few volts to the spark if you raise the hood in the
daytime, but are pretty brittle (or did you mean "silicone"?)

Mmmph, mmph, mmmph! (sound of big-time self-restraint)
