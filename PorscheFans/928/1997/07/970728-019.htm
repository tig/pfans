For the past 4 months, my oil pressure would be pegged at 5+ always
except when the car was fully warmed AND idling - then 4 bar. 
Yesterday, on a trip with the family (our kids love the 928), it changed
so that ~2.5 at idle fully warmed and then rev dependent (going up to
5).  This is similar to all the 951's I've driven (when I was car
shopping).

How do the 928's behave?  My guess is something may have been gunked up
and has now cleared or the sender is going.  The car has been quite warm
(nearly overheated - bottom of red) with sustained high revs at the
track - certainly nothing extremely serious was wrong.

TIA,

(BTW, more debriefing with my wife over Lime Rock revealed more about
the Kim Crumb Weltmeister/Koni package.  She, and 1 or 2 other
spectators, said that my 928 was very poised (one said "hooked up")
through the esses at LRP compared to the 911's that were really
leaning.  This + a 500 mile trip (on the R1's) with the family of 4 with
(minimal) luggage and no complaints.)
