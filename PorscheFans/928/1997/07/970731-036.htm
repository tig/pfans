 Valentine One Users,

To the 928ers who are having Full Alert, and Erratic Behavior with the Valentine
One.
Just got my V1 back from Warranty Repair. I also called to talk to the techinian
to find out what the problem was, it was as I suspected a bad solder connection
to one of the processors. Under certain vibrations, jolts, etc. it caused a lose
of connection to one of the processors and caused the unit to go to Full Alert
and other times caused it not to react to anything. All seems great for now,
will update after trip to NC this weekend.

>We are about to buy a 968 for my "significant other" that has the crest on

>If we can't get together at Rennfest maybe sometime this fall. There is a

>Would really like to see some of the other literature that you have
>pertaining to the 89 models.  I have numerous articles, family tree, tech
>specs and the certificate but little else.  Would love to see copies of the
>Service Guide and to sometime take a look at your Sales and Promotion

>Hope Phil gets your photos up soon, can't wait to see them.

>>You need to get scans of your car to Phil and put your car in the registry.

>>Doesn't look like we are going to be able to attend Rennfest this year.  Got

>>Maybe we'll hook up someday at the same event.  That would be cool.  There
