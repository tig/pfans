Not interested in flaming, just want to learn how to mange my wife's new =
(since April) 81 928. Would be interested in anything you have to teach. =


In my 44 years of driving, like you I've kept cables handy and jump-start=
ed many a car, using pretty much the same method as you, as both jumpee =
and jumper, and never hurt a thing to my knowledge. But having now spent =
nearly 1k on three alternators in less than 1k miles, I have reconsidered=
.. At least two of these were NOT harmed by jumping, because there was no =
jumping.

But, one may have been.

The owner's manual says if you disconnect the battery whilst running, you=
 will damage the alternator.
Soooo.... I figure if the 928's battery is dead, and stays that way (or =
nearly so?) during the jump start, it is electrically non-existant. The =
booster is the only battery, so when after starting you disconnect it: =
pssst: bye bye ~1/2-k.

The master tech at my favorite garage agrees. He sayeth: "Don't do it. =
When a car comes in with a dead battery we never jump start. Instead we =
remove the old battery and put in a new one. Then we check the system."

Also, there is the little matter of that brain at, I have read here on =
the list, $1700. So far as I know, the owner's manual is silent as to wha=
t action at the battery would harm it, if any. Anyone know if the brain =
is invulnerable to, say, connecting the jumpers backwards?

Anybody ever blow a brain by jumping?

Until I learn otherwise, I would jump start our 928 to save life or limb.=
 Otherwise, AAA will earn their premiums.

Interesting that Porsche doesn't instruct against all jump starting. Why =
do you suppose that is?

By the way, what do you figure runs your battery down in 3 weeks? Do you =
think ours would do that too?
