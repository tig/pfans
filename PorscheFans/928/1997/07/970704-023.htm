all of the above to some extent.  The timing belt on the 928 has to be
replace at ~75,000 miles intervals so not has often as on your 944.
Also, we do not have to bother with balance shaft belt.

The timing belt is critical on the 928, especially the 32 valves
engine.  The valves will hit the pistons if the belt brakes...
The belt must be retensioned after 1000 miles it is install and
then every 15,000 miles.

The water pump is not a big problem but it is recommended that it
be change when changing the timing belt just in case.

If you are looking at an 86, you want to check the serial number
of the car.  In the middle of the year 86, the brakes were greatly
improved.  This started at serial #GS861000.  The brakes on the previous
model are adequate even for some racing but the newer version are what
everyone wants (these are the brakes people install as upgrade on their
944 turbo for racing...)

Good luck,
