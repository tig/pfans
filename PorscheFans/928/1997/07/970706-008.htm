928 are very dependable sports car.  With care, you hear people
with 150,000 and even 200,000 miles with few problems.

> Known weaknesses with respect to mechanics, electrical, etc.

The electrical system on 928 is fairly complicated and some of
the "gadget" (thing not required to make the car move) can go
bad on you.  At that point, you need to play detective and find
the place of failiure.

Mechanicaly, the most important thing I would say is the timing belt.
It must be changed after 75,000 miles and retensioned every 15,000
miles.  The belt is critical as valve to piston clearance is not
enough to prevent coli$ion.  While changing the belt, the water pump
and thermostat should be changed just in case. 

People have been arguing about the cost of replacing a clutch.  I 
agree that this cost does not exist with automatic car and that the
automatic transmision (of mercedes-benz origin) is very adequate for
the car.  Personaly, I rather have a 5 speed for the little extra
control
you get, but that is me...

> Availability of parts.

Not a problem here.  Porsche stands behind what it built and all part
can be ordered through the dealer.  Look in Excellence magazine to see
some mail order place and Porsche scrap yards to find some very good
deal.

> Basic differences between 928 models.

Please refer to Phil's page: http://www.928s4vr.com  The model year
you are talking about covers a wide spectrum of car.  If money is not
too critical, get the newest car you can afford.  Porsche is in constant
improvment mode and a car of the same model year produced later might
have
some better part then previously built car.  Personaly, I like the 32
valve
engines so I needed to get at least a 1985 US model (The ROW, rest of
the world,
still had a 16 valves engine).  If I had to purchase another, I would
look into 
purchasing an 86 or newer car because of the 32 valves engine and
upgraded brake
system.

> Any specifics we should know while looking at them.

Get the car you selected inspected by a Porsche 928 mechanic.  A plain
Porsche mechanic is sometime not good enough as most work almost
exclusively on 911.  It is best to invest in a good inspection before
you buy then paying to fix the problem later.

Also, look for a car that has its service record available.  It is nice
to
know the cars history to know what will need to be done.

It will, but that's what this is all about...  You might want to 
go to Phil's web page for a detailed list of all the models: 
http://www.928s4vr.com or go to the FAQ and get directed to his 
page.

PS.   You will want to join the PCA to get information and discount in
some
Porsche part store.  It only cost $36 per year and you get the magazine
Panorama.  This will be money well spent.

PPS. Where are you located?  By posting your wereabout on the list will
enable whoever is in your area to suggest a good Porsche 928 mechanic
near
where you live.
