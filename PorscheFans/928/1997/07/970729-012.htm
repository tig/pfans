Hi All,
Last weekend, I was just curious after talk on 'fans about the factory label in
the rear of the car. I had a look around, firstly under the carpet (well it
doesn't come up because of the factory CD) as much as I could. Looked behind
the tool-tray/liner at the rear, even looked under the spare (what a pain that
is to get in and out) and NO label!

So my question is does everyone have a label in the rear of car? I found one
under the hood/bonnet and that has the factory options. It wouldn't be as
interesting if I weren't the original owner!

P.S. About this Grand National machine. It seesm the GTS would be close to it
in performance. The factory is known to be conservative in performance figures
and my spec book shows:
0-62.5mph 5.7 (not 0-60, don't know how much to deduct here)
1/4mile in 13.7sec.
345HP
369 ft/lb   B-)
3593 lbs    B-(
Replace the electric seats with sports and it would be a close contest!

P.P.S. Also checked my ground clearance 2.75" (not the car to do shopping in!)
