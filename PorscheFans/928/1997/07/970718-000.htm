Want to benchmark your 928?  Ever wonder how it feels to go
full-throttle in top gear without risking life or license?  Made some
exhaust or chip changes and want to verify manufacturer claims?  How
about a dyno dragrace against your buddy?

Thanks to Susan, we have a chance at getting a portable DynoJet for the
Aug. 2nd event!  Since it will be trucked in  from Vegas, this can't be
a freebie but the cost is a nominal $50.  This is a genuine DynoJet and
rare opportunity, especially for those who've never done this before.
The DynoJet will be there guaranteed with a minimum of 10 sign-ups -
please respond to ptong@928s4vr.com by this Sunday evening - we must
notify themMonday!

Every participant gets a print-out of their horsepower & torque map to
save - and who knows, might even be published in a DynoJet ad or
featured in a video!  Heck, bring your own video cam and whip that tape
out next time so-and-so comes to visit!

Again, if you've never done or seen a DynoJet, you got to try it out -
it's way fun!

Email me your sign-up now!
