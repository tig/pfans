Well the list is back on and my brakes are still in acting up.

My boiling theory has be destroyed by many of you and my mechanics.  The 
line is not close enough to the catalyst to produce that effect.

For recap purpose, my brakes have been bleed twice.  The last
time after emptying the system completely after rebuilding the
4 calipers.

The parking brake is not sticking.  All 4 wheels will get hot but
the rear one gets even hotter (but they do not have the cooling
duct that the front one have).

Last time it occured, I stopped the car, really easy at this point,
and pumped the brake with the car on and off.  The pedal feel
returned to normal and my brake unlocked.  The latest theory is
a faulty master cylinder or some of the component inside.  Maybe
a broken spring or leaky piston seal.  This is the theory as the
calipers have been rebuilt and the line checked in the process.

I am told that the booster cannot cause this problem so the only thing
left is the MC.  I still cannot explain why this pressurize the 
system but my knowledge is limited and my frustration high...

Has anyone ever rebuilt an 85 master cylinder?  the parts fiche does
not list any of the internal seals.  Are they available??

Anyone knows of a good (cheap) source for master cylinder?
