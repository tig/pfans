Well, I am out for a cruise and we start smelling this crisp smell.
No its not 4th of july bbq, its brake pad smoke...

I thought the problem was solved, the brakes worked well even Friday, 
but today, almost total lock up...  To keep highway speed (not an area
I wanted to stop in) I had to drop down in 4th gear.  I then stoped 
for 10 minutes to let the thing cool down and the brakes appeared to 
have released again.  Why??

I have a far fetch theory (other than the government conspiracy one...)
My catalyst appears to be very hot.  You can actualy feel the heat
coming through the center console.  The brake line goes by there on
their
way to the back.  Could it be that I have a fuel problem, overheating my
catalyst, which causes the brake fluid to boil, which makes my wheels
lock up?  Does your catalyst makes a lot of crakling after the car
is turned off?

Am I being punished for not flaming cheap non-Porsche solution from
K-Mart?
