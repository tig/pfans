Actually for this situation the solution should be even simpler. There is a 
message ID header which looks something like this one (from Phil's message) 
Message-id: <33D1A8AB.976E5A75@928s4vr.com>. A smart email filter will 
maintain a database of message ID's and automatically delete the dupes. I 
had 318 messages awaiting this morning which filtered down to 51.

For the problem message, filter on its message ID.

I run FreeBSD (genuine BSD can't-say-its-Unix anymore, 
http://www.freebsd.org/) on my home system and use slocal (out of the Rand 
MH package) to sort incoming email. The man page says to create 
..maildelivery.dir and .maildelivery.pag files to enable automatic duplicate 
deletetion, but because MH is distributed in source, and not all Un*x-like 
systems have the same db functions in libc as the man page's author, I 
eventually discovered ".maildelivery.db" was all I needed (should have 
looked at my source code earlier).

Its probable that most of us download our email from a Unix host. And its 
likely most of us have a shell account at our ISP. And if mh is installed 
on that system then you could filter upstream of your modem.

My ISP has MH installed. I've not implemented same there as I have at home 
(yet) until I resolve the issue of refiling mail (the stuff I want, minus 
spam, minus dupes) back into the system mailbox. The issue is how to deal 
with the case where multiple incoming messages arrive at the same time. One 
has to lock the system mailbox on the first message, and wait until that 
finishes before the next is allowed to write to that file. MH (actually 
slocal) relies on an external program to actually place the message. 
FreeBSD uses mail.local (even from sendmail) for this task. Sendmail on my 
ISP uses /bin/mail for local delivery, but in a mode that non-root users 
are not allowed.
