This is a multi-purpose light.  If it lights up for a "minor" problem,
you
can cancel the alarm by pressing the indicator on the center console. 
If
it is a major alarm (ie timing belt tension), pressing the senter
console
light will not cancel the alarm.  There should be another light going on
indicating what is the problem with the car.  If it is the belt tension,
get it fix ASAP.

No other mechanism than the 2 rear shock.  They are easily replaced
after
you remove the little clip that holds the ends in place.  The original
shock have these little wire retaining clips that almost look like they
are spring loaded and would give way if you pulled on the shock.  DON"T
do this!!  Use a pair of pliers and remove the clip THEN take the shock
out.

Just remember, there is no stupid questions, just stupid answers and 
possibly expensive consequences for not asking...
