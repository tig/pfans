Hello 928 P-fans:
This past weekend was spent at a driver's ed. event at a small track in
eastern Ohio (Nelson Ledges).  I got to trcak the '86 928S for the first
time with the Kim Crumb suspension modifications (Weltmeister progressive
spring set from Automotion, Koni "red" shocks, S4 245/45 wheels/tires on
the back, and a complete corner balancing.  What a difference from stock!
Anyway, by the second day, with the help of an outstanding instructor, the
928S and I were really flying (including a little sideways excurison at
about 80 mph - the 928S is forgiving and got back on line with no damage).
This vast improvement in my track times and associated speed that the car
is capable of has gotten me to think seriously about the need for a roll
bar and a pair of 5-point racing harnesses.
I do not want to replace my original leather seats with racing seats, nor
do I want to tear up the interior in any way to accomodate either a set
of 5-point harnesses or a roll bar.
My question to the group is, does anyone know of suppliers of roll bars
and harnesses that are ready-made for the 928 and do not require dispoiling
the interior?
If you have information, please send a message directly to me (and also
copy the group) because I subscribe to the digest version and frequently
get behind in my reading.
Many thanks.
Jim Fry
