Water is not a that good surface wetter.  If you drop a single drop on a
piece of
steel, the drop will keep its shape.  If you put a surfactant in the
water, the 
drop "shape" will change and be in greater contact with the water. 
Better contact
means better heat transfer.  That is also why some people are against
giving the interior
of the water passage a nice polished finnish.  All the little crevice
present create
a larger surface area, similar to adding fins, and help with heat
transfer.

Water is good to transfer heat as it can absorb a lot of it without
increasing
its temperature by much.  It also has a very high latent heat of
vaporisation
(ie, it takes a fair amount to raise a volume of water by 1 degree but
it takes
a very high anount of water to make that volume go from liquid to
gas...)

Cavitation of a pump on a regular basis would be catastrophic for the
pump
itself.  The impeller would self destroy (I AM a chem eng and I have
seen
the effect on pump that cavitate...).  The water wetter does not change
the 
property of the fluid enough to prevent cavitation of the pump.  

I do not think that resonance is involve here in a significant way. 
However,
some guy at MIT building a specialized engine might disagree.  For the
real
world???

those are the moost important thing to check.  The water wetter will 
give you a bit extra heat transfer but the important thing is a clean
system to have good flow, a thermostat that open when it should and open
fully to let the water go buy and a proper size radiator to get the
heat out of the coolant and back into the engine.

That why we are here isn't it??
