Dear Phil, Leonard, Kim, Marc & Susan, Mark, and devoted 928 fans.

The event is set for 9/27 as mentioned in the posting of 7/3/97.
Recently, there were some questions on what a 928 Club would or could or
should be like.
If I can add my 928 cents to the discussion, I see it as evolving into
something like the "356 Registry" or the "Renegade 914 Club", both of which
are still associated with PCA. The function of the club would be to provide
focused information to it's members in the form of a newsletter and provide
a means by which 928 fans could socialize and attend technical seminars
about 928's. Other information about parts, services and even a classified
section could be part of the newsletter.

Naturally, there would be dues and volunteers needed to carry on the
administrative duties involved in running a non-profit organization.

These are but a few general thoughts on the matter. Please feel free to add
you 928 cents.

Happy motoring. Ed
