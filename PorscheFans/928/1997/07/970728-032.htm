The best way to get a new key is to call 928 international.  They will
ask for the serial number of your car and, if the tumblers were never 
changed, you will get the proper "master" key for your 928.  I did it
and it work fine (except for 1 tumbler, the one on the driver's door).

I suspect that the tumbler on the driver's side of my car was forced at
some point.  This would explaing the problem I am having.  I will be
taking the tumbler apart and see where the problem is.

If anyone orders a new tumbler set, I would like to get the old broken
one.  I would like to get the little spring loaded door cap to replace
the one that was tore off my tumbler...
