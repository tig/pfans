I am certainly far from knowlegeable about fluid flow, and I have no
wish to offend, but this sounds like hogwash. Water is extremely good
at transferring heat, and wets metal surfaces well. The water pump
might turn a little easier with lower surface tension, but I don't see
that having any significant impact. Lets say some cavitation occurs in
the pump--so what? It might decrease the volume of water pumped
*slightly*, and it may take a *small* toll on horsepower, but it seems
unlikely to cause much trouble thermally. I think that there is no way
that there is any other source of cavitation--I don't see the part
about "high frequency resonance".

This is interesting, and I certainly believe data over theory. Was the
outside temperature and humidity at the track the same both days? How
about trying it several times? 

What is the engine thermostat doing all this time? Why doesn't the
thermostat set the engine max temperature regardless of additives?

Sorry to rant on about this, but it just doesn't seem to make
sense. I've certainly read many posts from both of you that were well
worth saving. Thanks for the discussion!
