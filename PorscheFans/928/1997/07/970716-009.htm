Math,
If you check Matts original post:

I think this is a little more than "Condensation Moisture" that you speak of,
which BTW I have never seen happen on any vehicle before.

Matt seems to possibly have a very serious problem, and we should double check
the facts and all pertaining "posts" before recommending that he go out and
drive his car to warm it up to clear out the "condensation", and further ruin a
$30,000 engine.

Hi everybody,
A while back the subject of toy and model 928s was brought up.  It seems
that no one was able to find any decent examples of these.  Today while
I was at Toys R Us with my son I was looking at the Hot Wheels cars
hoping to spot a 928.  It's amazing, but I found one.  It is in a
Porsche "Gift Pack".  The gift pack is a cardboard container
(approximately 4in by 11in) with clear plastic on the front.  There are
5 hot wheel Porsches in the package.  4 911 derivatives and the 928.  It
is an early model with no rear spoiler or body side moldings.  The cost
of the pack was $4.99.  Although the color is not the same as my car, I
am going to put it on my desk to remind me what I am missing while I am
at work.  Has anybody spotted a model of the 928 anywhere?  If so please
let me know, I would love to build one.
Thanks,
Chris Trask

PS.  The box has a "collectors tip" which states that there are 3 other
928 Hot Wheels out there.  In 1982 one was released called the "P-928",
in 1984 one called the "Predator", and in '85 & '87 one called the
"Night-Streaker."

PPS. Just a quick note tacked on the end here.  I did try to send this
message earlier and it was only delivered to the "6 members of the list"
after not receiving the list for a few days I resubscribed and am now
receiving the list.
