Years ago I was involved with R/C car racing. I remember seeing a
product, which I think was geared more to the R/C airplane crowd, that
was specifically designed for removing stickers without ruining them. I
don't remember the name or any more details, but perhaps your local
hobbyshop specializing in R/C planes would be familiar with such a
product.

What has worked for me in the past is covering the sticker with masking
tape. Rub it down with your fingernail around the edges, then very
carefully cut around the sticker with an exceedingly sharp, pointed
Exacto knife. This works very well, but be forewarned that you need a
steady hand. Hold the knife like a pencil and rest your hand on the
surface, "drawing" the stickers outline.
