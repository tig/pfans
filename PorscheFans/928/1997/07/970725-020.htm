A couple of the postings are at the bottom of this post.

Yes, the 16V has that little low end power.  Combined with big tires it's
hard to break them loose even with my slightly warmed over 32V motor.

A good start would be a fluid and filter change.

Here's the other posts:

1st one...
---------------------
Larry,

It works like a charm! Push the button and hold it for as long as you'd like.
The tranny will shift to 2nd when the engine reaches about 5400 rpm. If you
back off of the gas pedal before ~5400, you're still in 1st _AS LONG AS YOU
KEEP THE BUTTON PUSHED!_ Yee haaa! If you're coasting down from speed (foot
off of the gas) and you push the button and hold it, the tranny will downshift
to first only when the cars speed falls below about 25 mph.

BTW - you can push the button anytime, any speed, and the tranny will only
downshift if that is safe and possible. It's all controlled internally by a
combination of speed, current gear, rpm and vacuum.

UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS:

 I used a foot switch from a guitar effect. There are other appliances,
such as
sewing machines or dictation recorders, that use momentary contact push button
foot switches. You _could_ just go to Radio Shack [sic] and get a tiny project
box and momentary pushbutton and mount your button in that box. Get some zip
cord.  Give yourself a few feet of zip cord to work with. Solder a connector
of the footswitch to one side of the zip cord and the other connector to the
other side of the zip cord.

Find the wires leading into the stock kickdown switch (located at the base
of the firewall under the gas pedal). Splice in one of the new footswitch
wires to one of the original wires and the other new footswitch wire to the
remaining wire. Insulate the wires with electrical tape to prevent shorting.

Hide the new wires under the carpet as you place the footswitch box at the
lower left corner of the "dead-pedal". Well, that's where I eventually put
mine. I use my left heel to press the button. 

Now, both switches work...but the new switch will hold a first gear start 
without the gas pedal mashed to the floor. Think about it. All that original
switch does is cause an electrical downshift in situations where the gas
pedal is on the floor AND a downshift is possible/feasible. Porsche would
never
design (or accept a design) that could cause catastrophic failure. There's
no chance that the car will drop to 1st at 60 mph! That would violate the
algorithm (speed, rpm, current gear, vacuum).

I just made a mod that removes the pre-requisite that the pedal be on the 
floor.

2nd one...
----------------

> What's a kick down button?
> 

A factory Mustang eliminator device.   (ok Pony fans, just joking!)

Recall that while the earlier 2-speed auto shifters can select 1st gear
manually by the shift lever, the 4-speed auto shifters only have positions
for P R N D 3 2 - no 1st!  Thus the kickdown 'button'...

The kickdown switch is on the firewall directly under the gas pedal.  It's
purpose is to allow full-throttle kickdown of the autotrans for
acceleration, most notably selection of 1st gear (on 4-speed a/t cars) from
a standing start instead of the normal 2nd gear starts (concession to CAFE
requirements for economy).  

Patrick I believe came up with a secondary switch modification so simple
and obvious he will most likely invent something like the next paper clip,
get ultra rich and purchase that last 928 GTS!   See http://www.928s4vr.com
 Performance Mod's section for tons of details...
