Count me in.  Didn't pay much for mine.  I'll pay as I go with mx 
costs though...

I'm in the 2 other cars and house situation too.  Fortunately my wife 
works!

This was exactly my logic.  Although I kept my Ford Festiva for a 
wintertime airport car and a Porsche-in-the-shop car...  Funny that 
we both got black ones too...

I have a great solution to that problem.  I put my wallet in my right

It's neat to see so many people enjoying their youth.  I think of

get to 50 or 60 and look back and say "I wish I woulda..."
