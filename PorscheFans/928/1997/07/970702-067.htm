Ken,
Here's my 928 cents worth.
Nothing I have seen, fits as well and is make as well for your car as the 
Porsche factory wires. I have tried many plug wires that are advertised 
"OEM" but they never seem to have the extra heat insulators and cylinder 
numbers on the wire like the Factory wires form Porsche have !!!
Plus think about this, your factory wires have lasted almost 17 years, see 
if those "Performance Wires" will guaranty theirs that long..
When it comes to Spark Plug Wires (and most other items) for 928s ----
PORSCHE, THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE
