ok, i'll through my $0.02 into this. i've had a couple of old
motorcycles that showed this type of behaviour.

Stephane,

	your problem is probably a blockage in the fluid intake
hole in the master cylinder. inside the MC, just ahead of where
the piston sits when you are not pushing the brake pedal, there
is a tiny hole that leads from the fluid resevoir to the MC. when you
drive the car, the brake fluid gets warm and tries to expand.
normally, it goes out through this hole. if this hole is plugged,
when the fluid expands, it just applies your brakes. find out if
this hole is plugged.
