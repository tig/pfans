This is all easy to understand when you remember that corporate
executives also have above average height.  Since we all know 928's were
built for execs, doctors, and lawyers (my guess is all but these are
above average height), it's obvious that 928 owners will be too tall.

So why did they make them so low!  The later cars (S4 & up) and the very
early cars w/o sunroofs are better.  (BTW, I fit with helmet at just
under 6' 1".)

awards.)
