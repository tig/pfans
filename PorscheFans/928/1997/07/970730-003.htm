Does this label resemble the one on my webpage (see codes section) ?
All the build labels I've seen were under the mat, or, in the warranty
book.   Where under the hood did you find the label?  It's a white
computer printed label, about 3" x 4" ?

re: 2.75 clearance!
Jeez, one pothole in SF and tons of stuff would be toast!  Let's see,
that'd be:
front spoiler, which then takes out the oil cooler, inner fender wells,
maybe parts of the front bumper (don't ask me how I know this) ; a/c
compressor, belly pans, god help you if the oil pan ruptures, etc. etc.

Actually there are driveways and even uphill intersections that could do
this too - sometimes I have to tip-toe around here and it feels like I'm
steering a bull around town!  (My front suspension is a little tired too
so things should improve after the swap - cones, watch out!)

Not that I'm complaining mind you...
Phil
