<<  agree wholeheartedly.  I am 23 and couldn't regret owning two Porsches
and
 various other sports cars in my life more.  Wait, what am I saying?  I think
 I've gone as crazy as the 911 and 928 P-fans list!  Seriously though, it is
 good advice.  If you can't afford to keep up a Porsche then wait until you
 can to buy.  Any Porsche is expensive to maintain properly, and you won't
 find any people anywhere who want to see a Porsche not serviced and kept up
 b/c of lack of funds any less than us.  Good luck. >>

If you can keep up the car, I say buy one, I'm only 19 and have a 928 and
keep up with all the work on it. One ting though, if you do get one you can't
'beat it up'. If you take care of it and keep the work up, you shouldn't have
a problem. Good luck,
