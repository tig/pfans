>>I may replace them with a set of clear white PIAA's...

FWIW, PIAA makes some pretty amazing lights.  I went along on the Feb.
1996 Rally of the Lost Patrol (Seattle-Inuvik-Seattle), and our Jeep had
a set of PIAAs the size of dinner plates.  The wattage was only 140W
each, but they must have some amazing reflector designs.  I've used a
lot of different brands of driving lights on different cars, and I've
NEVER seen anything like this.  I swear you could light a cigarette off
these things at 100yds!  Seriously, though, when we dimmed those lights
for oncoming traffic at night, the first time I dimmed I thought somehow
I'd gone to just parking lights.  We had people flashing their lights at
us at probably 1/2 mile or more.

PIAA's are pretty expensive, but the performance was truly astonishing.
I'd never have believed that these were only 140W bulbs if I hadn't
looked at them myself.  I've run 115W bulbs in my motorbikes, and in
driving lights on various cars, and they're NOT all created equal.
