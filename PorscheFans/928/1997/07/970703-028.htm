Yep. It's easy to do. Luckily, it's usually more sound than fury.

Any obvious damage to the alternator? (Those blades are a simple cooling
fan whose dimensions are not critical, as long as nothing's rubbing or
about to fly off at high speed). Any strange noises when you start up
(aside from the standard whirring of the water pump when cold)?

Yes! it's low up there, partly because the whole car's low, partly because
the front air dam and belly pan are deliberately placed close to the ground
to discourage air from flowing under the car in order to reduce front end
lift at (what others would call) high speeds.

>In the area which I live there are many speed bumps.

With this car, there are lots more. You'll learn to be careful going into
and out of driveways which meet the road at any kind of vertical angle,
drive around rather than over protruding manhole covers, beer cans, and
anything else which sticks up abruptly from the road. This is why people
who drive on surfaces other than billiard tables should think twice about
aftermarket spring kits which lower the car.

Unless you see fluid in a puddle under the car, or have screechy or loud
whirring noises when you start up, or see no oil pressure, this may be
conservative.

>1. Is it common to 'bottom' out a 928

Yep (see above). You make it less common by learning to avoid situations
which will produce contact (by the way, the nose of the car is way too low
to clear the typical concrete bar at the front of some parking spaces. You
should also learn to pull in very slowly and stop short; you generally will
not be able to bring the front tires in contact with the bar, at least
without first having done some dramatic things to your bumper and air dam)

>2. What is the best way to traverse speed bumps?

Just as your neighbor told you.

>3. What does the "Stop Lamp" mean

Usually nothing. The system used to determine if one of the brake light
bulbs is burnt out is hilariously fussy, being influenced by battery
voltage and very small changes in contact resistance at the bulbs' sockets.
The quick test for authenticity of indication is to tap the brake pedal
again. This usually will cause the warning to go out.

Bear in mind that this system is also conservative in that it assumes the
bulbs are bad until it is shown otherwise. As a result, that warning always
comes on when you first start the car and stays on until you hit the brake.
If you pull onto an Interstate from a rest stop late at night (no traffic),
the lamp will just stay on; I've tapped my brakes in such situations just
to be rid of the meaningless warning.
