<< 
 Matt,
 Have you checked the dipstick yet, to see if there is any "milky chocolate",
or
 other abnormal liquids on it ?
 
 Have you been able to confirm you last mesage to me that the "mud" may be
oil?
 
 It also could be from incorrect coolant used by PO, like Adam King said :
 >The "mud" could also just be from internal system corrosion i.e. what
happens
 >when you don't use "safe" coolant.
 
 If it is oil in the bottom of the tank, and you see no weird stuff on the
 dipstick, it could be from a previous "problem" that has been corrected
 (properly I hope), check your service records, if availible.
 
 The main thing you need to find out, is the "mud" OIL or something else. 
 
 PROCEED WITH CAUTION, UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THE FACTS!! >>


I checked the dipstick and it looks fine, just oil, I also checked the 'crud'
I saved that I put in a cup and I grabbed some with my fingers, it was very
dark dark brown and had little rough particles in it. Some of it dried up in
the cup already, I put some on the ground to see how fast it dries up.  The
crud felt like kind of like sandish, if that makes sense.  matt
