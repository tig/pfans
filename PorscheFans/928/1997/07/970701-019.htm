	on advice from Daron Townson, i purchase a set of Eibach lowered
springs for my '79 928. a couple of weeks ago, i installed them.
overall, i'm
very pleased. the ride is not much worse, except over concrete slab
roads,
and even then its acceptable. the turn-in is much sharper, and the
track-out
beahviour, especially under warp drive, is much more predictable. this
is even
though my rear ride height is still a bit too high. it was up to
compesate for a 
slightly too high front height, and my adjusters are frozen. 
	i'm seeing evidence of very slight rubbing on the outer edge of
the
left front tire with these springs, anyone else seen that? anyone out
there
rolled their fender lips?

	i also shortened my shift lever about 1.75". very nice. the only
drawback is
that now that it takes a bit more force to move the lever, its very
obvious that 
Porsche put a rubber shift knob in the car. i'm thinking about a matched
mahogany
wheel and knob to replace the stock ones; any suggestions? MOMO?
Personal?

	if there's anyone on this list going to the Pacific NW Historic
Races this weekend,
bring your 928 out on sunday. look for the chocolate brown one in the
porsche corral and
say "Hi!". we need more that 2 928s out there!
