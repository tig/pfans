Hello,
   I had a clutch put in about 3000 miles ago on my '89 GT. I thought
everything was alright with it but my friend, who is fixing the big dent by a
transit bus, said that the clutch felt like it was shot. He said that it was
grabbing in the middle of its movement, could this feel like it was shot
because of the double clutch and the wieght of the car? Should it grab early
when its released? I don't autocross or abuse the car. He usually drives a
vette so mabey he's used to that clutch? Thanks for your help.
