When you're turning sharply, are you off the throttle (or on the brakes
<gasp>) or on the throttle.  If you're off the gas, it may just be
physics - weight is transferred to the front wheels leaving the rears
dragging and no weight.  Without having been in your car it's hard to
say - your car might be need (front) shocks or possibly some driving
schools (schools are more fun but shocks aren't unfun).  If a shock is
leaking oil (wet & collects dirt), that's a dead give away.  On an '84,
I'd certainly expect that it'll have needed shocks at least once already
- if they haven't been done, use that Nike motto.

Best,
