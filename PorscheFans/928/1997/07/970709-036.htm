<<What is a good source for replacement wheels and sensors?  I'd

appreciate your thoughts.>>

Richard,

Contact Ernie at:

He has tons of factory rims in chrome, polished, painted and factory
finishes.  He's very honest and will get your rims to you ASAP.  I highly
recommend him.  Personally I'd stick with a nice looking factory rim too.
 What about the 17" GTS rim or the 18" Twin-Turbo rim?  I have the Speedline
GTS rims on my 1987S4 and love them.  I was going to get chrome (mine are
factory silver finish) but thought it would look a little tacky on a black
car.  It's all personal opinion though.
Good luck,
Brian Buxton

P.S. Anyone who sells my Lotus for $24,500 will get $500 cash from me!  I
have info and pics for anyone who has interest.
