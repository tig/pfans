Yup, BTDT.  Brakes yes, clutch no - at least I haven't been able to do a
clutch that way.  OTOH, go to The Home Depot and buy the sprayer for
$15, a $3 master cylinder cap at your dealer, and you can make the
contraption.  For me, it was well worth it as my wife doen't much enjoy
the footwork.  Some may however.  The trick with the clutch is to be
REALLY REALLY patient after each bleeding cycle (overnight works for
example).

Best,
