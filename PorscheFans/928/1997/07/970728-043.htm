Now that present really says,  "I love you" !

My first autocross ever with the Loma Prieta Region I met Bob Fooshee
and his wife Marge and they were very nice folks!  I didn't make it back
the next day, but next time I'll be bringing fresh fruit and juice to
return their hospitality!!!

Speaking of which, the next driving event is the Zone AX #7 & #8 but
it's up in Nevada!!!

Following that, GGR AX #6 in Dublin, CA  Aug. 16th.  So pencil this one
in and I'll see you there!  Maybe we'll see more local 928 porschefans
also - Jim Murphy <hint hint>; Philip E. <nudge nudge>; Marc & Susan
<yes???> ; Sparkes (gotta work out all those GT systems dude!); oh man
there's alot of folks we could have our own class!

Hope to see you this Saturday!  Let me know if you need any details -
Phil
