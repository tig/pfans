<< transmittance on the side windows. I dunno what it is for the rears, but
 I have been told that it can be completely black (which mine is...)
 So all you honest, generally law abiding citizens out there, make sure
 your windows aren't too dark, else you raise the ire of the law.

I have had the same promlem many times, all of my cars I've had the dark limo
tint and I have gotten pulled over many times, I've gotten off a lot, (PBA
Cards help a lot), but I also have gotten tickets for them, in NJ, I think
the law states that none of the side windows should be tinted, the rear can
be as dark as you want if you have 2 side mirrors though. On my 928 now I
don't have that dark of tints but have been pulled over 2 times for it so
far, no tickets yet on the 928...  the tints save the interior and hide the
worn leather that seperated from the rear sides, they also hide the 2 -10
disc changers and the extra speakers in the trunk......
