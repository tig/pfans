Hi guys
I told you guys about my problems with loosing power. (3 months back)
And i also told you how my 928-s4 '89 went completely dead on the 
freeway.
So i brought the car to the oficial porschedealer here back in holland
( pon's automobielen in leusden.) to fix the problem.
I was put on a waiting list of course but at least after six weeks
waiting the car was ready....(i tought)
We payed a lot of $$$$$$$$$$ of course, but some one of the other site
of the world told me once, if you want to play, you have to  pay
( I agree)
So I was ready to play , and after five minutes driving the car was 
completely dead again..  So I looked fore the problem my self
and found it. Under the airfilterbox you have a wiretree.
it was making contact with a litle pipe conected on the exhaustpipe.
(I think for measuring the CO.)
So the isolation was melted and tree wires were
making contact with eachother.( like a family picture) I fixed it and 
the car started again. no problems anny more.
BUTTTTTT..... it still is loosing power, and that is pissing me of.
When i find that problem i let you guys know...

greetings from  HOLLAND     AQUALUX yachtsharing and charter
