I finished the polishing on my '85 flat disk wheels last week and while
it's fresh in my mind, I'll briefly report how it went.
The Easy-Off oven cleaner did a good job of removing the anodized finish.
I still had to use fine grit sandpaper to get all of the anodizing off,
though.  Eastwood's polishing and buffing kits come with high quality
buffing wheels and ample compounds for the job, though you can probably
find the stuff cheaper elsewhere.  Each wheel requires several hours work
to get a nice, near-chrome look.
The only screw-up I had was on the first wheel.  After polishing to a nice
shine, I thoroughly cleaned the wheel with soap and water.  After letting
it dry, I began to apply the sealer spray to the wheel, but it was still
wet behind the center cap.  The water immediately mixed with the sealer and
left little bubbles in the finish.  I was ready to bust something up.  I
tried to dab the bubbles before the sealer set up but it just messed things
up more.  I still haven't decided what I'm going to do about it.  It's not
visible until you get up close, but I'll probably strip the sealer and
re-do it.  The other three wheels came out ok, with a nice, reflective
silver finish.
Maintaining and improving my 928 is sort of a hobby, so the time spent on
this task was worth it to me.  I'd be happy to supply further details if
anyone's interested.
