<<Is a battery tender different from a battery charger?>>

Ed,
Yes it is different.  A battery charger will continuously pump a current into
your battery until you unhook it.  With a battery tender all you do is plug
an extension cord into it and go away.  The battery tender "reads" the power
level of your battery and automatically turns itself off and on accordingly.
 It will never over-charge your battery and it will always keep your battery
100% charged.  Just shut your doors (I only shut mine to the first click so
the weather stripping doesn't get de-formed... I have a lot of little tricks
to keep your car nice, just ask!), and hang the extension cord out of the
passenger window.  I also highly suggest spending $300 on a fitted car cover
from Tweeks or AutoMotion.

<<Do you go to all the trouble of pulling up your floor mats and unscrewing
the fuse panel cover frequently to hook up a battery tender?>>

Nope, my Porsche tech hooked the wires up to the car through the fuse box and
we mounted the battery tender on the "shelf" in the passenger footwell.  Easy
access, plus, you can't even see it unless you know it's there and are
looking for it (the tender is a nice black finish).  I wasn't about to get
into the rear hatch everytime I wanted to "plug" the car in... I keep the
tender on the car everytime it won't be used for minimum of 2 days.  Good
luck!
