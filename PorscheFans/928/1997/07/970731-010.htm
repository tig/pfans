In an article back in 1987 someone wrote to "Car & Driver" or "Road &
Track", or one of those similar mags, and questioned the hp per pound of
the current Vette compared to the GN's hp per pound.  With the aerodynamics
of a brick compared to a slick Vette, how can the GN be beating the Vettes
consistently unmodified?

The reply was something to the nature of the low hp figure was so that the
motor would slip by the tranny people.  The engineers in the engine dept.
were told the trans would be adequate for up to approx 250 hp.  So that's
why they lied...to slip it past without any delays.  They calculated approx
295 hp for the standard GN's but I never read what the GNX's were.  I'm
sure in the 325+ range though.  So the torque ratings aren't exaggerated.
Just ask for a ride in one someday and you'll become a believer!

I love driving my 928.  It's my dream car!  However when blasting around
town or below 120 on the freeway, the GN's accelerations is hard to beat!

In another magazine they rated the "fastest cars in the world" in different
categories.  The GNX was faster in the mid range roll on (I don't remember
exactly from what speed to what...I think it was from 45 to 65) than the
911 turbo.  However the 911 turbo was faster in the quarter by a long shot.
 This (faster mid range roll) was due to testing in the real world of
driving in top gear and then accelerating from that point.  The 911 had to
downshift first...build boost and then she ripped!  Due to the auto trans
of the GN, it started to build boost and pull almost immediately.

Also at triple digit speeds the GN starts to require every bit of attention
from the driver to be safe in comparisons to the 928 which is smooth and
safe to the very top end.  But remember the end of my earlier post from
6/13/97...  It said:  "Now the first time I have to hit the brakes or
corner the GN is another story...."

The interior isn't all that bad looking CONSIDERING the source!
Uncomfortable as hell compared to the 928 though.  Obviously they put all
the R&D into the engine compartment!

Below, I've included the earlier post explaining the minor mods to both the
Buick and the 928.

But consider this.  You're comparing a newer 928S4 to the 86/87 GN's
whereas I was comparing my 1985 928S.  Again, with similar mods the Buick
is faster than MY 928S.  I never said it would beat a newer S4 but I'll bet
it'll be a hell of a race!

Old post for those wanting to reminisce!

--
When both were stock, the Buick was faster in EVERY aspect up until the stock
chips rev limiter hit 125mph.  After that the 928 would come up like gang
busters past the GN, but it had a lot of making up to do.  Both are now
moderately/equally modified and the GN will hold it's own on up to about
145 before the 928 stops the GNs' pull.

The ONLY modification to the GN where I had to actually unbolt a part of
the *engine* was to install a lower temp thermostat.  A K&N air filter was
also added as was a test pipe on the exhaust.  Finally a Pit Bull chip
finished it off.  No NOS.  Stock intercooler, stock turbo, stock injectors,
stock fuel pump, all season radials and it is still quiet, gets great
mileage and is still the ultimate sleeper.

IDENTICAL modifications were made to the Porsche with the exception of the
thermostat.
