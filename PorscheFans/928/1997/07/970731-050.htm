	Yes they do make sun blocker for interior products and its called "Aero
cosmetics" Leather care #757.  Call 512-344-7921. Its great stuff. 
	Very interesting about the leather verses vinyl in your Caddy. The only
thing I wonder know is if we cared for the leather and vinyl if it would make
a difference in its durability. My upholterer says 350.00 dollars for 1/2 cow
hide (only no labor) and say's it will do all the dark brown in the car IE
dash console doors and upright pillars. He wants about $275.00 labor. 
	Also you want to ask about the French seems. If you look close at the seems
in your dash you will notice that there are two stitches. This takes a
special machine and very few have them. What most will do is sew the seem
twice but unless they are angelic in nature the chances are the seems will be
wavy. I'm still looking for someone with a fresh seem machine.
