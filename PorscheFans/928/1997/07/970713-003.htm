An OEM battery is prefered if you are going to show your car in Concours
events. However, "Interstate" makes a very good battery for the 928. They
can be purchased at any authorized shop.

Several years ago I saw an article in "Excellence" on a 928S trailering a
small sportsmans trailer (up to 5,000#'s). I can't seem to locate the
article/issue, but it did inspire me to make a trailer hitch for the car. I
did some measurements and had one fabricated by a local metal works shop.
The rear rubber bumpers do have to be removed, but the hitch uses the
existing holes and bolts, and can easily be mounted or removed in 5 minutes.
I plan to have it on for the "Shark Frenzy" coming up on 9/27/97 in Fairfax,
VA. Also, I will be using it to go  to Watkins Glen next weekend for a
Driver's Ed event. I only use it to tow a small utility trailer with a load
rating of 1000#'s. The trailer is good for my track wheels/tires, floor
jack, tools, camping gear, SCUBA gear, etc. Anyway, the only modification
needed was to add a trailer wiring harness for the turn signals and brake
lights.

If you need more info on this arrangement, send me an e-mail.

Happy motoring. Ed
