| Pietro,
|professional testing and engineering was only 175lbs and performance gained was
|only 3 tens of a second in 0-60 . I can tell you how to lose almost that much

|GO BY A NICE GT AND CALL IT A DAY.

Amen, David!

They should have talked to Mark @ 928 International, still can't get over how
he reduced his track car by 1000lb+.

Performance/Comfort is always a compromise. Pietro, seriously think about what
you intended goal is, think about alternatives to the same goal. I doesn't take
a genious to realise this undertaking would be a good way to throw $30-50k
away.

You have email! Talk to some of the 928 companies. You'll find they're not out
to "push" products on you. All I have talked to are as friendly and considerate
as the members of this list.
