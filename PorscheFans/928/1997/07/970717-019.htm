Sorry if you were offended.  I'm sure you are proud of the research and
effort you expended to create your solution (or is it product?).

So-called short-shifters are common-place amongst Japanese cars.  Most
just move the pivot point of the shift lever up a little which often
doesn't really shorten the throw all that much.  I didn't feel the need
to "dimension the part" or "create any geometrical models" just to saw
off 2" of mild steel shifter lever.  Seems a little extreme for an
experiment that can be cheaply and easily reversed.  My error was in
removing the lever.  It was a real bear for me to get those circlips
back on the lever pins while keeping the springs compressed.

Thanks for the free advice.  Gratuitious comments are usually worth
their price ;-).

Why not offer to send one of your short-shift kits to Mark and Susan at
DEVEK? They actively campaign the 928 and may wish to license or market
your product.  They do have an extensive world-wide mailing list of 928
enthusiasts, publish the only catalog of 928-specific performance
equipment and thus would seem a logical place to introduce such an item.
