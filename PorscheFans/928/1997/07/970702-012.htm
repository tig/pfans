Hello again,

	When I first bought my 928, starting it was a roll of the
dice. Maybe/maybe not. 
	The problem was the following: If you remove the panel under the steering
wheel to expose the ignition switch and stick you head under there you'll
see a cable running from what appears to be the engine compartment to the
igition switch. The cabel has a plastic connector which snaps into the
switch and hangs off the bottom.
  	My probelm was that the snap connector was bad and the small weight of
the cable was enough to pull the connection loose. 
	Solution: Mr. tie wrap! ($0.01) I put a tie wrap to hold the connector on.
It Starts instanly everytime!

	I believe at least on my 928 there is a mechanical engineering screw up
wich causes this stupid! electrical problems.
Since the whole instrument panel/steering wheel move up and down you need
to have slack in all of the cables. The guys over at Porsche didn't leave
enough slack. When I push my steering wheel all the way down I see the
cables pulling out of the conectors!!!!!!  Bad engineer BAD BAD
engineer!!!!!!!

I think this is why the previous owner sold this formely temperamental
beast which has now been tamed!!!!!!!!!!
