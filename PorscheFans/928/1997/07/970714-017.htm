<<Yeah, then when it rains the water beads up and you can't see anything! I
have

different wash cloths for the windows so I *never* transfer any wax to the

glass. Easy to clean dust won't stick either like it does on the waxed

paintwork. But of course just MHO.>>

Adam King wrote the above as a response to my suggestion of waxing the
windshield, BUT what he forgot about is that water on a sloped surface will
roll off, esp. when you are moving at 45+mph.  Try it out guys.  If water
didn't roll off the windshield then why is Rain-X still being sold (since it
does the same job as wax).  It seems that if it were that dangerous our
"saviour" the government would have put a quick stop to it's sale.  Have any
of you ever been caught out in the snow or a light rain in your 928 and
noticed that as long as you stay above 20mph the snow/water never touches any
part of your car?  928 wind tunnel testing pays off!!  I guarantee you won't
have to use your windshield wipers... esp. at highway speeds.
