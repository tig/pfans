 Will,
There are a few companies that make a window film with Liquid Crystal
Technology built in to it.
When you apply 12 volts to the film it goes completely opaque and allows no
light to pass through.
The estimated cost for all of the windows in your 928 would be about $2000.
I have used it in theatrical applications and it works great. The product
has been around for about 6-7 years. It comes in pre-made glass laminated
panels or the above mentioned film which is like window tint.

an easy off/on cover that covers only the top and windows?

ever actually been such a thing?

be hollow and there would be this reflective liquid that would pump in. I
see now they have the hollow panes in some new cars, but haven't seen
anything about any reflective liquids. You?
