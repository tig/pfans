928 Fans,
After reading some of the "posts" on our site concerning the K&N air 
filters allowing fine particles into our engines, I was a little surprised 
and nervous.

I decided to e-mail K&N directly about this matter, and included the 
"technical data" from all of the "posts" on this site. I expressed to them 
in a courteous and professional manner my concerns and also that I have 
used their products for many years in all of my vehicles.

It has been 2 weeks since my e-mail (have resent twice to be sure), and I 
have recieved no response from them. This causes me even more concern about 
the K&N filters.

If the information I sent them was incorrect or they had other data to 
contradict the problem of the K&N filters allowing fine dust particles into 
our engines, surely they would have responded promptly (I also expressed 
the fact that over 700 members were concerned about this matter).

Due to this Silence, I am going back to the paper elements and risk losing 
performance (I honestly could never tell the difference , anyway) but 
gaining a longer lasting engine.

I highly recommend you consider the same.


David Roberts, President
