Ed and all others...
You are going to absolutely ruin your battery.  It is extremely hard on
abtteries to be charged and discharged even a few times.  It's not too good
for your 928's many computers either.  Jump starting a 928 should do no more
harm than jumpstarting a 1977 Chevy pickup, as long as you use the post in
teh engine bay for the positive cable and a piece of metal for the negative.
 BUT, why would you want to go through all that trouble?  Spend $50 on a good
battery tender, hook it up through your fuse box in the floorboard passenger
side, and plug your car in when you aren't driving it.  The battery tender
will turn itself off and on as needed, and your battery will stay 100%.
