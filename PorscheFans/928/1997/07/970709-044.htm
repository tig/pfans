Subject: Lamborghini Countach Owner's Experience (LONG)

WARNING: This post is long with only a bit of Ferrari Content.>

Instead of thrashing Joe for his unrelated post, I think we should take
pity on him.  He obviously needs some 928 therapy to get his senses in
order.

< I bought the car through a dealer in Illinois, and I paid $28,000 plus a
1993
Acura NSX in trade.>

What a waste of some serious cash.  He could have kept the NSX and spent
the 28K on a nice 928 GT. 

<Its the kind of thing I've dreamed about for 20 years since I first became
aware of the Countach in the mid-70s.>

I used to dream about owning a Lamborghini or Ferrari.  In fact, the 308
was my favorite car for some time.  I can remember reading a comparison
test in the early 80's that pitted the 308 against a 928.  I was devastated
when I saw how the Ferrari got thoroughly trounced by the Porsche which was
cheaper, more reliable and easier to drive.  After getting over the
disappointment, I came to the logical conclusion  - if you can't beat them,
join them.  The 928 has been my favorite ever since.

<This car is like no other in the intimidation department.  It took nearly
2 months to grow comfortable enough to steer with one hand.>

It took less that 2 minutes to get comfortable in a 928.

<In my judgment, build quality is superior to the Ferraris I've seen and
owned.>

But how does it compare to the build quality of Porsche?

<I'm 5 10", and I have to squat low in the seat with my knees bent on
either side of the wheel in order to fit during racing.  Tall drivers need
not apply.>

It is already well documented how the 928 can accommodate drivers of all
sizes.

<Mechanically, the car is quite simple.>

12 cylinders, 6 carbs.  Simple?   Give me 8 with fuel infection.

<One problem I noticed early on was a bad (nearly engine-killing)
hesitation on acceleration.  I talked with another 5000s owner who
confirmed this problem, and a re-read of several Countach reviews from
80-85 also mentioned this trait.  I found that the acceleration pumps on
the carbs weren't injecting near enough gas on throttle opening.  Thank
goodness for Webers, since a quick alteration of the pump bypass orifice
resulted in about a three-fold increase in gas delivery on acceleration and
completely eliminated the hesitation.>

This is simple?

<The body is 1 mm thick aluminum and is very fragile.>

How much did you say you paid for this car?  

<The fragility of the body makes engine work a bit tricky.>

HOW MUCH did you say you paid for this car?  

<Theres a lot of vicarious joy in watching others see and inspect the car
for the first time.  The most amazing fan was a 9-year-old boy >

Almost every kid loves the looks of the Countach. I know I did.  Most kids
outgrow it though. I mean all of those tacked on spoilers, air ducts and
wings are a joke.  I used to think that a jacked-up Camaro with a blower
sticking through the hood was cool too. Grow up.

Seriously though, I actually thank Joe for his post.  It simply reinforces
my opinion that the 928 is the best sports car value on the road today.
