Looks like I sent the message with my old address. The new one is:
eds928s@erols.com. Hope you don'y mind the re-send.

Attention all 928 afficionados and owners. The first PCA Potomac
Region,"Shark Frenzy" is set for 9/27/97 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at
"Auto Sportsystems Group" in Fairfax, VA. (At last, a 928 only event on the
east coast).

The agenda includes discussions on the brakes, drive-train, electrical
system, exterior and interior care/repair, potential modifications, parts
availability, and suspension components. At least one 928 will be on a lift
for a "hands on" brakes, electrical system, and suspension/undercarriage
discussion. Also, there may be a surprise guest speaker. (He is among the
most respected 928 experts and racers.) Moreover, a highly modified and very
quick 928GTS may be available for our viewing and listening pleasure.
Lastly, there will be a short discussion on the viability of forming a "928
club" that would augment our PCA membership.

The cost of the event, including lunch, is a modest $5 for each PCA member,
and $10 for each non-member. For more information send an E-mail to
eds928s@erols.com, or give me a call at:(703)481-9252 [before 10 p.m.
eastern please]. Registration forms and directions to "Auto Sportsystems
Group" will be sent to those planning to attend. I will need the completed
registration form and a check for the appropriate amount made out to "PCA
Potomac" by 9/20/97.

Hope to see you there and happy motoring. Ed Ruiz (86'928S)
.
