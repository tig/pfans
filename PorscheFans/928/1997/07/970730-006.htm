Coming from you, Phil, this is a real compliment!  (Funny too!)

Is this the silver car on Doug's  registry with VIN # 0029?   That's got
to be the oldest yet, although now that I think about it someone was
selling one here maybe even older?  Anyone save that message?

Later,
Phil
ps.  We're following in Phil K's footsteps too with the '928 Owner's
Club'  - Phil headed up the Land Shark Track and Street Club (lst&sc)
and I've been asking him for his help & advice.  Thanks pkal - we're
trying!
