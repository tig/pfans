My point was that "matching numbers" is the 2nd most important thing to 
most of the Corvette owners I know, 2nd only to the name, "Corvette." This 
applies to both show cars and the cars they drive. To be matching numbers 
they don't have to be the actual part that was shipped on the car new, only 
has to be the exact same model and out of approximately the same production 
batch as *could* have been shipped on the car.
