Your clutch is probably OK, but the hydraulic circuit which actuates it is
not. 
First, check the level of brake fluid in the reservoir; the clutch system
shares this fluid.

Second, if the fluid is old and full of water, hard driving can cause the
water and other contaminants to boil, causing the clutch equivalent of
brake fade. If this is happening, letting the car cool down can temporarily
restore proper clutch operation. The cure for this is what you should be
doing anyway: frequent drain, flush, and refill of the hydraulic system
with clean high-spec brake fluid.

Third, look for one or more leaks somewhere in the clutch hydraulic system,
likely at at least one of the master cylinder and slave cylinder. These
cylinders can also fail internally, not leaking but failing to seal their
pistons.

Your gears are grinding because you can't fully disengage the clutch. If
you leave the current situation alone, you'll eventually get to the point
where the pedal hits the firewall and stays there, while the clutch stays
fully engaged. You can prevent forest fires (and this grisly eventuality)
by following the steps above.
