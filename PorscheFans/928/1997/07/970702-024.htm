Hello yet again,

	A few more things to get off my chest. I recently purchased
a 1982 928 with 66,000 miles and ALL original equipment.
	I have replaced the following, timing belt, both the worn aluminum cam
gears/bearings, water pump, belt tensioner, multiple worn bushings, and all
fuel lines, distributor cap, plugs, all filters, all fluids, the ignition
switch.
	Amazingly, all these parts were from the factory and the timing belt was
ready to shred due to the belt tensioner becoming cocked at about a 10
degree offset. Quite a mess, but all fixed now. (The original owner was
strictly gas & go!)
	My question: my mech. did an overall check of everything else and it
"appears" there are no other major nightmares hiding. What other
preventative maintenance should be done?????

	Now this is also a 5-speed, dbl hyd clutch. When my mech. drained &
replaced the fluid the clutch doesn't seem to want to disengage all the way
or immediately. It still shifts fine but I can't speed shift, I gotta wait
a few seconds between shifts.......


	Does the clutch fluid feed from the brake master cylinder?
	Could there be some air in the clutch?
	How do you check clutch fluid level.......????????

Which one to drive???????? I never can decide.........
