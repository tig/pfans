My guess is that "fully warmed" is a somewhat variable state. I've
noticed that after a hard run on the track on a hot day my pressure
drops to about 2 bar at idle, while on a mild day with normal
driving, it idles at about 4 bar. Water temperature reads the
same in both cases, but obviously the oil temp is considerably
higher in the former case. Considering the temperature in the
Northeast for the last few days, what you're seeing may only
be a temporary condition.
