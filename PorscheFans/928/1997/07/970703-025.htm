Hi,
        I'm sure everyone is tired of my questions.  But I believe I
'bottomed' out my 928.
I think I did it a few times, but I didn't actually check to see the damage
until I pulled
the car into the garage tonight.  It appears that the metal 'shield'
underneath the front
portion of the engine was bent by hitting the road, the bump was around 4"
or so in size.
The problem is I checked from the front of the engine and it looks like the
alternator
blades 'nicked' the surface of the shield.  I've since pushed the metal down
and all 
appears well.  I believe this occurred either at the entrace of my
development or
at the local golf course (speed bumps).  I don't think I slowed down enough when
going over these.  My neighbor who used to own a 928 chastised me - he said
the proper
way to go over speed bumps in a 928, is to almost stop before the speed bump
and then
'inch' over it.  Is this the proper technique? In the area which I live
there are
many speed bumps.  I've decide to garage my 928 until I can have it checked
out my 
the local Porsche mechanic.  My question to the list group members is?

1. Is it common to 'bottom' out a 928, that is have something hit that metal
shield
underneath the engine.  The roads in the NY/NJ area aren't the best and I fear
damaging my car further.

2. What is the best way to traverse speed bumps?

3. What does the "Stop Lamp" mean, displayed on the upper left of the VDO/Dash.
(see previous posting for more details).

Thanks,

-Mike

BTW: My neighbor also told me the proper way to close the hood on the 928 is
to shut
it by placing your fingers on the Porsche emblem and firmly pressing down.
(I was
grabbing the edge of the hood and pushing down).  He said that the way I did it
I could cause ripples/chips to eventually appear in the paint on the front
of the
hood.  Is this correct?

BTW2: I've ordered tbe car manual ($27) from Performance, a car cover ($70)
from Automotion
(Internet special).

85 928S (Euro) 31k (New owner slowing learning how to care for it)
