Hello, I just joined the 928 list and thought I would
introduce myself.  I've got an '88 S4, guards red,
grey leather, sunroof, dual AC, AT.  I bought the car a
year ago with 38,000 miles on it, and I just hit
44,000.  I put on more miles than I planned, because
it's way too fun to drive!  

My uncle had a 928s years ago, and I fell in love with
the car then.  Mine is in near perfect condition with no
body blemishes other than a few small nicks from road
rocks.  The interior is perfect.  You can see pictures
of my car on my homepage at http://www.samos.org/

What else?  I live in Austin, TX, but I'm from Chicago.
There are a group of 928 owners here in town, and we get
together occasionally, which is always a lot of fun. 
I'll be creating an Austin 928 owners web site soon.

My friends all scoffed at me when I told them I got an
automatic Porsche ("Porsh" in Texas-speak).  But when
accelerating from 0 to 100, er, I mean whatever the legal
speed limit is, they completely forget that gear shifts
were even taking place.  :-)  They have all since forgiven
me, especially Kai, who actually got to drive it once!

I'm looking forward to seeing what the list has to offer,
and hope to meet yet more 928 owners.

-Carl Samos
