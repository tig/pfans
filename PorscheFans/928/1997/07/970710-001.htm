OK, that's two votes for child restraints, none for anything else.
It does seem to be an appropriate location for something like
that. I agree that it seems a bit small for an adult harness,
although as I mentioned I saw it used that way last weekend.
A little research in e.g. Carroll Smith's "Nuts, Bolts, and
Fasteners" book (aka "Screw to Win") would be appropriate here.
According to the PCA Club Racing rules, the slight downward
angle would be OK, but the single mounting point for both
straps is forbidden. 

The thing is, I saw an example of the Kim Crumb style bar, and
it is very obtrusive. It should be possible to design something
a lot more compact, maybe using some combination of the shock
mounting points and the mystery fittings, that would do the
job without drilling holes in the car.
