     Hey PorscheFans:
     
     I have a problem that I'm sure some of you have already solved.  My 
     speedometer all of a sudden stopped working completely.  The needle 
     sits on 0 and never moves no matter how hard I press on that little 
     pedal on the right.  In the past when it did this I discovered that I 
     was able to jump start it by pushing/jiggling the trip reset 
     (odometer) button.  The needle would then jump wildly up to the proper 
     speed.  Now it seems to have died completely.  All of the other gauges 
     work well and seem to be reasonably accurate.  Can anyone who has had 
     a similar problem give me any suggestions on where to start looking 
     for a solution?  Feel free to E-Mail me directly if you like.
     
     
     Many Thanks,
     
     Long live the 928.
