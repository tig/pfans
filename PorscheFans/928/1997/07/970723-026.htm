Steve-

Buy a Ford or a Chevy. A 10 year old beater. Really. Unless you have
an awful lot of money available for a 17 year old, you will be in
endless debt. The world is exceptionally good at taking all of the
money you have AWAY from you. Its tough enough to afford a car as a
teenager if you do your own repair. If you aren't planning on doing
your own, a Porsche will become insanely expensive. 

A friend of mine near Denver owns a Porsche parts yard (Ron Redden at
Porsche Plus, a fine place for 911/914 parts). He knows 91x cars
inside and out to fine detail. He drives a Chevy. He ought to know.

Dreams are fine and essential things to have, and sometimes you want
them so bad it hurts. I know. But achieving your dreams too soon can
be a bad thing too. What do you dream about then?

I suppose I'm sounding like an old fart.
