Well, you SHOULD rub it in and I SHOULD have listen.  The only 
consolation I have is that I will have a brand "new" braking 
system after I am done.

Any advice on where to purchase the cylinder?

Any advice on how to get the thing off (from the top or bottom)?
Any other part I should change while I have this thing apart?

Thank you for your help.  Next time, rub it in (gently) so I listen
and save myself some problems... 

PS. The right rear wheel caliper did need to be rebuilt...
