     Great story, Phil. With a bit of practice launching I'd bet you could 
     run in the 13's. Keep us informed of your "decreasing" ET's and how 
     you get there. 
     
     I am 5'-6" also and was surprised a couple of weeks ago when I 
     autox-ed my 91 GT for the first time - - my helmet hit the roof! I had 
     read about other taller people having problems, but didn't think I 
     would have any problems. I like to sit as high as possible for 
     visibility and close to the steering wheel for better control. My car 
     has a sunroof and electric Sport Seats which I've read both contribute 
     to decreased head clearance. I lowered the electrics and adjusted the 
     seatback so my head was positioned in the center of the sunroof 
     opening which worked good for me. I had the sunroof open for extra 
     room. I didn't try it with the sunroof closed.
     
     The car is a blast to auto-x with all of it's power, but will take 
     some time to get the feel for the width and weight of the car. This is 
     quite a change from my most previous auto-x vehicle, a 2700 pound, 
     1.8-liter BMW 318ti Sport, but not too dissimilar to my old '89 944S2.
     A friend asked if the car understeered or oversteered. I said YES! I 
     plan to add a bit more negative camber in the front and use more 
     discipline with the throttle. . .but powersliding is so much fun :-))

It may well be extremely resistant to scratches, but let's hope it's not
extremeley resistant to flexing. Flexible paint is a good thing -
especially on a flexible surface.

Any competant body shop supplier should be able to provide you with a
flex agent additive for whatever paint you decide to use. Mix it as
directed with the paint you spray the bumper covers with.
