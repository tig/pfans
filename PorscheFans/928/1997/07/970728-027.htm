You're on the right track.  The dash caps may be ok for a quick fix, but
they are just thin styrene, look it, and are difficult to install
correctly - I prefer a fitted carpet dash cover if you just want to
cover up the problem.  I pulled my dash and had it recovered by a local
auto upholstery shop with vinyl.  They were able to match the origional
stiching.  My only regret is that I didn't look around long enough to
locate origional German vinyl that exactly matched the color.  The dash
is not difficult to remove - just time consuming.  I believe that 'book'
time is around 11 hours.

A person in my office building with 2 928s has a gold one with matching
gold painted wheels - this may be the Hellbronze color.  His wheels are
the "Phonedial" type 15" wheel rather than the 'disk' type forged Fuchs
16" wheel.  I'm fairly sure this was a factory option.  It may be some
previous owner had the wheels painted because he got tired of polishing
them.  But, I've seen the Fuchs wheel chromed as well.  Ther are threads
in previous messages about paint stripping and polishing alloy wheels. 
There are kits available or you can send them off to be redone.

>> My idea is to strip the wheel paint and polish the disks. <<

There are threads in previous messages about paint stripping and
polishing alloy wheels.  I don't believe they were anodized.  My '82 928
came with polished Fuchs disks and it was a pretty origional car when I
got it.
