Hi guys, I don't know for sure if the american version from
the 928-s4 does have those airflaps in front of the radiators to.
but my car have those flaps fore sure.( 928-s4 '89 automatic)
I noticed that they were closed all the time . I know they have
to be closed in the warmup period, but than they have to go open.
To make sure, I took my car to town and drove around for an hour
to head it up real bad. I looked and still they were closed.
When I put the ignition on,  they close immediate, and when I 
turn out the ignition they open again...... and this all whit a
real heated up engine.
So I tought I found my problem with LOOSING POWER,the car could 
breathe enough. But sadly that was not the case . I think the sender
is dead. can anyone tell me were I can find it and what the problem
could be????????
thanks anyway   AQUALUX yachtsharing and charter
.
