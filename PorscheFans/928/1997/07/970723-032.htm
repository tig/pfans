I've decided to use Dupont's Chromebase 2-coat system.  Why?  Because
the majority of paint suppliers that I've talked to highly recommends
it.  According to them, I don't even need to use a flex additive for the
bumper covers.  Paint technology has changed for the better dramatically
the past ten years.  Porsche does use Glasurit, but you need to
understand that the factory Glasurit formulation is quite different than
the non-factory one.  (.. you will not be able to get the factory
Glasurit anyway...)  There is also a difference between the european
Glasurit and USA Glasurit formulation due to the EPA requirements here.
The Dupont Chromebase paint is expensive; it cost me $300 for 1 gallon
plus the necessary additives.  (but sure beat the $3-5K price that a
good paint shop asked for...) You will need about 2 quarts to paint the
928 though; assuming that you will use a HVLP paint gun.  I decided to
get one gallon just to have some to spare for future touch up etc.  I
recommend that you talk to some local paint supplier and make your own
decision.  Good luck.
