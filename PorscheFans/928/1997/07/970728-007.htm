>I am in the process of buying a 928, my first. The seller of one of the
cars I am interested in  tells me that he had to replace the timing belt
after the "light when on"  Is this a gentle warning (your going to have
problems soon) or   (you just financed your mechanics new pool)
>In addition does "mint" mean something different in 928 speak? the last
"mint" car I looked into had the front end replaced after an accident and
the air conditioner didn't work. Having been involved with Corvettes for a
while (I know I know) I developed an aversion to non stock automobiles.
Does this hold true for 928's as well? in other words when I would look at
a vette I immediately figured out how much it would cost to  redo the
"custom" work done by the previous owner and subtracted thatfrom the worth
of the car.
>I live five miles from the end of the planet and look forward to your
combined intelligence to educate and inform on all matters 928.

Far better it is to dare might things, to win glorious triumphs, even
though checkered with defeat, than to rank with those poor spirits that
neither enjoy much, or suffer much, because they lie in the gray twilight
that knows not vistory nor defeat.
