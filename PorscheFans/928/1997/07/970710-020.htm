Get it from Motorsports Technology in Toronto:  (905) 660-6614.
Owners are Andrew and Margaret Williams, good friends of mine, and
Andy's the best mechanic I've ever known.  Was written up in the BMW
club mag as the 2nd best BMW mech in N. America, some time back.

They were Canada's first distributor of Red Line products, and because
of
their volume, they'll probably get you the best price you can find.
They'll 
ship to you via courier or mail.

>>As I understand it, 75W90NS is the type I need. 

Correct.  I talked to Roy Howell, Red Line's chief chemist about this a
while back, and that was his recommendation for this particular car (for
most non-transaxle cars, you want MTL...but the 928 calls for a GL-5,
and the MTL is only a GL-4).

Just barely shy of 4 quarts for my 1982.

According to John Stapleton, who checked out the manual versions in
Autralia, there are a couple different versions. I don't have the number
designations here at work, but the differences are trivial. The wiring
diagrams should be virtually identical. I have a wiring diagram for an
82 US, but own a 78 Euro. The only differences are were the Euro and the
US differ - e.g. the rear fog light is not shown. Otherwise, all colors
are identical.

Regarding the headlight aiming system, I did some research on this and
with the help of John (again) found that it is a completly closed
system. It cannot be repaired, only replaced. The system consists of two
plungers (one at each headlight), and two silicon-filled lines which run
to the headlight adjustment valve and knob. The entire system can be
(must be) installed as an assembled unit and individual components
cannot be dissembled or replaced. I beleive the cost is roughly $300,
but it cannot be purchased in North America. You would have to purchase
the system from a European or Australian source.
