Ignoring BMW 8xx's for the time being (can't spend that much concentration
on the rear view mirror at speed, you know...), the resale value thread is
interesting.  On the one hand, we used Porker buyers get Ferrari/Aston/Lambo
crushing performance with reliability for about the price of a new Hyundai
(loaded).  We buy knowing that there needs to be a commitment to regular and
-- no getting around it, no matter how handy you might be -- expensive
service, plus the real possibility (if we take advantage of the car's basic
200,000+ mile longevity) of astonishing repair/ replacement costs for major
components when they eventually do wear out or break.

OK, then, at what point does an enthusiast of reasonable financial sanity
start asking if the continued investment in a car now worth circa $10-$15k
(& plummetting) makes sense?

My personal plan for my late-86 5-speed -- formulated pre-purchase  -- is to
take my now 100,000 steed to 200,000 miles, then strip it as a (barely)
street legal racer, using the sale of good parts to finance the mods.  This
plan assumes that the 928's most problematic parts (electrical, interior
trim, 300# of wires, relays, hvac, etc) would come out, leaving just the
stout heart & soul of the beast intact.

One assumption underlying this plan is that there is no reasonable way to
keep what must be a daily driver in truly pristine condition (vide: Phil
Tong's cavalcade of pulchritudinous porker photos!)  It seems that a number
of us on the 928 Digest are able to keep their beasts as occasional toys,
but that's not possible for me on an arts administrator's salary.

Given the amount of discussion about current 928 owners trading up to S4's,
GT's & GTS's, it seems that some of us are facing these issues.

Comments?
