I should've said this in my last post - Sorry.

The only way I like to do this is to remove the battery from the car,
charge it, then re-install it, and start the car.  It is the ONLY way to
be entirely safe for the car.

If you have some charge on the battery (dim interior lights), then I'd
bump start it (assuming you too are a 5sp).

In the YMMV department,

I'd prefer connecting a separate battery (booster - not in another car)
to jump, start the car, turn on the high power goodies, and then
diconnect the booster - it shouldn't be taking much current if it's
fully charged.

If you're stuck in a bad place on the highway, I'd jump it anyway I
could from another car unless I thought I'd get killed doing it.

(Usually you will not have a problem with any of the methods - you just
want to be sure you never have a blown computer box because of a jump
start.)

That YMMV thing,
Kurt
