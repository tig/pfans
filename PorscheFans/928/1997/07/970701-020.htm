Yup, they have but it isn't available in the US - it does exist from UK
and German dealers for about $200 plus shipping.  We needed it quicker
than we could afford the shipping.  I've included e-mails I've recieved
on it.

In august, Porsche NA will start selling a child seat for the 911's and
so it should fit.  Haven't heard a price but I'd guess it'll be less
than $200 (compare that to the price of shocks or tires and it's way
cheap).

I managed to take a Fisher-Price seat, remove the bottom recliner arm,
and then carve a lot of plastic off of the side to clear the panels on
the "outside" of the car (not the console - left side on driver's side
for example).  I then mounted an additional seat belt from the rear
shock nuts behind the rear seat back rest and it is very secure.

Disclaimer:  Do any fabrication with great car and confidence.  I may
not have had a clue about what I was doing (and you might not either).

Kurt, sorry for the delay in replying.  Yup, we bought a Porsche seat,
but we did that in Germany.  It comes in 3 main parts, and depending on
the child's weight, you don't need them all.  We only needed 2 pieces,
total cost about DM170 (about $125).  Problem is, in the US you can't
get this seat.  I think the only option for us here is to order through
a dealership in the UK called AFN.  I have attached text from a previous
email I sent about this seat a long time ago.  It probably has more info
than you want, but it's easier for me.=20
I'm not sure about the phone number for AFN.  Another list member tried
to reach them recently, and apparently the phone number didn't work for
him. Maybe it was just his problem.=20
Hope this helps!

Just to add a bit to what's below:  AFN is a large Porsche dealership in
Chiswick, England.  Their phone number (from the US) is
011-44-1-81-742-7700.  In the spring of 1995 they wanted 175 British
pounds, exclusive of VAT and shipping, for the car seat I describe
below.
-----------------------------------------------------------
To sum up, as far as I know no one has come up with a US-made car seat
to fit the rear of a 911.  Some folks have bought them from AFN in the
UK, but AFN now says that the seats available now require 3-point belts.
When we were in Germany October 1995, we bought a car seat from the
factory which fits perfectly in our 1979 911SC, and as a bonus can be
used as a booster seat in any vehicle. This seems to be what AFN is
selling now.  It consists of four pieces, each sold separately:  a seat
bottom, a backrest (that straps to the seat bottom), a shield or table
that the seatbelt passes through and secures the child across the thighs
and midsection, and an insert that fits under the seat bottom
(928/944/968 only).
The parts you need depend on weight ranges:  for 9 kg to 18 kg you need
all the pieces, for 15 kg to 25 kg you don't need the backrest, and for
15 kg to 36 kg you only need the bottom.  The part numbers are: 000
802021002CZ for the seat bottom and 000 802041002CZ for the table.  We
didn't need the backrest, so I don't know that part number or the cost.
The instructions say that you need a 3-point belt, but the salesperson
told us we didn't, so I didn't realize it until I got home.  In use, I
don't see that the 3-point belt is really needed when used with the
table and the seat bottom.  You are supposed to thread the lap belt
through a couple of hooks on the seat bottom, then the table, and then
fasten it to the seat belt buckle.  This secures both pieces of the seat
and fastens the table snuggly against the child's body to keep him/her
from flying forward.  In this respect, it looks much like a typical US
booster seat.  The shoulder portion of the belt comes up through the
center of the table, but that puts it several inches away from the child
depending on his/her size.  I don't see that it does much good there.  A
lap belt only seems to work fine to fasten the table and hold the child
snuggly in the seat.  To me, it looks safer than many US booster seats.
However, I don't think I would want to use this seat with the
inertia-type two-point lap belts that I think were put in the late-model
911s.  They may not allow you to cinch things tightly enough.
For the higher weight range, the seat bottom serves to boost the child
up so the conventional seatbelt is more effective.  You definitely need
a three point belt for this.
The factory told me they would not ship to the US, but maybe things have
changed.  You could try calling the parts department at (0711) 827-0.=20
The table and seat bottom cost us about 85DM each.  If the factory won't
ship, maybe a German dealership will.=20
Sorry for this disclaimer, but:  I doubt the European seats are approved
by DOT, NHTSA, etc.  Also, I am not advocating using the above child
seat against the instructions with only a lap belt.  Do so at your own
risk.
Hope this helps.

A friend of mine in the UK:
I've just been in contact with my local Porsche dealer to ask about a
child seat for your 928. Yes they can get them (Part nos. 000 802 021
00, 000 802 031 00 and 000 802 041 000 for reference). Apparently they
are available in either dark grey with a subtle "Porsche" logo print or
with black sides and a grey/ blue/ yellow/ pink fleck inner (Yes,
apparently it looks about as bad as it sounds. Prices? Well the
three-piece kit comes in at Sterling=A3 140.18 (You don't have to pay tax=
)
though apparently shipping will be IRO =A360 (Though that depends on how
quickly you want it!) This price equates to about US$ 225, so I don't
know how this compares with what you'd pay over there.=20
Anyway, they are more than happy to take a 'phone or fax. order and
charge it to your credit card if you should desire to go ahead. The
dealers are:

I just spoke to a dealer up near my parents called Evans Halshaw. The
seat
is in four parts. All kids need the base and back rest which together
cost
about GBP90.00 I believe. For smaller kids, certianly up to 9 months and
maybe beyond there is a recommended table which the seat belt attacxhes
too. This is another GBP40.00. Finally the booster cushion to raise the
child up is recommended because of the shape of the seats - that's also
GBP40.00. No problem on availablility on any except the booster cushion.
Probably the easiest way for you to deal with threm is to give them a
call
on +44 121 352 0911 or to email them on parts@evanshalshaw.co.uk - they
seemed pretty on the ball and helpful. Obvioulsy they'd have to work out
shipping costs. One point worth bearing in
mind is that if they ship to a company then it may
well be possible to avoid the VAT (sales tax, 17.5%).
