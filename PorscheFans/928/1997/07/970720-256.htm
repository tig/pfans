We bought a 1981 928 in April 97 near Detroit, it needed an alternator =
and battery immediately. Put in a new
Porshe battery, and  rebuilt Porsche alternator at ~$170 the part only, =
bought in Detroit.

Drove it ~ 500 miles, it stopped charging. Guaranteed. Got another rebuil=
t  from same company. Drove 15
miles, stopped charging. Installed another, a rebuilt at $450, part only,=
 from a Porsche dealer, here in our
local area, which is New Albany, Indiana, suburb of Louisville Ky. Instal=
led by our favorite shop, Byrne's
Garage, of New Albany. So far have driven ~30 miles and all's well, excep=
t we can't completely enjoy driving it worry free.

We know it had one replacement, at least, before we bought it.

Our mechanic has checked everything he knows how and can't find anything =
that is harming them. He
thinks that its just a case of the two we bought at $170 were not well =
rebuilt.

Also we noticed that the dash ampmeter appears to read low by about 2 amp=
s. So our mechanic put a
known current to it and says it always reads 2 amps low. We have conclude=
d it is merely an inaccurate
meter.

When alternator number 4 went, the ampmeter was jumping from 0 to about =
0.5 amps on a regular beat of
about 2 jumps per second when the engine was running at 1500 rpm or faste=
r. And stayed at 0 when the
rpm was slower.

On another newsgroup, we got a suggestion that maybe there is an intermit=
tant short or gap in the long
cable that connects to the battery, and to look especially for damaged =
insulation where the cable leaves
the battery box. This made sense: the owner's manual says disconnecting =
the battery while the engine is
running will damage the alternator.

So our mechanic checked that. He pulled and tugged on the cable (with an =
ohm-meter connected) to see if
maybe it is broken inside the insulation. He looked everywhere the insula=
tion might have failed so the
copper might be touching ground. The entire cable appears fine as do all =
the connectors. He disconnected,
cleaned and retightened  the connections at both ends, even though they =
already looked just fine. Also,
before alternator #4 went out, he had already installed a new insulator =
cover between the battery box cover
and the positive post.

We have confidence in Byrne's, but still concerned. We can't afford 250 =
miles per alternator.

Any ideas on what else we might do?

Irony is I am a graduate electrical engineer! I can't figure it any way =
but as our mechanic does.

In my opinion, the engineer who designed the system violated Murphy's law=
 outrageously. How many AAA
tow drivers would know that if he jump starts a 928 with a totally dead =
battery, then disconnects the booster, he has blown the alternator?

Also, I am not so sure that the battery would have to be totally dead. =
Disconnecting the booster from a
very very low battery, immediately after a jump start, sounds like it MIG=
HT be risky.

Does anyone know how to change the design so that even if there is an ina=
dvertant disconnect, there'll be
no damage?

Does anyone know if, in addition to the danger of an open connection, a =
short, or disconnecting the short,
from the battery cable to ground will also damage the alternator?
