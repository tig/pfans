  FYI, I asked an EE friend how the tire pressure sensors in my
  "new" GT wheels work:
  
>>      You asked about the tire pressure sensors and how they worked.  I 
>> believe most are piezo-crystal based sensors that are constantly 
>> monitoring the pressure and stick out a few mm outside the inside 
>> part of the rim.  A small inductive pickup is fixed on the wheel 
>> knuckle and the sensor passes by with each rotation.  If the reading 
>> from the pickup is too low, it sends a signal to the warning light.  
>> They've become quite popular as they are standard equipment on 97 
>> Vettes and a majority of the CART and F1 racing teams use them to 
>> detect a slow leak to prevent a blowout due to tire overheating or a 
>> crash due to poor handling.
> 
>>>  Does this mean that the sensors in the wheel actually "broadcast" a 
>>>  signal for the short distance between itself and the pickup?  Or is
>>>  it a magnetic field or something?
>
>> It's a magnetic field I believe (I could be wrong).
