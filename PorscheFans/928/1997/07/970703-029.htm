Probably not, since it happens in other cars (e.g., mine) without any
apparent effect beyond annoying the driver. It's more likely to happen in
hot weather and seems to be related either to the heater fan (for the
inside of the car) or to the system which controls the big electric fans
which come on when needed to move air through the radiator.

What you're hearing is one of the car's many relays clicking. These relays,
plus your fuse panel, are conveniently (hah!) located at the front of the
passenger footwell, so it's reasonable that the sound should seem to be
coming from the passenger door.
