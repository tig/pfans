     Thanks to David Roberts for suggesting the Proto brand Model #C474 
     notch adjusting tool (2 inch to 4 3/4 inch) to use for adjusting my 
     spring perches. I called a local tool supply house (General Tool and 
     Supply in Portland, Oregon) and they had them in stock for $34. When I 
     picked up the tool the guy asked me if I was planning on opening a 
     fire hydrant. I smiled and said I was adjusting springs on my Porsche 
     and he gave me perplexed look in return.
     
     With a few squirts of penetrating oil and light taps with a hammer, I 
     was able to break loose and rotate the adjusters with relative ease. 
     The adjusting tool has about an 8 to 9 inch long handle which gives 
     good leverage. I had the car on jack stands with the front wheels 
     removed to lessen the spring force and be able to measure perch height 
     changes as I wanted to lower the right and the left side equal 
     amounts. My approach was to lower the front and not change right to 
     left weight balance, but only shift weight from front to rear. At a 
     later date I still want do an actual corner balance.
     
     My local dealer (Sunset Porsche in Beaverton, OR) allowed me to copy 
     10 pages regarding wheel alignment from their workshop manual (as my 
     manual is on BO) for reference. I lowered the front perches 10mm which 
     translated to about 20mm at the wheel arch height. My '91 GT has the 
     baby blue Boge Gas struts.
