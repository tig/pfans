You need to remove the center console.  On my '83, it is held down with
a nylon tie; the self-locking type.  The sensor was pushed against the
dash quite tight.  There is also a small tube attached to it; one end of
the tube is hooked up to a small blower motor.  You can remove the glove
compartment box to access it as well, but its much more difficult to
R&R.
When installing the new one with a nylon tie, I gave it some more play;
about 2mm behind the dash and the sensor bezel.  This will allow the
sensor bezel to flex with the dash when the sun hits it.  (This is what
caused the bezel to crack to begin with... the sensor is mounted too
tightly against the dash.  When dash expand due to heat, it put pressure
against the sensor bezel.)
