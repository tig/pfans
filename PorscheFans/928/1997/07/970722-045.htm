I saw this happen once before...it was due to one of the email addresses
in the list having been split by a mail server, which then couldn't
identify either half of that address as a valid mail address.
Unfortunately, that mail server software retried transmission of the
WHOLE recipient list, and not just the two bad halves.

It seems to me that the mail server was an older version of CCMail.
