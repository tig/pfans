Yes a child seat will fit in the back perfectly.  Have to find the right
one though.  The seat belt is actually in front of the seat instead of
behind the back.


In a pinch at a wedding, I was <underline>legally</underline> able to
squish two adults in the back seats.  Small kids are perfect!  Grocery
bags are perfect, just remember to belt them in so they don't go flying
if you have to make an unexpected harsh stop.


As far as a modest amount of luggage....well if you have a wife and one
kid... ie..luggage space for three is pretty tight.  Especially if it's
for a cross country 5 days + trip.  If it's just a weekend jaunt then
it's ok.


It was the car of my childhood dreams and I wouldn't give it up for the
world! :)
