Ken,

I agree with John - shouldn't be gear dependent.  On any of these, the
very first thing to do is to try to isolate the problem.  The tests that
immediately come to mind are:

Car stopped, clutch out, trans in neutral  - driveshaft and tranny input
spinning

Car stopped, clutch in, trans in gear - above stopped, throw-out and
pilot spinning

Car moving, trans in neutral (noise rpm independent) - wheel bearing or
output of trans/diff

Car moving, trans in gear, clutch in  - you figure it out 

....

Think about what's going on down there and use all your weapons to
isolate it.  Usually there's 2 things possible but one is more likely
and, anyway, there all in the same area.

Made this mistake myself,
