Tim,

  Is your car an 85 or 86 with LH-Jetronic?  The cars with L-Jetronic ('83-'84
(and perhaps '80-'82)) don't have the wire mesh at the bottom of air filter
housing.  I _believe_ the wire mesh is part of the mass air sensor used with 
the LH-Jetronic whereas L-Jetronic uses an air flow meter which has a 
pivoting flap at the base of the air filter housing.

John, 

  Regarding the idling problem on the '84 S, a few suggestions that I could make
are to 1) check for a good electrical connection to the air flow meter by
removing the two bolts at the base of the air filter housing to gain access;
2) verify that there are no false air leaks between the air flow meter and the
throttle body (large 8 cm o-ring) as well as between the throttle body and
the plenum (9 cm o-ring) 3) check ignition components (cap, rotor, plugs, etc.)
and timing (as well as vacuum advance operation) and 4) check for a good
connection on Temp Sensor II (on top of thermostat housing). 

  I think I have a failing Temp Sensor II on my '83, and while doing some 
testing the other day I unhooked its lead while the car was running and the
engine immediately died.  (I guess I made the ECU unhappy?).  Anyway, I get
the impression that a bad Temp Sensor II would have adverse effects on idle,
acceleration, etc..
