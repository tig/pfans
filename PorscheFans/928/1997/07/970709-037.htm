<<Would anybody tell me why you Pfans bought a 928 instead of a 911.
 Performance, looks,

dependability, quality???>>
Stephan,
Can't help you as far as why I chose one over the other because I didn't.  I
have both a 928 and a 911.  Seriously though, I find both cars beautiful in
their own right.  But you have to remember that they are two completely
different cars created for two different reasons.  911's are all-out sports
cars- they are hot, rough riding, sort-of uncomfortable, but handle & drive
wonderfully.  It takes a true car person/nut to drive a 911 everyday.  928's
were built as grand-tourers, and you won't find a car as fast that's as
comfortable.  They (mine anyway) are very fast, smooth driving, comfortable,
etc.  If I had to choose one over the other I'm not sure I could.  Both turn
heads equally well, but of course most people are more familiar with the 911-
and no I'm not one of the air-cooled is the only true Porsche types.  I love
them both equally.  They both have exceptional build quality and paint, and
both are extremely reliable as long as you stay on top of the service and
preventative maintenance.  As far as what to get I would probably suggest a
928 for you (you didn't tell me how you are planning to use it).  As always,
try to purchase the newest model you can afford.  I noticed that you were
looking for an 80-85 model.  I prefer the 87 and newer 928 simply for the
fact of the new body and upgraded engine, brakes, technology, etc.  You can
find the 32 valve V-8 and big brakes in the 86 model 928 though.  If you need
to know anything else feel free to contact me at this E-mail address or at
(812) 464-8777.
