Gentleman,

Whatever the number. =20

Per your thoughts on tire pressure gauges, Etc.  I have checked the =
pressure with 4 different gauges and the pressures all register within =
..5 psi.  The gauges that I use are manufactured by Racer Walsh and are =
the bleed down type.   Therefore the tires are not hyper-inflated.=20

Also, the alignment cannot be the culprit, as the wear is in the center =
only.  It is not asymmetrical, but quite even.

Once again, my question is very simply relative to the original Porsche =
pressure specification of 44 psi.  =20

This pressure does seem to allow the best handling chassis. =20

Therefore, It must be a normal trait for the rear tires to wear in the =
middle.

Of course, this could be by tire manufacturer. I am currently using the =
Goodyear Eagle NO tires on my car as these were on it when I purchased =
it.  =20

When the tires need replacement, I will be probably be changing to =
Bridgestone's latest item as supplied on the current Turbo 993.

However, my question stands, is this tire wear pattern a normal =
occurrence in the 928.

Thanks for any information,
