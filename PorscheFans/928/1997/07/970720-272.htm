I don't see any reason to pass up a cherry 85 of 86.  These are the =
first of the 32 valve engines which are substantially more powerful than =
the 16 valve motors.  I think the key is buy the newest one you can =
afford.  Be patient, maintenance records are a plus. =20

1987 was the year of the major body change that went to an even more =
aerodynamic front and rear bumper covers etc.=20

Go to phil's site to compare the features for yourself.

I have started my look for a 928 to buy but have heard that the '85 & =
'86's=20
should be passed by. If this is true will someone please explain why?=20
So.... I guess that my look will start with a '87 S4. Any one wishing to =

sell just e-mail me at mailto:pcpower@nb.net. BTW, I live in western=20
Pennsylvania which would make my task easier, but will travel some to =
look=20
at your car. Also, if you have any pictures just send them via e-mail.

Thanks for any help.
