Did you read the article on the 911 RSR restoration either in Pano or
Excellence?
The guy actually imitated the "sloppy welding" in a similar fashion as
the
factory.  The guy would not detail the procedure because it was HIS way
of telling
a real RSR from a fake/converted one.  Now THAT's anal retentive...  I
also
remember reading of someone preparing their car and made sure that all
the
philips screw head were "aimed" the same way.  They also did the same
thing
with the bolts on the engine and elsewhere (who cares about factory
torque
anyway for true to factory).

I hope this is the last of the wire debate.  Because we will now have
to debate the "quality" of a set of 16 valves wire set that has been
sitting on the dealer's shelve for the past 12 or more years compared
to some home made concoction with new material...  If the guy is happy
with the stuff he made and it works great for him, good for him.  He
might have been able to save enough to put new brake pads with the money
he saved.  If you think that the original BERU wires are necessary in
the
long run, I cannot argue with you either.  I was very pleased to see
some new wires in my 928 when I bought it.  Does this mean that the car
was
well maintained?  Absolutely not!!  You already heard some of the story
on my brakes and wiring. Just imagine the story I did not tell you
folks...

Leonard!!  Maybe is infinity is in Excellent shape and is 928 was sold
by 
someone that had no clue of how much the car was worth...  It happens. 
And
I hope that when I want to upgrade to a newer 928, There will be someone
without a clue trying to sell me a 928 GTS 5 speed at a cost I will not
dare
mentioning to anyone else...
