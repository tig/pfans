A well-known culprit on the circuit board would be the rivets close to
the center of the board.  I found that two of them was loose enough to
break electrical contact with the copper pad.  I tapped the rivets with
a hammer and punch to get a tight connection and then verify continuity
with a meter.  (Do not use a five-pound+ hammer.  This would be BAD.)
:-)

I would also suggest that you slightly tug on the wires that goes to the
three connectors.  (.. which plug into the instrument cluster.) You just
might be surprised as to how many wires will come off!
