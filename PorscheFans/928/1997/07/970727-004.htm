 Ed,
I just sent my VAL1 back to the factory for repair. I got it in Jan. and had
problems with it going to full alert for no reason at all from day 1. I
could even put it under a coat, etc. and it would continue at full alert
until I turned it off. Other times it would not show any alerts. It did this
in three differant vehicles, even in my Jeep which has no computers at all.
Val Research said they could fix the problem, I should have it back soon and
will check to see if the full alert problem is gone. I will advise you of my
tests upon receipt of unit.
