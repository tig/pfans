I'm experiencing a cold start problem on my 85. The car starts but 
stumbles and stalls out after a couple of seconds. When the weather is a 
little warmer it can usually be coaxed along with the go faster peddle 
but is not terribly happy about it. On the second or third try it will 
usually hang on by itself but runs rough until it warms up a bit. If its 
real cool it my even backfire a couple of times when pulling away. Anyone 
have any idea's? Sounds like a typical cold start valve problem but as 
far as I know 85's onward don't have them! I figure it might be one of 
the temperature sensors. Any advise or previous experiences?

Another symptom that may be related, may be not, is that the transmission 
shifts are rather harsh when cold. I'm obviously referring to an 
automatic. A stick shift would actually be my preference but a semi bum 
knee precludes that in rush hour traffic. The only connection to the cold 
start problem I can think of would be a possible leak in the vacuum line 
between motor and transmission. If that were the case why does it shift 
fine when it warms up. I wonder if I'm missing something obvious here? I 
assume the feed is for a vacuum modulator. Anyone had one go bad? What 
were the symptoms?

Dumb question of the day. Is it a 4 speed or 4 speed plus overdrive? I 
definitely get 4 different shift points even with very little applied 
throttle that doesn't come close to closing the "go even faster" switch. 
Perhaps there's a short somewhere which may explain the harsh cold 
shifting. I guess I can check that out easily enough this weekend.

Thanks in advance for any responses.

Colin
