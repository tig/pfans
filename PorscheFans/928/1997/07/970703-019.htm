  In case you do have to remove the door panel, here are some excellent
  removal instructions that Vince Yu provided for me a while ago.
  
Jim S.
'83 928 S 5-speed (U.S. spec)

-------------------------

Pry off the door knob cover.  I used a small putty knife against the 
ridge's edge and the plastic button cover.  DON'T PRY BEHIND THE KNOB. 
THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO REMOVE IT!  Remove retaining screw and pull out 
knob.  Use your palm to put pressure against the round piece and rotate 
it counter-clockwise.  Remove recessed screw behind door handle.  You 
need to slight open door handle to see and access it.  Pry off small 
panel piece close to door handle area and above arm rest.  Open arm 
rest compartment and pry off  plastic nut caps and unscrew bolt.  Go to 
hinged-side of door.  Remove the circular ventilation plastic piece.  
There will be a plastic nut caps and bolt; remove it.  Lift arm rest 
assembly off door panel carefully.  You'll see a bunch of wires going 
to the mirror switch assembly.  Disconnect it and note the wire color 
and where it is connected.  Pry off panel along side of door and lift 
it up off the lip on top of panel.  I suggest that you get a panel 
removal tool from your local parts house.  Cost about $6 and will 
prevent you from damaging the door panel. ($$$)
