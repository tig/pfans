My insults were in response to e-mail from a few who had insulted me for
making my original assumption. As you will note, I did say assume. These
were the same types of insults I got when I brought up the disscussion of
Synthetic oil and viscosity, using 30W oil as opposed to 50W. I got e-mail
basically saying I was an idiot. Until I got the URL for Mobil and it
confirmed my assumptions about synthetic oil.  Asking stupid questions is
what this group is about. We are here trying to find answer so that we don't
make stupid (costly) miistakes  <(hehehe).
Vocabulary error (Mistakes)

My original post was as follows:
If the 928 got any lighter it would fly. I had a buddy who purchased a new
Z28 Camaro. He went to take it to top speed and the car lifted off the
ground and turned over (too light for high speed). The whole front end
lifted like he was drag racing. I like to heaviness of my 928.  I feel safe
at high speeds.
About a year ago I saw a local accident between a 928 and a american made
sedan. The 928 cut the car into two piece (just like a Shark). The 928 was
damaged but still  in running condition (he drove off later).
I was traveling to San Diego on a windy Santa Ana (wind gust, blows down
branches and sometimes power lines) day in my 928S. All car and truck were
traveling at 45-50mph because the wind was blowing car and trucks out of
their lanes. I was traveling at speeds in excess of 80 mph. The 928s did not
even budge laterally. It cut through the wind and held low to the ground.
I assume that the weight of the 928 is by design. When traveling at speed in
excess of 150 mph or more you do not want to be lifting off like a 747
(boeing).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------
My original note was telling of my experience with my 928 and a friend who
overturned his Z28. From then on I got a flood of e-mail calling me an
idiot. I did not major in Physics so , obiviously I needed some
enlightenment. (Business Major). There is a way to go about intellegent
debate and some of these guys, rather than enlighten, they want to take out
their agressions on you. There were a few who were very informative. Some
got insulted because I did not sign my name.  I was told to get a life, go
take a vocabulary course.People such as that who pick on the details to find
a flaw are not good people to debate with. They throw insults rather than
stick to the subject and enlighten. I wanted to be informed and I got called
and idiot and all types of names. Heck, how do these guys expect to learn
anything without intellegent debate.
Now that I have whined a little can I ge a group hug (hehehe).
Thanks again
Tim
