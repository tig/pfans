Assume:
$ = $1,000

Therefore:
$$=$2,000

or 

$$=$10,000

Pick your comfort level for backup repair cash!

Hmm, well an '85 requiring the later would be 'totaled' so I would say
work like the dickens over summer, save up the $2k cushion, then if it's
the 928 you're still after enjoy shopping during the fall/winter
downtime.  Might get a better purchase price to boot!?!

There are at least two other fairly young owners on the list.  I
wouldn't have made such a good young owner and probably would've either
wrecked or blown it up in short order (too irresponsible at that age,
some say even now!), which is what I did with my first three cars.  

Thank god they weren't 928s!

Note also this is not the car that you can plop a cone filter on, swap
pulleys, NOS, etc. easily when those 'stang and camaro owners want to
play king of the hill.  I do applaud your interest in the 928 though.  

FWIW, I was 18 also when that 928 first rumbled by and my brain started
short-circuiting!  As I recall it was a really shiny gold, phone dial
wheels and no spoilers.  It took practically another lifetime before the
dream became reality but boy did the time pass.  Who knows, someday you
might buy my car!?!
