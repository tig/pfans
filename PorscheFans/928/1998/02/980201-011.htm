This is a long post.  If you don't like long posts, just delete it.  =
It's an article
I wrote for "Bespoke" when I bought the 928 and some people may enjoy
it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------------------------------

It's funny how seemingly insignificant events can cause such a major =
change in your life? your situation? even your personality.  Sitting in =
the lounge at home one evening after a serious curry frenzy, my next =
door neighbour, a Ferrari owner and enthusiast, thrust an AutoTrader =
magazine at me. He pointed out one particular car, and said "That's what =
you should buy.  It'd suit you perfectly."   I laughed a lot and made =
another cup of coffee, but over the next couple of days did a little =
reading about these cars and started to think maybe he was right.  I'd =
never wanted a Porsche - in fact I was looking for a BMW M5 at the time =
- but this 928 5 speed seemed like some sort of an idea.

The particular one for sale was in Napier, 280 miles away, and looked =
like it might be something quite special.  Part of a small production =
run, with trick suspension and capable of over 170mph and 0-60 mph in =
5.3 seconds.  I doubted all this, but phoned the seller anyway.   "You =
won't fault it. It's black, and very, very fast.  Come and look at it.  =
If you don't buy it I will pay your airfare home."   We talked a little =
and it became apparent that the price was flexible.  It also became =
apparent that he wasn't QUITE sure what was special or different about =
the car.  He refered to it variously as a "Sport", a "GT" and a "Special =
Equipment".  I said I would phone him back, and asked if he could =
provide any documentation to show that it was the special model.  He =
thought he had something somewhere and would fax it to me.  Nothing =
arrived.

On that Friday afternoon I decided to fly down that weekend to have a =
look. I phoned him and organised him to meet us at the airport.  The =
only flight on Sunday with any seats on it was the 9:30am one, and the =
only one back was 5:30pm.  I booked tickets for Vivienne and I - return =
tickets - and phoned the owner back.=20

"Bring a bank cheque and you can drive it home"  he suggested.=20
"We haven't settled a price yet."
"Okay - bring it for 10 grand less than I'm asking and I'll take a =
personal cheque from you for the balance."

I got to the bank at 4:15pm and managed to get a bank cheque drawn.  I =
was starting to think it might happen.  By Saturday I was driving =
Vivienne totally nuts, burying myself in books on Porsche and making =
brrm- brrrrm noises.=20

Sunday morning was awful weather; a normal Auckland weekend.  But it was =
worse in Napier.  At 9:30 they announced our flight would be delayed an =
hour due to fog in Napier.  Vivienne sedated me and we sat peacefully at =
the airport. I phoned Napier to say we would be late.  He had already =
guessed that we might be as he couldn't even see his gate.  At 10:30 =
they cancelled our flight. Everyone rushed to the counter to re-book, =
but I knew there was no point as all the flights for the day were full.  =
I confirmed that and got my cheque for the tickets back from the =
counter.

"Oh well," sighed Vivienne, "Maybe during the week?"

Oh no - I'm too busy right now.  I got on the phone and organised a =
private plane from Ardmore, a smaller airport on the other side of =
Auckland.  I confirmed that we could just sit in their office until the =
fog cleared in Napier and then they would take us there. =20

At 1:30pm we were sitting drinking the flying club's coffee when we =
heard they had closed Napier airport for the day.  I phoned the seller =
again:
"If I pay for a rental car home for you, will you drive up to Taupo and =
meet us there?"
"No problem - I will get a mate to follow me up and run me home."
(Taupo is about 100 miles inland from Napier.)

The pilot was happy to take us to Taupo instead.  As we were heading =
south he commented that even Taupo was marginal due to Ruapehu spitting =
barbecue fuel into the sky and we may have to turn back.  I said that I =
was happy to try and get in as long as he was.  I wasn't going to let an =
erupting volcano stop me now!

It was freezing in Taupo.  The pilot left and we waited for an hour at a =
very cold airport.  I phoned Dr. John, a fellow Lotus nut back in =
Auckland to fill in time, and told him what we were doing.  He phoned me =
back a couple of times after looking through his motoring book =
collection to find out if there was any such thing as the car I hoped I =
was buying.  The car arrived and I drove it around a little, crawled =
over it, liked it, wanted it.  After all - it was 4:30pm on a cold, wet =
Sunday and we had no other way of getting back to Auckland.  We were 180 =
miles from home, with over 300 horsepower in an unfamiliar car, it was =
dark, raining, we had no idea what the tyres were like in the wet and we =
had just half a packet of Minties left.  Fortunately we were not wearing =
sunglasses.  What the hell!  Yeah - jumping in the deep end.

It was a VERY hairy trip home.  The rear tyres were pretty low on tread =
and trying to overtake was a nightmare.  The accelerator was a bit =
sticky and a number of times I just ended up fishtailing in the wet and =
giving up on gaining any ground in the traffic.  And there was a lot of =
traffic, as we were on the main highway from the ski-slopes back to =
Auckland and it was the end of the winter school holidays.  We called by =
Ardmore to pick up Vivienne's car and at 9:00pm I was very relieved to =
reverse the black car into the garage between the 535 and the Lotus.  =
Half an hour later we'd turned out the bedroom light and I sat up and =
then got out of bed again.  Vivienne understood:  "You need one more =
look before you go to sleep... to make sure it's real, don't you."

I knew it was a risk, but it hasn't missed a beat since.  A tune-up and =
a new set of Bridgestones transformed it into something extraordinary.  =
A magazine turned up in the mail about a week later from the old owner.  =
An article about the SE, with some real road test figures.  100 mph in =
12.7 seconds and stuff like that.  And by then I had confirmed that it =
was the ultra-rare SE we'd hoped it was, too.  I was going to take it on =
a run around the East Cape a couple of months later, but Vivienne seemed =
keen to go in the Lotus Seven, so I decided to lend the new car to =
someone else for the weekend.  And there was Dr. John with his hand up:  =
"Pick me! Pick me!"
