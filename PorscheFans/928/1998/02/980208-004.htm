Hi,
I've just subscribed to your lists, so I'll do "the right thing" and
introduce myself, my name's John Littler, I work in the IT industry as a
middle manager for IBM in Sydney, Australia. I am very shortly to finish
the ground up restoration of a 1963 Jaguar Mk2 and am starting to think
about my next project. I am currently considering 3 options - 
1. an early 80's 944turbo
2. early to mid 80's 928
3. a 924 to restore and heavily work over - ie body kit, engine mods
(supercharge/turbo etc)brakes,wheels

I'm looking for a reasonably hard-edged sports car - I have a modern Jag
for a daily driver so driving pleasure takes precedence over luxury for
the new sports car. On the other hand I don't want something so taut
it's more like a go-kart. I prefer these 3 over the other Porsche models
mostly because I like the look better than the 911 styled series, but
also because I'm more comfortable with the front engine configuration
(and hence handling). 

What are the primary differences between 944 and 924 ? so far I'm aware
of: multivalve 4cyl vs 8 valve, wider wheel tubs, updated interior,
spoilers. 

The 924 are dirt cheap here whereas the 944 (turbo or not) is relatively
dear, hence I can really only afford a very early 944. A 924 goes for
less than $10K Oz dollars, a 944 between 25K and 60K, for the price
difference and looking at doing a lot of the work myself is it worth the
extra for a 944 ?

The 928 is also a very nice option, I've been told that they are closer
to the GT (grand tourer) end of the spectrum than the 944 which is
supposedly sportier, is that a fair comment ? The 928 is in the middle
of the price range between the 924 and 944, the older ones are cheaper
than roughly comparable 944's but the S4's (which are way out of my
price range) are quite expensive. Is there a reason the 928's seem to
devalue quicker or was the S4 such a significantly better model that it
held it's value better than it's predecessor 928. Does the V8 have
significantly more power than the 944 or is it just more torquey over a
wider rev range. Are the 944's particularly peaky in their delivery (as
most of the "hot 4's" I've come across tend to be)? 

Thanks for your help

John
