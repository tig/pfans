Dear Friends:

My thanks for all the response I have been getting concerning the
problem with my headlights...I wanted to write back and repay the favor
by telling you of a great place to get high performance tires for your
Porsche.

I was running with four Toyo 225/50/16 and two were totally burned out,
so I started calling the local tire stores and outlets like Sams club
only to discover to my dismay that most of their prices were way
expensive...

I tried used tire stores and even attaching ads to internet want lists,
I was determined to save my money!!!  So luckily I ran across a company
in Indiana called "The tire rack"....sorry, I don't have the phone
number, but you can call 1800-555-1212 and get their toll free number.

I just purchased two Dunlop "Z" rated tires for $70.00 a piece, and they
only charged me $10.00 for shipping.  These tires are going for $125.00
a piece in the tirestores.  So if it's worth waiting a few days to save
fifty...call "The Tire Rack" in Indiana.

If there is anyone out there who has moneysaving tips, parts
wholesaler's, etc. I am sure everyone would love to hear about it,
because let's face it, there are wrecked Porsche's all over this country
with parts in good shape for a lot less than retail, we just need to
talk to each other to get a handle on them.

Thanks again!!

Mark
