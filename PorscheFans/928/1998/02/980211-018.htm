Sounds like Farmer's wasn't much help there....just a note on Geico,
however:

Geico buys radar guns for police departments, and REQUIRES minimum
ticket volumes from those departments, or they take the radar guns back.

Of course, they also have a hefty surcharge for ticket-bearing
customers...but
who doesn't.
