> 1. How do I (change the manual trans oil)? 

   1. Obtain a 17mm drain plug hex-socket. (Plews makes one that costs $5.)
   2. If you don't have an air compressor, obtain a suction gun or devise
      a means of getting oil to flow uphill.  (Plews also makes a 1 pint
      suction gun for $10).  If you have an air compressor, see the included
      instructions that Roy Vernik developed.
   3. Put the car up on jack stands.
   4. Loosen the FILL plug (midway up the rear trans cover)
   5. After you're sure your FILL plug will come out, drain the oil at both
      the rear of the trans (below the fill plug) and the front of the trans.
   6. After the old oil has drained, replace both drain plugs and refill with
      ~4qts of 75W-90 (GL-5) oil using your suction gun or the air compressor
      method.
     
> 2. What should the current fluid be replaced with (GL-5??)?

     Since you don't change this oil very often, opt for a good synthetic
     like Amsoil or Redline.  Redline recommends 75W-90NS if you have a
     limited slip.
     
> 3. What are the pitfalls/problems I should look out for?

     Not making sure you can get the fill plug out before draining the oil.
     
> 4. How often should this be done?

     ???  I changed mine after 15Km/6yrs.
     

   
   ----------------------------------------------
   Roy Vernik suggests:
   
   I came up with an easy - quick way to do this .  First attach some
clear vinyl tubing to the end of oil bottle.
Place tube in the filler hole. Hold the oil bottle upside down.  With
an ice pick - or  whatever is convenient make a small hole in the
bottom of the bottle.  Place the nozzle  of a compressed air gun into
said same hole.  Turn the pressure down to no more than 20 lbs.
Gently squeeze the trigger and watch the new gear oil flow up the
vinyl tube into the tranny.  No mess. Quick . Done deal.
   ------------------------------------------------- 
   
   It's a pretty easy job on your car.  I think it gets trickier on cars
   with PSD.
