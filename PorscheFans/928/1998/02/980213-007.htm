I shall ask for your colllective patience whilst I vent upon a subject which
we all hold near..if not dear...
First, allow me to state that I live in Tampa. "America's next great city..."
Which is fine except that you must be mad to not leave your house past dark
without a handgun. Tampa exceeds every other medium to major city in three
most important factors':
	a. Stupid haircuts
	b. Gen-X/Hip-Hop slacker knuckleheads
	c. Rusted out, lowered, alarmed, throbbing sound system'd, 20 yr   			old
Toyotas' which the owner believes is actually an IMSA proto-
		type GT-1 car which has been allowed on the street due to it
		being camouflaged as a rust-bucket. All this...and wheelie bars
		too!!!
The archtypical senario(as experienced again last evening)goes something like
this..I'm tooling along in U-928 staying with the traffic flow(sorta !)
when the unmistakable sound of a Japanese 4 banger with screwdriver holes in
the muffler wafts through Wagner's Ring Trilogy(ya know, just where the elk
are flying through the Black Forest). At this point, either the offending
member's headlights disappear from my rear view mirror because he is 10mm from
my rear cap, or the driver has requested assistance from the Blessed Virgin
and is filling every conceivable and not so conceivable slot with Japanese
oxide and recapped Pep Boy's tyres. On city streets this situation is more
annoying than anything else, except for the fact that I KNOW the other driver
doesn't have a lick of insurance. Yeah, you could win a judgement but show up
at the guy's house with a Deputy and you'd end up with a "Symphonic" stereo
complete with "air suspension" speakers & 8-track deck, a selection of crack
pipes, and his collection of Jesus-on-black-velvet paintings.
On the highway the situation takes on a decidedly more sinister aire when
you're in the left lane in light traffic doing 100-110 when suddenly out of
nowhere,  some pinhead is scrambling through traffic in the right lane in
order to catch-up to you to demonstrate to his girlfriend the corelation
between fast driving and sexual prowess. In instances such as this, I will
generally fallback about 100yds...... until a safe hole opens up. Then
telegraph the engine room for ramming speed. Full Ahead!! Rig for Depth
Charges!!! I beleive that I must hold the record for "Shrink-Factor" speed
passes...Victim: '79 RX-7. 'Exotic Dreams" decal filling up the entire rear
window, lowered,fat low profile Cooper tyres, "Caution:racecar in tow" sticker
on rear bumper, Tito Puente blasting through Spark-o-matic speakers, victims
arm hanging out the window, the only contact with the steering wheel...his
wrist.
After passing on his left at 145mph, I expect he hung-up his MacDonalds hat
and had himself admitted to a Psyciatric facility...
