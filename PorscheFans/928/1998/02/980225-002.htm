Mark,
Glad to hear all is working out well.  The Tire Rack has both an Internet
Web site www.tirerack.com I believe, and also advertise in Road and Track,
Car and Driver, and Motor Trend, and often have even huge sales on certain
types of tires.  I'd probably have bought the last set of tires I got
through them, but for the fact I was working at a Firestone dealership and
got mine for cost, plus I had the great satisfaction of mounting and
balancing them myself to know that they were done right.

Andrew
