I have an 88 S4.  It had 12K miles on it when I got it two years ago.  The
belt tension light was comming on occasionally.  The dealer said that even
though the mileage was low, an eight year old belt should be changed.  But I
sorta got screwed.  I paid about $550 to chaange the belt... then was
charged 175 to retension it 1500 miles later.  What I should have done was
taken the 60,000 mile service package for around $800 which includes the
belt and follow-up retension visit, AND does a whole lot more, like all
fluid changes, etc.  If you have a choice.. take the package.  On the topic
of oil consumption.. mine uses very little.  

hope this helps.  keep the shiney side up  :)

88 S4 27,000 miles and climbing.

    <I'm looking at a 85 928 with 23000 miles - excellent condition.  The 
     <owner said that the timing belt hasn't been changed yet.  Does 
    <changing the belt depend on the mileage or the age?  Is there anything 
     <else that I should look at?
     
     <Thanks
