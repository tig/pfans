	Gentlemen (& Ladies) - I have a problem with my driver's side
power window.
	A few days ago I rolled it down, it dropped about halfway and
then slide
	completely down into the door. On attempting to roll it up I
could hear the
	motor running but observed no window movement. My actions thus
far have been
	to remove the inner door panel where I found that the regulator
arm had
	popped out of the horizontal  track which is attached to the
window. The
	white plastic bushing which was attached to the regulator arm
had broken
	into three pieces. I have ordered one from my local dealer but
have no idea
	how to install. It appears as though it was molded onto the
regulator arm at
	time of manufacture. Has anyone had this problem before and if
so is there a
	solution other than hooking the horizontal track on the metal
portion of the
	regulator at the tip and running the window up and leaving it
closed
	permanently? Thanks in advance...

	Why bother?  Just cut a piece of Lexan to size and bolt it shut!
:-)   Just kiddin..  The roller's axle shaft has to be removed.  I just
grounded the stamped side and punch out the shaft to remove.  Replaced
with new roller and tack-welded the shaft back on.  I did it myself
because I have a welder.  Your local machine shop should be able to do
it for you.  By the way, the axle shaft can be purchased from the dealer
if it is worn also.  Let us know how it turned out!
