Ken P. said that he had some play in his rear wheel bearings.  I had the
same condition on my '86S.

Turned out that the PO had changed the driver's side half-shaft, and
hadn't torqued the axle nut properly, so I needlessly changed the
bearing. The procedure is in the FAQs.

BEFORE YOU CHANGE THE BEARINGS, try torquing the axle nut. Get a good
32mm socket, short extension, and a torque wrench that can handle 400
lb/ft. Pop the center cap, put the car in park for an auto, or for a
five speed, use reverse if you are torquing the driver's side, first if
the passengers side, and lock the parking brake. If you don't trust your
parking brake, have someone hold the footbrake on hard - I wouldn't want
to break the parking pawl on an automatic. Torque the nut to 322 lb/ft.

The rear wheel bearing is a split inner race, and a low torque will
allow movement and noise. Been there, did that, didn't get the T-shirt.
