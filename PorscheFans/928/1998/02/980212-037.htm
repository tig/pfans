I've got a few more questions on the cooling sytem. 

1- Water wetter: Those of you who use it what percentage of water/coolant are
you using? I live in So. Cal. and I am considering using a 60% water 40%
coolant plus Water Wetter. What do you think?

2- I've also been considering a 75C Thermostat. Will this hinder performance
of the fuel injection sytem?

3- What does your Temp. Gauge read? Mine typically reads 5/8 to 3/4. Never
quite hits the white line in the 5 o'clock position. Is this normal. I'm
trying to prepare for summer heat. I didn't have the car last summer  so I'm
not sure how it'll perform.

4- I have a K&N air filter that PO purchased. Checked it yesterday, when
putting it back on it seems to be slightly too small to fit in the filter
housing. I even tried stretching it slightly. Is this normal? I checked the
model #, seems to be correct.

BTW- Steve Taub Porsche in Santa Monica, CA was recently selling 928 manuals
for $236. Just had to get 'em.
