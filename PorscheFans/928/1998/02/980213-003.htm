So couldn't a person just use less. One drop of loctite red (242?) makes a
small patch that functions similarly to Nylok (tm) nuts. I purchase set
screws like this for use in production applications. These screws have a
small patch of nylon let into a small recess in the threads. I would think
that a small amount of loctite removeable product should function in a
similar fashion. I'm a model airplane guy and we use this technique all the
time for engine mounts (hardened steel cap screws tapped into aluminum).

What about star washers or something like that? Is it only vibration that
is the culprit?

PS...
Does anyone have a procedure for removing the oil pan/oil level sender
while the engine is still in the car? I have heard alot about jacking up
the motor but am wondering what else you have to remove to accomplish this.
Is there a good source for the oft-mentioned windage tray? (Devek?$)
