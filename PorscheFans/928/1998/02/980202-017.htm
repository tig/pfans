I do not recommend adding any additives but you must admit that the
guy from Red Line had to say something on that line.  What if the
chemical stuff (we still have no idea what the stuff is) is the
best thing since Red Line Oil (they do make great product an my 
tranny thanks them everytime I shift) but it is covered by a patent?
Then, they can't use it.  At that point, you tell everyone not to
use the stuff until the day the patent runs out and you can add it
to your own oil.

I guess the discussion of additive should start with: Do you recommend
this stuff.  The second thing should be: the chemical composition is...
and say why this stuff should make your engine works better.

This is how we can tell folks not to use stuff with teflon (ptfe).  The 
original manufacturer, DuPont, told people not to use the stuff in
engine
because it decomposed and can make hydrofluoric acid (very bad stuff).

I guess I should have just let this series of posting die, but I just 
could not resist...
