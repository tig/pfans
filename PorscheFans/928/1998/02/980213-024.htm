	Axle tramp should be livable with new shocks, hey this is not a drag 
car.  If you wanted a toy drag car go get a Nova put in a big block and 
set it up to do nothing but accelerate in a straight  line!  There is a 
good book on the subject, How to make your car handle by Fed Phun (I hope 
I got the name right).  You can set your car up to do anything but not 
everything, a good drag car can't corner, a good stock car has a hard 
time going in a straight line.  A 928 does everything better than 
anything else, you can get beat at a drag by a kids Nova, but you will 
pass him in a corner, and he won't beat you by much in that drag!

	No starts, if it runs fine most of the time I would start by taking out 
the alarm.  The factory manual has a procedure, remove alarm and relay 
then add jumper where relay went.  One of the functions of the alarm is a 
no start....   Another possible source is the switch on the automatic 
box, manual box's don't have this feature.  Some other cars have a no 
start switch on the clutch pedal.   I took out my alarm after it went off 
3 nights in a row, middle of the night, HONK HONK!

	If you adjust your spring hieght (ride hieght), you will need a 
alignment. I raised my sagging car with sport srings, those are supposed 
to lower the car, but mine was really sagging, so it went up!  Anyhow all 
4 inside edges were worn badly in a few weeks, didn't matter tires were 
done.  If you have good tires, you might want to let the alignment shop 
adjust the ground clearence.

	Stephenie did you replace that radiater cap?
