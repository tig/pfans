If you can find a used catalyst, you might be OK.  But I think its not
leagal to sell used catalytic converter everywhere (or was that used
Oxygen

Probably not.  If the car was let down, you might need a new oxygen
sensor
(known as Lambda sensors with Bosh).  You should be able to get a new
bosh sensor at the local part store for $50 to $70 (this would be a 3
wire
sensor).

 Does any

20W50 is right for this car.  The manual recommend something a bit
lighter
if you run the car in cold weather (might be the case now in New York)
