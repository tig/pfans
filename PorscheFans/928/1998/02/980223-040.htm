Gee, I was thinking more along the lines of Porsche's $70,000 cars vs.
others' $20,000 cars. :-/ There's not that much time difference,
particularly considering Hurst has been doing this since the '60s even
with those long long levers.

Probable. I'll let youse know after CV boots, steering rack, A/C oddities,
etc., etc. <sigh> I'm hoping a little rebuild will do wonders for my
fun-to-drive factor, but mine is the best 5-speed I've experienced in
a 928. Granted, I did look at a lot of clunkers.
