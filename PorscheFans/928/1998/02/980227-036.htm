 I respectfully disagree.  I have several friends that are running 500hp 
2.5L 951s.  They are daily drivers, that are have no discernable negative 
"manorisms."

 I definitely agree with the need for low-end torque. (A short while ago 
I had a Roots blower @ 7.5lbs on my 4V car -- now THAT'S torque!)  As far 
as costs, it depends on where you are starting from.  For daily driving, 
torque is it.  However, if one has other "top-end" needs, other solutions 
might be considered.

 Hm. Opinion noted. Lord knows what you think of Patrick, then.

>Out of 2.5 liters or even 2.8 or 3.0?  NO WAY.

 Yes way, Ted.  2.5L = easy 480hp (crank);  Sheesh. What's the big deal?  
This is proven and reliable, why debate this? My friends (and I) live it 
every day.  I have two friends at this power level. In fact, one of them 
is preparing to go to 3.0L for about 575hp.

 There are a variety of solutions out there for less than that.  One of 
my good friends owns ProtoMotive Engineering, Todd Knighton.  They
