Last night on IRC there was a happy little banter going on, amidst
Matt running out to try doing different things to his plug leads and
Greg seemingly refilling his coffee every five minutes.  The small,
mysterious and elusive Phil Tong arrived and was in mid dialogue
when suddenly he exclaimed "Oh shit" and hit his enter key many
times to clear his screen, then logged off the channel.

He returned a few minutes later with a sheepish explanation:

"It was reflex.  My wife got home and I was scared of being caught.
It was only after I logged off the I remembered that I WASN'T on a
sex chat line...."

Old habits die hard, (so to speak!) eh Phil???
