Basically, yes. The hook with later 928s is that their computer-controlled
engines can adapt to inadequate gas, primarily by retarding the spark,
which reduces power and "snap". With these cars, the issue is how high you
need to go before the computers will do no more to advance the spark.

My car's manuals ask for 92 octane gas. What I usually put in is labeled at
93. Sometimes, I go to Sunoco and put in fuel labeled at 94, and can't say
I've noticed a difference in performance or response. This leads me to
suspect that Porsche knows which end is up, and its recommendation for any
given car is probably that which will deliver full performance.

Sounds like unleaded regular (at 87 octane) will do it. Bear in mind,
however, that some brands of premium are not only higher octane but also
contain extra goodies (like cleaners for fuel injectors), so a tankful of
the good stuff may be useful every now and then. Trick question: what does
your owner's manual say?
