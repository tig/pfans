I have had some minor troubles with mine - smog pump, steering rack and
window switches burning out too quickly.  I do my own repairs, so I'm not
poor for paying mechanics.

I have forwarded this mail to a listing of over 1100 Porsche 928 owners.
You should get more responses than you can stand.

I encourage you to join the mailing list.  You will surely learn a lot.  =
In
between the silly nonsense, we have quite a bit of knowledge about the ca=
rs.

Good luck.
