  Your brakes are set up on a diagonal circuit for safety reasons.  If there
  was a brake failure at one wheel, the diagonal circuit would continue to allow
  some front and rear braking.  From your description, it sounds like the
  master cylinder may be on the way out (or already is).

  Probably no need to worry about these.  Chances are you were looking at 
  the slots that were deliberately cut into the rotors to dissipate gas.  
  I think there are five of them on each front rotor.
