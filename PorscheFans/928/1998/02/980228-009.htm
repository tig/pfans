I've been following this thread for a while.  I changed to BG Products
15-40 synthetic in my '78 a couple of years ago and have had no problem. 
At the same time, I also had their synthetic transmission lube put in.  It
shifts much better, especially the first to second shift.  Absolutely no
leaks anywhere.  In fact, the only leaks on the entire car are from the
rebuilt steering rack.  Bummer, huh?  BTY, anyone have info on removing and
reinstalling CIS fuel injectors?  I was told that they just pull out, but
there must be a tool for it.  Any help is appreciated.  TIA.
Dave Nicholson.
