Hello everyone, I recieved my newly recovered front seats, recovered by Steve
Waters ( http://www.bzz.com/porsche/ ) , in San Diego and they look great. I
sent out the old worn tan seats and had them recovered in black. They're in
the car and I'll take some pictures and put them on the website along with the
newly restored interior. I am just waiting on my center consoule and just sent
the rear seats to Steve to get recovered. 

As for the odometer problem, I got a new one with the 170 mph
speedometer/odometer that has been rebuilt so I didn't have the same problem
agian. I like the different look better then the 160 mph inst. with the metric
below. Looks like I have the low miles award now though.... 00000000 miles on
the odometer!  I haven't matched the milage of the previous odometer.

thanks for the help on the odometer, it was those little tooth gears that wore
out. Too many tooth gears, belts etc on the 928!
