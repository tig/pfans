The subject of "Mystery Blower Syndrome" came up on the list recently,
with a comment that there still wasn't a good answer for the mystery. A
brief recap, as I understand it, is that some cars have a heater blower
that periodically and briefly goes from slow speed to full speed for no
apparent reason.

The fan speed is controlled by selectively switching resistors into the
circuit. The resistors convert electricity into heat instead of rotary
motion.

Looking at the wiring diagrams, I noticed that the heater blower
resistor pack includes a thermal protective switch, which is set up to
bypass the resistor pack when the internal temperature of the pack
exceeds preset limits. This eliminates current flow through the
resistors, and therefore eliminates the heat. When the thermal switch
cools down, it drops out of the circuit, forcing the current flow
through the resistors, slowing the blower.

As to why some blowers speed up and some don't, my guess is that a) some
blowers pull more current than others due to tighter bearings, etc.,
creating more heat; or, b) some thermal switches are more sensitive than
others.

Possible repair could thus include freeing up or lubing the bearings, or
replacing the thermal switch. Has anyone opened the resistor pack?
