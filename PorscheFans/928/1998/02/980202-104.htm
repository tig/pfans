     I have done the RDK bypass procedure to my 91 GT as Phil Tong had 
     described in a previous post. I soldered a jumper wire from pin 2 
     (data line to instrument cluster) to pin 13 (ground) inside the RDK 
     control box. My guess is that this probably just tells the dash 
     display not to respond to the control box output (by grounding the 
     output signal). Now I DO NOT get the RED "TIREPRESSURE LOSS" warning 
     on the digital computer readout everytime I drive the car!
     
     I do have another question. I still get the RED warning light that the 
     RDK system has recorded an error. This light in the instrument cluster 
     (looks like an icon of 2 axles and 4 wheels) comes on and stays on. 
     The Workshop Manual states that during MY 91 the RDK was updated to 
     record the last 8 events in memory for troubleshooting purposes. I 
     have only driven the car twice since the mod (winter weather) so I'm 
     hoping the memory will clear itself after 8 drives. If the RDK is 
     still actually recording faults, then I guess I'll just have to live 
     with the little Red warning light. At least now I don't have to clear 
     the digital dash readout every time I start my drive and every 15 
     minutes thereafter. Hmmm--that was a handy (but usually annoying) 
     consistant reminder of time traveled.
     
     Phil, does your car display the red dash warning light? I assume you 
     have the pre-91 RDK system.
