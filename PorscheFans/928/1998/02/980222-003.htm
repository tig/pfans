<FONT SIZE=3D"1"><TT>=00Dear &quot;Land Shark&quot; tamers:<BR>
    I've been reading the various topics, but have not felt a need to repon=
d<BR>
as there are so many of you out there that know your 928s better than I kno=
w<BR>
mine, and your are responding in a timely manner. So let me fill you in on<=
BR>
some late breaking news instead.<BR>
    I saw a 6.5 Liter 928 engine set up on a Dyno ready for testing. It is<=
BR>
expected to exceed 650 HP without a blower, turbo or nitrous. The intake an=
d<BR>
exhaust manifolds are such works of art that they look like they belong in =
a<BR>
museum. The GTS that all this is going back into will FLY!  I can't say any=
<BR>
more as the &quot;shop&quot; has plans on releasing the official results of=
 their<BR>
tests in articles and in their ads.<BR>
    The plans for &quot;928 Frenzy Zwei&quot; are well under way. Be lookin=
g for more<BR>
information as the scheduled date (9/26/98) appoaches. Keep in mind, this<B=
R>
year the technical event will be followed by a Concours and Autocross on th=
e<BR>
next day. The price for the event will be about $20 for PCA members. An<BR>
event &quot;T&quot;shirt and all food/drink are included. The fee will be a=
bout $25<BR>
for non-PCA members and non-registered attendees.  All non-registered<BR>
attendees will not get a &quot;T&quot; shirt.<BR>
    The paper work needed to form a &quot;928 Registry&quot; within PCA has=
 been<BR>
completed and submitted. More information on that will be provided as it<BR=
>
comes in. Stay tuned.<BR>
<BR>
Happy motoring. Ed<BR>
