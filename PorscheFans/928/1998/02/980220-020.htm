>Actually, once the JatoPorsche is carrying the AIM9L all aspect system, it
doesn't matter whether it faces front or rear.  When carried facing rear,
the car is slower. (the drag coefficient is increased by one half the factor
of the tail fin diameter of the missle, times the cosign of the exhaust port
of the missle times pi times the length).  BUT, with the missle facing
rearward, the traffic moves backward soooo fast that you THINK you're going
faster.
>
>When the missle is facing front, the car is faster by .0004 warp, because
the aerodynamics of the missle actually create a boost effect by warbling
the air flow under the belly pan.
>
>Incidentally, should anyone want to install the system this weekend, the
control modules fit into the space normally used by the rear a/c evaporator,
and the weapons status display will plug into the digital dash pod on late
models.  Earlier vaiants will have to replace the radio with the optional
weapons status display.
>
>Some of you may remember that there was a voice prompt kit that was
offered.  Unfortunately, that kit is not longer available.  It featured a
female voice for all commands, but was withdrawn when the manufacturer was
sued on a fit of political correctness.  It seems that a translation
difficulty had resulted in the "FIRE" command being actually changed to:
"Shoot that big thing at me, big boy!"  and the out of court settlement was
reached when the voice module was withdrawn from the market.
