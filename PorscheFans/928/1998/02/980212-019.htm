I found this 928 on the internet (traderonline) and happened to be the second
caller: 86-1/2, red on black (tan carpet), 5-speed, blah, blah.  The "court"
had set the price at low wholesale ($8975).  Hell, for the most part, if it is
in excellent condition, it could easily be brought up to par (maintenance
wise) for under fair market value.  A deposit was sent, along with a camera,
but when the camera returned & photos were developed, a call had to be made
concerning a few  follies the pictures revieled.  I'd been too late, the owner
of the company who's in charge of selling the car was letting a friend of his
from out of town use the car, eventhough I had money down on it (frown).
Needless to say, my car has been permanently reconstructed by an 18 wheeler (I
think the tranny's good...).  

So, my sad search continues for an 86-1/2, red on black (or tan) 5-speed car
in great-to-excellent shape, hopefully with limited slip (option 220), &
possibly without rear a/c.   Thanks in advance for everyone who may see
anything.   No, I have not dyno'd my 951S since my latest mods, it's still
being assembled.  I'm expecting almost 400hp at the wheels and approx. 420tq
at the wheels.
