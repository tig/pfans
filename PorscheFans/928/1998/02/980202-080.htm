Further to Wayne's post, the catalog number of the Solido model is #1525.  I found
a couple of these in a toy-shop here in Auckland just before Christmas and bought
them.  It's the same model as their earlier 928S model, with the wheels changed
and an S4 wing added.   (Look around the lower front of the car and it does look a
little different from an S4.)

I understood that these were run-out stock - Solido are no longer making them.
If this is not the case then, yes, it's a good model to go looking for.

     I attended a train and toy show last Sat. in Charlotte NC. and found a 
     1/43 scale die cast model of a 928 GT.  The manufacture (Solido) did 
     not give the year but I can't tell the difference form my 87 S4.  If 
     anyone is interested here are the details:
     
     Dealer             Robert Kettel
                        Stone Mountain, GA.
                        404.294.6086
     
     Manufacture        SOLIDO SA
                        11 Route de Houdan
                        28260 Oulins/Anet
                        France, Siret 323244921 00017
     
     The car is brown on black interior, only doors open, with display 
     base and cover. I paid $12.
