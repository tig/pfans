Right you are.  I have posted this one before, but got no responses.  The
engine in my ''78 Euro is exceptionally strong, sometimes it feels moreso
than my '81 Euro S.  However, there is no M28 stamp on the front lug.  On
an original engine, it should be M28/01.  The blank lug poses some
questions. 1) replacement engine and Porsche does it this way,  2) some
other special fitment that I have no info on, 3) just a mistake on someon=
es
part.  The car was painted by the PO and all the stickers were removed, s=
o
I don't have a lot of information there.  I would appreciate any factual
info, conjecture, even outright criticism or whatever.  TIA
Dave Nicholson
