Makes sense - they don't want to warrant if you put Bardahl's or
something else weird in there...

The lower compression 4.7's get away with 87 and the manual specify
this.

Hy-yup!  Know it, use it!  Am reminded of another story Marc Thomas told
me during one of their customer engine rebuilds - removing the drain
plugs and nothing came out!  He had to physically 'break' through a
layer of crud & sediment which had effectively sealed the water jackets
tight!  So there's more to all this than meets the eye and I won't even
go into Water Wetters effectiveness on a sludged-up engine!

And PLEASE don't strip your drain plugs...
Phil
