See my www page @
http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kgibble/bmw/Porsche_Home_Alignment.html -
wrote it last year.  Certainly you don't need a lift or pit.  Mine's
really low and it's still easy even without driving it up onto 2x4's. 
Mark DaVia and David Lloyd can tell you a little about paying a shop to
do alignments.  We checked 4 928's one day and the 3 out of 4 done by
independents were WAY, I really mean WAY, out of spec.  No doubt some
independents do it right and many dealers blow it.  However, I know I do
it right - or at least I know my limitations.  In my www procedure, you
get some confidence intervals for the camber so you have a pretty good
idea of your errors.

Best,
