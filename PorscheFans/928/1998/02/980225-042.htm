Phil,
What has always puzzled me (well, not always) is why the 944 Turbo got
standard Dual Airbags in 87 (supposedly first production car ever with dual
airbags), and the 928s didn't get them till 90. Another example of how the
928 was kind of snubbed by Porsche.

P.S. If you look in the Workshop manual it shows how to detonate the airbags
safely from a long way away, looks like a lot of fun.

When can we get together and slide your airbags under some Corvettes, etc.
and have a little blast ;-)
