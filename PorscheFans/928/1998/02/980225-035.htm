I finally had the major service and general checkup that I'd been
putting off. (The first time a professional mechanic has touched my S4
since the pre-sale exam.) Good news is the mechanic said it was one of
the better maintained 928 examples he'd seen. No unpleasant surprises
and no water damage from the flooding I got caught in early in the
month.

Miscellaneous ramblings:

How many list members have actually been warned of an actual problem by
the timing belt warning light. It seems that most of the issues are with
the sensor system itself, rather than the belt. (The PO disconnected the
sensor, and I left it that way.)

Is an upgrade of a non-airbagged S4 to a driver's airbag feasible? Would
it require systems or connections that the car doesn't have? (I believe
I missed the driver's bag as standard by one year) A different steering
wheel? Has anyone done this? I actually received my set of sevice
manuals today - I may be able to find some of these answers myself.

I'm looking at the "Aero" mirrors in the Devek catalog. They come
primed. I'm looking for input on where to find "metallic silver" Porsche
paint.
