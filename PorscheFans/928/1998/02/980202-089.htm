OK, back to basics. When fuel-air mixture is exploded in a cylinder of your
car's engine, it pushes down on the piston, which pushes the connecting
rod, which pushes on the crankshaft, which then turns. That turning motion
is coupled to your car's drive wheels by the transmission and final drive,
so the wheels want to turn. However, the car, like any other body with
mass, has inertia and wants to sit still. The more emphatically the wheels
want to turn, the more quickly the car will change speed.

This emphasis is called "torque", and an easy way to measure torque is by
seeing how much force it translates to at a given radius from the center of
whatever it is that's turning. If you measure the force in pounds and the
radius in feet, you have the common British and US units of pound-feet
(abbreviated "lb-ft").

For example, if you put a stock 1987 928 S4 into first gear and floor the
throttle, you soon arrive at an engine speed at which the engine is
producing its peak torque of 317 lb-ft. The transmission multiplies this by
the first gear ratio of 4.0672, then the final drive multiplies this by its
ratio of 2.20, so the torque supplied to the rear "axle" is 317 x 4.0672 x
2.20 = 2836 lb-ft.

The rolling radius of the rear tires is just under one foot, so, given
adequate traction, those tires apply a force of about 2850 lb to the
pavement, which doesn't shred, but pushes back with the same force. Since
the car and driver weigh around 3700 lb, the result is an acceleration of
about 0.77 g, which is why you feel your cheeks being pulled back.


OK, so torque is a Good Thing. Now, we'd like to keep up this level of
acceleration as long as possible. If the engine stops making torque at 4000
rpm, we'll need to shift to a higher gear, where the overall torque
multiplication will be less, so there will be less torque at the rear
wheels and less force to accelerate the car. However, if the Good Fairy (or
Porsche AG) gives us overhead cams, tuned induction, and all the other
refinements that let the engine keep making that same nice high torque
through, say, 6000 rpm, we'll be able to accelerate hard that much longer,
getting that nice low 0-60 or 1/4 mile time we're looking for.

This translates to power. Horsepower is the product of torque and engine
speed. Compare a truck engine that produces 400 lb-ft at 2500 rpm and a
motorcycle engine that produces 100 lb-ft at 10,000 rpm; however different
these two engines may be, they both produce the same horsepower. Using
non-metric units, horsepower = torque (in lb-ft) times engine speed (in
rpm) divided by 5252, so both examples produce 190 bhp.

All the gears in the car don't affect horsepower (except through losses due
to friction). When we put a car on a chassis dyno, we measure the torque at
the rear wheels (up from engine torque by the cumulative gear ratio), but
multiply it by the speed of the rear axle (down from engine speed by the
same ratio), so multiplying these two numbers gives the same result, losses
aside, as measuring the engine directly.

>how do these numbers relate practically to driving a car?

Spec sheets tend to emphasize peak values of torque and horsepower. In the
real world, it's much more important to be able to get a lot of torque over
a wide range of engine speeds than to get huge torque, but only at a narrow
range of speeds. Both the truck engine and the motorcycle engine are
narrow-band; you need to upshift frequently in the truck because the engine
just won't turn any faster, and you need to keep downshifting to keep the
revs up in the motorcycle, because otherwise it won't make torque.

The Euro 928 S engines are a little like the motorcycle engine, though not
as much as the typical 911 engine. The US engine (and, to a greater degree,
the S4 engine) have broad, fairly flat torque curves, which enable you to
get good acceleration at relatively low engine speed (e.g., 3000 rpm) and
keep up the fun for quite a while (e.g., 6200 rpm).
