The first two terms are fine (1728 cubic inches in one cubic foot, two
crank revolutions to sweep each cylinder in an Otto-cycle engine), but the
last raises an issue. If you're looking to predict flow through the intake,
I'd suggest a factor greater than unity to deal with flow through the
cylinders during the "overlap" when both intake and exhaust valves are
open, and just generally for conservatism in the calculation.

The exhaust flow is another issue, as you've created some new gases during
combustion, and everything is now hot and expanding on its way out of the
cylinder, but then cools and contracts as it travels through the exhaust
plumbing. Remember that dramatic photo in the Porsche ad showing the
glowing headers?

Which muffler setup? Remember also that S4, GT, and GTS engines count on
some restriction in the exhaust plumbing as part of the tuning responsible
for propping up the low-rpm part of the torque curve. The fancy new Ferrari
550 has a variable resistance (goes away at high rpms) built into its
exhaust system to do this a little more effectively.
