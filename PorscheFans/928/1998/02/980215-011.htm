Larry,

Sounds like the problem with your car is the idle adjuster. This sounds
like the type of symptoms it can produces when it fails.  It regulates
the amount of air that bypasses the throttle valve.  I took apart my old
one and it was absolutely worn out, deep gouges on the commutator and
the points were gone.=20

It is located under the intake manifold, on the passenger side near the
rear of the engine.  By guess would be that any of these idle
stabilizers/regulators with over 100,000 mi of use is probably going
bad.
You may be able to get to this by just pulling out the air cleaner box,
but when I tried this EVERYTHING I touched broke.  Don=92t let this scare
you, just be prepared for 12+ years of engine heat trapped under the
manifolds.  Like brittle vacuum lines and hoses and the sheathing on the
wiring harness was cracking.  There are 3 little rubber cushioned
mounting bolts that hold the throttle body/air guide housing in place
that were also brittle and broke.  Not to mention any O-rings you might
encounter. =20
I ended up removing my fuel injection rails, front 2 intake manifold
pieces and throttle body. Its all back together and running good.
For good parts source, Susan Kirby at Devek (650)-592-5287 was
informative, helpful and more knowledgeable than anyone else I called.=20
If your going to dig in there, plan on replacing any hoses that have not
already been replaced.  About $200 worth of hoses and $120 for the Idle
regulator.  (I've called the part several different names because it
seems to have several names!) =20

I got a new Idle speed regulator from a local Bosch dealer shipped in
from CA.  According to my book the part is the same for '85 and '86's=20
Bosch part 0280.140.509 for $113 plus tax.

I replaced mine to fix a cold start problem, will test this out tomorrow
morning, just put it back together.  :o) On the road again after 2 weeks
of down time.=20

Hope this help,
Ken Postma '86 928S auto
