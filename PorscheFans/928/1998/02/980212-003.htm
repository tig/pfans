Yes you are right, normal force is that which is perpendicular to the
friction surface.  So the case of a banked turn, there is more than just
gravity aiding normal force... the acceleration of the vehicle "up" (from
the driver's point of view) augments the normal force and thus the
cornering g's through the turn.  The assumption you stated that my
calculation about the aerodynamic downforce would only apply to surfaces
that are flat it correct.

Thanks for the info about the 3-5 g figures with "unaided surface angle"
;-)  Amazing, isn't it?  It is the same with the case of the dragster you
mention...  Although I would assert that off the line, while velocity is
zero, the instantaneous acceleration in the dragster cannot be (much)
greater than 1g and it achieves the >1g acceleration only through the aid
of aerodynamic downforce.  (I use the word "much" because I'm not sure if a
sticky drag-tire could have an effective coefficient of friction > 1 and
also because I am unsure the effect of the "growing-diameter tire" at the
time of launch isn't significant to accelerate the car upwards and thus
momentarily achieve normal force greater than the weight of the dragster)
