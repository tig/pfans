Dear Friends:

The other day, when I was at a local tire store having my wheels
balanced, the mechanic called me over and asked me to hold one of the
wheel lugs in my hand.  Well, to my surprise they are as light as a
feather....they feel like plastic.  The guy said these are made out of
Titanium steel.  I thought this was too much....

The other thing that I found out was that the little light under the
hood is actually switched on by an internal glob of mercury that runs up
and down a glass tube, called a "mercury switch".  I looked the longest
trying to find where the off switch was located for the hood light. 
Leave it to the Germans!!

Here's a hint if you are having problems with any switches or lights..go
out and buy a little test light with a sharp pointed pick at one end. 
This pick is to allow you to stick into wires at any interval in the
wire to check the current flow.  That way you can tell at what point you
are not getting current and pin point the problem easier.

Yours

Mark
