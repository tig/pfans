John et. al,
I should have forseen that my comment may have rubbed some people the
wrong way.  Rest assured that I am not judging anyone based on their
income or how big their house is.  My comment was based on my experience
and not on prejudice.  What I meant in my letter is that some model year
928's have fallen in price to the point that a lot more people can
afford them.  Unfortunately this often leads to people who can afford to
buy a $12,000 car but can't afford the upkeep and maintenance costs of
the $12,000 928, which leads to a lot of poorly maintained vehicles on
the market.  Ever seen someone driving a Corvette that has tires on it
that you can buy at Wal-Mart?  I'm not saying that John or anyone else
on this list is trying to be something that they aren't or act like they
have money when they don't, I'm just saying that it does happen.  I've
seen the cars.  And by the way John, I have never even considered your
age when I have read your posts or thought about what and who a 928
owner should be.  I am fairly young myself (24), and I think that
maturity speaks volumes of chronological numbers.  Enjoy your 928, keep
it maintained to the best of your ability and please don't be insulted!
Regards,
Brian Buxton

P.S.  Thanks for being so civil in your reply!
