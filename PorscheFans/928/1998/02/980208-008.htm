Not long ago someone desribed a problem with speed variation while using
cruise control. The likely cause was identified as a vacuum line. My
mechanical capability should allow me to check/replace a vacuum line if I
could find it. (Rarely do I read of a problem I would consider tackling on
this car, which I have had for only six months.) Where is the cruise control
line(s). And more importantly, do I stand a chance of reaching it without a
major dismantling effort. Thank you in advance for any advice offered.

One more question. My mechanic identified a cooling system gasket leak (water
inlet on engine). We agreed to put the work off until Spring because the job
will take a few hours and the leak is minimal. He said failure of this part is
not uncommon. My question is this: what other work falls into the "might as
well while I'm there" category? Would I be half way to a belt replacement job
based on removal of interferences, or am I making too big a deal out of this
gasket job? Thanks again for your thoughts.
