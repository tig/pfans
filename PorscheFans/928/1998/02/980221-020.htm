Oh, Moira, Moira, Moira!  No, No, No.  You MUST walk the walk and talk the talk.
I mean, "dicks" REALLY.  There are much more well....even, politically
correct terms. Even romantic terms. 

Dick makes one think of dick-HEAD, which aptly describes the idiot
from...where was it...Oregon? who was quoted in the Times with disparaging
comments about the 928. Well, that sort of says it, doesn't it?  And he was
an official at one of the regions of PCA!  Should be relieved of
his....Porsche, that is.

It sort of made me want to give up my PCA membership.  Afterall, now ALL
Porsches are water cooled, aren't they?  I am afraid that PCA is becoming
more and more crowded with the car wannabe types that, now that they CAN
afford one, they buy a Porsche.  Although they don't know why, so they buy a
911.  In the vain hope that such an experience will fill out....at least ONE
side of their personalities.

It's ok, Moira, that you have a 911.  Afterall, you hang out or at least
lurk about, with those of us who were chosen to have a 928!  Keep looking,
kid.  You'll find one yet.  In fact, I'll start looking for you, too.

Can't let a good guy get away, even if you are female!  By the way, are you
a blonde?
