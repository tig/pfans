I was driving through Roslindale, MASS (near Boston) at around 1 am
Saturday night (rather Sunday morning) and noticed an absolutely beautiful
pearl yellow S4 parked on the side of the read. I slammed on the brakes and
checked it out. I then rounded up two other fellow 928 enthusiast friends
(from their sleep) and returned to take a closer look. Although it was
nightime, the paintwork looked absolutely superb. The interior was
something else. It was completely recovered in two-tone black and yellow,
with yellow stitching in the seats. The interior looked absolutely showroom
new.

So, does anyone on this list own this car?
