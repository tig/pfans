re: 1st gear shift points	

This used to drive me nuts also.  

Road test reports on the early 3-speed a/t indicated the gears held all
the way to redline (and gearing most perfectly spaced for the 4.5 engine
tune).

Later reports on the 4-speed S a/t complained about early up-shifting
from 1st no matter the selector position and I found that to be true on
my old '84.  A fluid change moved the shift point up but not to 6k
redline.  Maybe it was old fluid, maybe it was just too low, maybe
something was sticking in the transaxle or valve body?   Also there were
many posts on porschefans with other 4-speed a/t owners on either side
of the camp - 'mine holds to redline' or 'arrghh it doesn't on mine
neither'.

Interesting, no?  I am recalling an earlier post about how Porsche
programmed one of the chips to allow for 'reduced torque shifting' to
protect tranny internals and wondering if this is what was meant (an
early 1-2 shift)?

A good MB trans shop should be able to handle our a/t's since... they're
MB internals!  Also, Devek has plans on engineering an a/t shift kit but
I don't know any more details.  (I did bug Susan and Marc about it
enough last year though!)  Anyhows, I (too) see the performance value if
the trans would hold 1st to redline - would probably knock at least .25
seconds off the 1/4 mile time for sure and make those stoplight to
stoplight contests a bit more interesting.

At least we have Patrick's cool remote kick-down mod!

Looking forward to other replies / survey results.
Phil Tong
