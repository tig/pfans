As everyone here has been very helpful with knowledge regarding my 
928, I am doing this public service for the list.

If anyone wants to know how to turn off MIME in their e-mail package, 
E-Mail me and I will reply with step by step instructions.
I have experience with all commercial e-mail packages on several 
different platforms, and in fact I have several installed on this PC.

Unless I get deluged with requests I should be able to reply to you 
privately within several hours. So please just write to me with the 
name of your software and version (Go to the help menu and choose 
'about' or its equivalent, or watch carefully when you start up your 
e-mail program and the version number will be on the 'splash screen' 
which will tell you about the author and the name of the software as 
well as the version number)

You may send your correspondences regarding this matter to 
jhall@adnc.com or root@merdan.com. Whichever you find easier to 
type.
