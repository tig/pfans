Andy,
Thanks for the clarification,  I understand. I made the original post to
clarify differences between an 87' and an 89', and some thought that the trans
gear spacing  was the same, with only the final drive ratio being different.
Hence my post to further clarify what I'd read. That's why I capped the "and"
part.....(see above)
Sorry for the confusion.
Is it Christmas in New Zealand?
