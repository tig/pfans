I called Moffits in search of this Model(928gts) before I could even ask
about the model, he said he didn't have it and they (the manufacturer)
were not going to make it.   He also asked me if I would be kind 
enough to post that on this list.  Apparently he has received more
calls than he wants regarding this Item.

What effect would having the flaps that are in front of the radiator
on a 1987s4 permanently open? I understand that they are supposed to
open and close by themselves. Correct me if I am wrong.

Are these cars prone to a constant ticking that seems to be coming
from the intake? I have heard this noise on a low mile 93gts and
on a s4 with 80k on the odometer as well as my own car.
Is this the cam followers that are making this noise?
