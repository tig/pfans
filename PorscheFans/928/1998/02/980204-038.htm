>>Why do we need to flush and change brake fluid to save the calipers?  

I might be wrong, but I'm thinking rust...brake fluid eventually absorbs

moisture.

Stand in front of the car, holding three candles and an urn of eye
of newt, and shout, "SILENCE, DAMMIT".  Well, this approach
works as well as anything else on Magic Blower Syndrome...

You're egg-free, old boy.  Whether or not you're nuts is a separate 
issue.

Gas additives generally are there to remove varnish and sludge
from various parts.  Key parts here are:

1. injectors
2. back of intake valves (buildup here badly messes up the flow
into the cylinders)

You'll notice improved performance with these types of additives
when you use them after NOT using them for a long time.  This
is because you're eliminating the accumulated buildup.

Of course, Red Line makes a product to do this (y'all knew this
was coming, didn't ya?) called SI-2.  They also make SI-1, which
is the same chemical, but different packaging.

Additives (detergents) in gasolines that you hear the gas companies
advertise are generally good at cleaning the injectors, but they tend
to CAUSE the buildup on the backs of the valves.

It seems to me that I asked Roy Howell at Red Line about Techron
once, and he thought it was once of the best of the mass-market
additives.

Red Line's product is about $2 a bottle.  I add a bottle to my tank
about every 5 or 10 fills.  It will remove the buildup from the backs
of the intake valves as well as clean the injectors.  BMW has a
part number for this Red Line product.
