Yes, this is the perfect size for the rear tires and is very happy on 9.5"
wheels (Michelin recommends anything from 8.5" to 10"; GTS stock is 9").

>Should I buy 265/35 17 to get the same gear ratio?

No, for two reasons. First, I don't think anyone makes a tire in this size
(you may be thinking of 265/35x18, which would require a different wheel).
Second, even if it existed, a tire this size would be smaller in rolling
radius than the 255/40x17 and would lower the car and shorten the gearing.

>I saw a small cable that was going along with the coax cable, what is that?

If your car has its radio antenna in the windshield glass (or if you have
the short whip antenna mounted on the roof), there is a preamplifier for
the radio signal, and this needs DC power to operate.
