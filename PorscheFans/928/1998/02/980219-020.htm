  Easy for '90 and '91: 5-speeds are GTs and autos are S4s.  '89 was the
  crossover year where there were both 5-speed S4s and GTs.

  The VIN won't tell you.  In '89, shocks were whatever was standard issue
  unless the optional sport shocks were ordered, so the color doesn't
  necessarily provide the answer.  I'm pretty sure the same applied with
  the shocks in '90 & '91.
  
  If the exhaust is factory issue, the GT has two pipes at the rear versus
  the single oval pipe of the S4 (which I understand is just a large
  oval cover that fits over two pipes coming out of the muffler).
  
  The GT would have sport seats as standard issue as well as a shorted
  shift lever.

  Other owners have also noticed that their GT doesn't list any specific
  "GT" option.
