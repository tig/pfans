This is so polite.  I was tempted to say "bollocks" again.

I agree entirely with Andrew on this.  A close ratio 'box is precisely
that - a gearbox with comapratively small differences between the gear
ratios.  Such a 'box will often be mated with a shorter (numerically
higher) final drive to make up for the taller first gear.
