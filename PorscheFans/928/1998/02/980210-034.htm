When I was in Auckland in '87, I was astounded to see a fund raising raffle
offering as first prize *your choice* of a three bedroom suburban house or
a 924S.

You're right, the price discussions are of interest--especially when they
involve a place as desireble to live in as N Zed.

Tell me, are the duties on imported used cars still as extreme as they once
were? I was looking at a basket case Healey 3000 10 years ago, and was
outbid ($2,500) by a Kiwi who explained that if he brought the car in in
pieces and paid for a professional restoration ($25,000 in local money)
he'd still be ahead...
and this car was LHD(!) He said duties on a used complete car were 100%,
but duties on parts was more like 30%. Is/was that true? (BTW, NZed dollars
were .76 USD at the time, I think)
