Some responses to various posts.

Leonard. That Ticking is normal. Its pretty common. All 8 injectors fire 
at the same time so they are rather more audible than you would expect 
from a sequential system.

Stephane. A hall effect sensor is a device that can detect a magnetic 
field. Usually used in automotive applications to detect engine timing 
things such as TDC or in modern distributors instead of points. Can also 
be used for other stuff like detecting current flow without breaking the 
circuit to do so.

Joe. Check your windshield for a leak. I have this problem but I'm 
waiting for warmer weather to fix it. If you have a leak along the top it 
can collect in the headliner area. In my case it sits up there until I 
Brake at which time it (laws of motion being what they are) it wants to 
keep going and spills over the top of the headliner trim and falls onto 
me. The spot it always seems to find is one that requires an immediate 
explanation as I walk into the office.
