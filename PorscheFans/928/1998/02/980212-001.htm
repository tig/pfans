I have never seen a drag car with IRS... Most cars with independent rear
susupension dont have enough power, or a manual transmission, so you will
never experience this.  I have a 5 speed Thunderbird super coupe also, and
with it's IRS, it has pretty bad wheel hop, as well. I know that my 85 928 5
speed that had LSD had violent wheel hop ( axle tramp, or whatever you want to
call it ) but it is not as much of a problem on my 79 or 81 euro S, which only
spin the RR tire.  And the rear shocks are wasted on my 81 right now.  The new
ones have been quietly sitting on a shelf waiting for me to get off my lazy
@$$ and do them.  Just my .02....

>>>essentially making it a female. For some reason it's pissed off every
day now, begs to be fed and doesn't sleep with me anymore. Hmmm.

Isnt this typical of ALL females?  Both my wives have been exactly like
this----thought it was normal?
