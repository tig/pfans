	Vince,

		The sensor we are talking about is an original Bosch sensor, not a no
	name brand spin off.  I would like to know if there is really a
	difference
	between the typical 3 wire Bosch sensor and the one with a Porsche label
	on it (or just the one with the Porsche connector).

Is there a difference between a Bosch or a Porsche O2 sensor?  I think not.  I have yet to
change the O2 sensor on my '83 S. (over 200K miles with the original O2 sensor..)  So I
cannot say for sure.  But I can tell you that on my wife's Volvo, it does use a Bosch and
it cost $246 for an exact replacement at PepBoys.  I can imagine how much the Volvo dealer
want for it.  I just decided to cross-ref it with another vehicle that uses the same Bosch
part number for less than half the cost.  I snipped the connector and splice it into the
original harness.  All is well.

Before I did that, I experimented a little... I have a brand new sensor from a '86 Ford
Ranger pickup.  Just out of curiosity, I did some testing between it and the Bosch.  They
are both a 3-wire sensor and the thread size is the same.  Both gives out the same range
of voltages; 0.1 to 1.0.  The differences is that the response time on the Ford sensor is
much slower compared to the Bosch.  About 3 times slower.  And the heater is about twice
the resistance, therefore the operating temperature will be different.  I used a propane
torch to do the testing.  You don't want to heat it up too much or you'll vaporize the
zirconium substrate.  I was all worked up at this point so I decided to install the Ford
sensor onto the Volvo.  It ran like crap.  The idle rpm flunctuated between 1k to 1.5k
every 10 seconds.  I concluded that this is due to the slower response time on the Ford
sensor.  Satisfied with my experiment, I replaced the sensor again with a new Bosch.  It
ran just fine.  Not exactly an experiment that follows all the correct scientific
protocols but one that satisfies me enough to conclude that not all O2 sensors are created
equally.
