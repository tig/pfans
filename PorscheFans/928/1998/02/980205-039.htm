	HI, just gotta get another .02 worth in on some debates.

	Stephane, the coolent system pressure is controlled by the radiator cap. 
 With the motor cold you can compress the hoses and hear the fluid move, 
with it hot there will be press, how much should depend on how hot the 
coolent is.  If the coolent gets to hot, to much pressure the cap will 
vent.  There is supposed to be some air in the system, catch tank. If you 
were to completly fill the catch tank the fluid will expand and your 
shark will spit up some fluid.  When it cools the coolent will contract 
and it will suck air into the tank.  You may have to much fluid and a 
stuck cap, to much pressure will be hard on the hoses.

	The study on exhaust flow based on air intake is interesting, but full 
of error.  Basically everybody is on the right track, but it would be 
very tricky to get very accurate.  First problem is on the intake side, 
volumetric effiecincy, it won't be 1, all normally assperated engines 
(not super charged) will draw in less than there displacement.  If every 
thing is just right you can get 1 or just above 1 over a very small RPM 
range.  Tuned intake runners will have opperating peaks thru out the RPM 
range of the engine, the cam will also have a peak RPM band.  A normal 
street engine won't hit volumetric eff of 1 any where in its operating 
range.  So what is the vol eff ? and what is it at the RPM range that you 
want the data? Second problem the exhaust gets very hot then cools, this 
would be very tricky to model, even if there were not a chemical reaction 
to further complicate matters.  Back in college I took a heat transfer 
class, did alot of calculations, complex stuff.  One day we asked the 
instructer how much error is in this stuff, about 30%.  Some things are 
best realted to past experience and experiments.  Would it be possible to 
measure the flow rate, but that would change as the exhaust is cooling, 
so it would matter where you measured it at.  Do we all have a copy of 
"The design and tuning of competion engines" Robert Bentley?  Great book, 
explains why it works!

	Aerodynamics and mass are related and they are not...  In a straight 
line they are related, both help with traction.  But around a curve the 
mass is trying to make the car go straight and the aerodynamics is trying 
to hold the car down, improving traction.  Note this is the ideal 
situation, the aerodynamics can also cause more harm than good.  The 
front end can lift at high speed, that would be bad aerodynamics!

	TED HEINRITZ	By the way, the inside of a decommisioned ship is like a 
ice cube, what a cold misearble day!
