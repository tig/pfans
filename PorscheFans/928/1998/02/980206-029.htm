Louis Ott asked:

Louis, 
the technical specifications manual gives the following:

         Tires                         Wheel
front   225/50                     7J x 16H2   65mm offset
rear    245/45                     8J x 16H2   52.3mm offset

The club sport and GT were fitted with:

front  225/50                      8J x 16H2  60mm
rear   245/45                      9J x 16H2  60mm offset w/ 17mm spacer

Hope this helps,

David Schultz
'87 S4 5spd nearly out of bad gas
