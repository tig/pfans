Hi Steve!!!!  
<Sending to 928 list because no return address on your mail!>

Yes, driving from Sacto is a long way to Monterey and you can be sure
traffic will be heavy once you get close to Monterey no matter what
time.  I could not find a hotel that would allow a single night stay,
they all wanted minimum 3-night reservation!!!  So I will be driving
down and returning the same day/night.  FWIW you might try to find a
place in Santa Cruz but do it now.  Or San Jose / San Francisco / any of
the Motel 6 etc. along 101 by SF airport, although you might be tempted
to continue going?  It would be better to rest.  We could convoy to the
city if the same day travel.  I'm trying to get Jim Murphy to convoy
also.

Are you still on the 928 list?  Lots of email to read everyday so can
get too busy!  Oh yeah, another event soon is NASA driving school at
Sears Point March 14, I am going and same with Jim (hope so).  For sure
Mark Kibort there with his '84 928 S.

Let's hear it for the E-class!  Sure to be fun this year!
Phil
