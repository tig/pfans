The next question on door locks, someone had posted that all he did was
swap the passenger with the driver side lock, no fix but acceptable. The
next post IM responding to was the driver side locks with factory alarms
are different from the passenger side. My question my factory alarm has
been disabled, can I still swap out he locks, knowing that the alarm
will not work?

Several days ago I posted that I had switched the locks on my '85.  It had a
factory alarm that worked before and after the switch.  Apparently someone
has read somewhere that this can't be done.  I did it, you can't argue with
success!

BTW, how are those manuals working?
