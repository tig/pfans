You're right, it has no timing belt light. Indicators are mileage,
and probably age as well. Fortunately, assuming your engine
hasn't been tinkered with, the valves and pistons won't meet
if the belt should fail. Although it's apparently a very
close thing, so if a little bit had been shaved off the head
by some Previous Owner the expected clearance might not be
there.

One other possible indicator is hearing the belt flapping
against the housing (my personal experience). A definite
indication that it's time to make the change.
