Gee, i've sure read a lot to comment about.

I bet we've talked about this before, but I dont recall the results 
if we have.
What is the choice octane to put into your vehicle?

My father is steadfast in the belief that you wont see one iota of 
performance gain by running higher octane fuel than your engine was 
designed for. Is that true? I prefer to use mid-grade 89 and 91 gas 
in my 928. (I also prefer to use Texaco gas) I honestly haven't 
driven it enough to be able to tell the difference, but I like to 
think that its happier with the mid stuff, since most of my other 
cars were/are.

Mine is a bone stock 78' - Anyone know what octane those fine German 
engineers think I should put in my tank?
