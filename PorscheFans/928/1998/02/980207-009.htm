Specifically, it was my '83 928S, the spring used to engage the reverse 
gear lockout. Reverse gears changed for '85 (along with lots of other 
things) so maybe, maybe not, this applies to you.

Not having the P/N handy, the part I'm thinking of is shown on page 
34-19 of the service manual (volume II). Its item 5, described as "leaf 
spring." You can see the tab in the picture. Mine broke off. The part 
is smaller than a business card, flat. Was about $3 or $4. But the 
whole transmission has to come out to get to it. Once out, its only the 
top cover that has to be removed. It bolts to the top cover.

Actually, mine was replaced in a complete transmission job. Had to have 
new reverse gears too, as the original were in sad shape. Filings from 
the reverse gears also caused me to replace the pinion bearing ($560). 
Also had a scored shifter fork that was replaced. And syncros...
