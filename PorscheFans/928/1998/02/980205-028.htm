>>Ed Thanks for that bit of info. I thought for sure my 86S had been mis-wired
>>(my passenger side power window selector is set to go up on the down
>>button). I kept wondering why my turn signal light stays on.
>>One time I had to fly from Burbank Airport to San Francisco to work on a
>>clients system. I left the car parked in extended parking for a week. It
>>seems I left the indicator light (turn signal) engaged. When I got back
>>VIOLA! dead battery. I got a jump from the parking attendant. I find this
>>feature annoying. I have to constantly check my car to see that the signal
>>is shutoff. (my 86S does not automatically disengage the turn signal all the
>>time, due to wear, so this creates a problem) I have left the signal on for
>>8 or more hours and have not had battery problem.
>>
On my car at least, when I open the door with the turn signal on and
the ignition off, the chime sounds - same chime that sounds when I
leave the lights on. Might be worthwhile to check why yours doesn't
work. Killing your battery can get expensive pretty quickly.
