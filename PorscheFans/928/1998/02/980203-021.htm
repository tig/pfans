Hi,

I'm sure there will be a dozen answers, but here's my attempt to make it
somewhat intuitive:

Torque is essentially "twist", it is force applied such that if the
object being pushed on moved, it would move circularly. As an example,
imagine bolting a ten foot bar across each rear wheel of a 928 and
hanging a 15 lb weight on the end of each while holding the brakes on.
There is a total 300 ft. lbs. torque applied, but nothing is happening
(maybe some bending, but it doesn't change). Notably the brakes don't
get hot because there isn't any energy being expended. You could leave
this sitting for months with no changes.

However, note that the object doesn't have to move! Now consider a 928
motor, full throttle open. The force of the burning mixture pushing down
on the crank throws is a LOT over 30 lbs., but it is acting over just a
few inches (the crank throw length) and all this results in the same 300
ft lbs. of torque. However, unlike the first example, the 928 crankshaft
is turning! Something is certainly changing at this point, namely the
car is accelerating which is due to the engine pumping energy into the
car which is being transformed into 3400 lbs. of steel, aluminum, etc.
moving, which is a form of energy - kinetic energy.

Now when you bring the car to a stop, notice that the brakes are hot -
be careful, they can get VERY hot. This heat is were the energy of the
moving car went, it was changed from kinetic energy into heat energy
which raised the temperature of the brakes, and eventually they heat up
the air.

All this is to illustrate the difference of torque, power and energy.

Torque is a force, a twist, but not moving. It is sort of the potential
to produce energy, but until it moves, nothing happens. You can lean on
a car without getting tired, but if you actually accelerate it, you'll
feel tired after a while.

Power is essentially the rate that force is being turned into energy. If
you accelerate your 928 at 3000 rpm to 60 you will get there slower than
if you are at 5500 rpm, yet the torque is about the same. This is
because the rate the torque is applied is lower (3000 rpm Vs 5500 rpm)
therefore the power is less by the same factor.

Energy is sort of an absolute amount. A car moving 60 mph has a certain
amount of kinetic energy which is just it's weight times the square of
it's velocity. Whether it got there 0-60 in 5 sec or 50, the energy is
the same, and it doesn't go away. For our purposes, it starts as
chemical energy in the gas, is changed into heat energy in combustion,
is changed into kinetic energy by the pistons,  dumped into the velocity
of the car still as kinetic energy, some goes off mainly as heat to the
air resistance and to the wheel bearings, the rest is turned into heat
by the brakes. Eventually that heat is radiated off into space and goes
out forever (really).
