I put in a pump from Vertex and it is working fine.  It was not the
best possible job (the cleaning ot the original part was not as
good as I would expect, and the bearing could have been a bit
thighter).  But it was good enough to put in my car.

The other problem was with the refund for the core.  I got my
money back when I told them I needed to buy a master brake
cylinder but would not buy it until my account was credited.  They
responded that my account was credited the day before...

Ideally, you should be able to look at the pump and say if it
was rebuilt properly.  If it does not meet your standard, return it
until they have it right.
