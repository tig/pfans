 Dear Fellow Sharkers

    As most of you know, speedo function is kind of
sporadic.  I am learning to rely on my tach for staying
reasonable "within" the speed limit (+15mph).  I have
found that just under 2k rpm in 5th gear equates to
about 60mph.  Does anyone have any input to other
gears?  I shift from 3rd to 4th at about 3k rpm and the
same from 4th to 5th.  My 83S is just too much fun to
drive to put it into the shop to have fixed.  This is
something I can live with for a while.

Thanks.  Happy (and safe) motoring,
Tom LoCascio
