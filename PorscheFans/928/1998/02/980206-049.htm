Bzzzzt!  Close, but no cigar.

Kevin,  I don't know where you got that info from, but there is a little more to it
than that.

The Club Sport was lightened a lot from the S4 and had the wider rear track
and stiffer suspension.  It still had standard S4 spec as far as the rest of the
mechanicals were concerned, but it missed out on a lot of the luxury items. It
didn't sell well in Britain, so they did a little market research and discovered
people wanted the luxury items.

The SE was a result of that research.  They put the electric seats and climate
control and all that back into the CS, then compensated by adding different
engine management, cam profiles and exhaust and by making the suspension
a bit firmer, all to make up for the extra weight.  Delightfully, they seemed to
over compensate and the SE was capable of better acceleration and higher top
speed than either the CS or the subsequent GT.

There are a myriad of little differences.  For example, last year someone dropped
a sledgehammer on the road and I ran over it in the SE.  It smashed an aircond
pipe, a lower one that goes around the exhaust somewhere.  (I don't do my own
service.)  The workshop ordered one for an S4/CS, that didn't fit.  They tried a
GT one, and that didn't fit.  The pipe to go on the SE was a pure SE part and
so we had to wait for it to come from Germany.  It was $100 (yes!) MORE than
the S4 or GT part.

928 Performance Portfolio has a bit about it.  I also have a copy of a 1988 AutoCar
article about it.  It was hard to get anything definitive, though.
