Ed, and Stephane,
Well, now you've really done it.  I am deeply disturbed by your posts. 
I think my personal rights have been violated, and I am going to be in
contact with the nearest government agency to see what can be done about
the likes of you both.  You are both trampling all over a few of my
rights, some of which are the right to free speech, public debate, and
the right to read a bunch of worthless personal insults on the
Internet.  After my stint in the Southern IN psychiatric hospital I will
be knocking on both your doors with either:
1. a supoena to court for the lawsuit of  the mental anguish and verbal
constipation caused by you both, OR

2. an inviatation to meet somewhere in our 928's, drink beer and smoke
cigars

Please make your preferred choice and contact my lawyer as soon as
possible.

Regards,
Brian Buxton
