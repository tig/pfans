Hi everyone

I have to put in my O2 worth (pun intended) on oxygen sensors. Also known 
as Lambda sensors. First, there are two types of sensors used for 
automotive applications. They're generally referred to as titania and 
zirconia (zirconium dioxide). Zirconia is far more common and is the type 
we care about. The titania is a variable resistance type of device where 
as the zirconia generates volts and that's the key. If the output is 
measured at around half or volt its almost certainly working. The output 
voltage will vary with the oxygen content of the exhaust, not rpm. 
Because the computer continuously adjusts the injection to maintain a 
specific oxygen content in the exhaust, a signal of about half a volt 
that doesn't change is actually a pretty good indicator that things are 
working as they should. Both types need to be at 300 Celsius or so before 
they work and typical operating temperatures are about double that. 
That's why later cars have heaters. Not because they're further down the 
exhaust stream but to get them up to temperature quicker for reduced 
emissions earlier in the cycle. The output of the sensor actually cycles 
up and down by about half a volt or so around twice a second when 
operating normally but this is impossible to measure without a scope. The 
cycle speed is determined by a number of things with the response time of 
the sensor being a pretty small part. They're actually quite fast. So, 
how to correctly test the sensor. Use propane. The engine must be warmed 
up first so we know the sensor is good and hot then we need to feed a 
fairly large amount of propane (a torch with the nozzle removed is 
perfect) into the engine via a good size vacuum port. The booster line 
should do nicely. The propane will cause a very rich condition and the 
output from the sensor should be greater than 600mV (0.6 volts) and 
probably closer to a volt. Now quickly remove the propane and because of 
the open hose we will have a lean condition and the output should drop to 
about 300mV (0.3 volts). This should happen in about 125mS. ( 1/8 
seconds) Going from lean to rich is actually a little quicker, about 
100mS (1/10 seconds). You won't be able to measure these times with a 
multimeter but I mention them to give an idea of how fast the response 
is. Don't forget that these times are from a change in the intake 
conditions to the sensor responding to the exhaust, the sensor itself is 
much faster. With a scope you can actually see variations in the signal 
due to leaking injectors, open plug leads etc. The O2 signal is a heck of 
a diagnostic aid. Vince, I suspect the response time differences you saw 
were more likely due to how quickly one was heated to 300+ degrees 
compared to the other. All zirconia sensors have a similar response time. 
So...... back to the original question, is there much difference? The 
answer is no. Some have heaters some do not, some have more or less wires 
and different connectors but they all work on the same principle. Save 
the money for something else.

Have I bored everyone to sleep yet?

PS We all know that silicon will screw up the sensor don't we?
