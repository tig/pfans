The rear window defogger isn't supposed to turn off when you push the
button. Pushing the button straight in picks a relay, which has a
timing function built into it. After about 15 minutes, the relay 
releases, and defogging stops. If you rotated the switch when you
pushed it in, defogging continues at reduced power. Now when you
turn the ignition off, defogging stops, and shouldn't start again
when you turn the ignition back on. If your defogging starts up
by itself when you turn the ignition on, sounds like either the
switch is physically stuck, or the relay is sticking.

The relay is expen$ive because it is really two relays and a timer
(and a Porsche part, of course).
