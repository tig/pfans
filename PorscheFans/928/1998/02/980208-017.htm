Hi all,
This question probably has been asked/answered on this list before, but I have
not seen it in the past few months that I have been a member. So, if this is
redundant, sorry.

Here's the question. Is the plastic 928 fuel tank internally coated with
something that protects it from the various solvents that are often found in
fuel injection cleaners, octane boosters, etc. These solvents are usually
toluene, acetone, or something similar, and normally turn many plastics to a
gooy mess. Even pump gasoline has ingredients that are harmful to plastics.
How is the 928 protected?

While I am not yet familiar with many aspects of the 928, I am familiar with
light aircraft. Anything plastic in an aircraft fuel system can, and
eventually will, cause great discomfort to the machine's operator.
