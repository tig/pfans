Hello all,
For everything you ever wanted to know about ignition wires, Magnecor has a
site at www. Magnecor .com.
I called them and spoke with Steve Brown about wires for an 87' and they would
have to be special made which is no problem for them, but he said that the
plug connector is a little weird and not exactly like the OEM ones. He needs
me to measure my wires between the boots and they'll make a set for me. He
offered to send me just one short one to see if I would be ok with the
different plug connector type. Cost would be about $200, and it's not that I'm
penny pinching, but rather these seem to be superior to the original wires. He
was very helpfull and willing to work with me on them. I bet he'd even give a
more reduced price for several orders, if anyones interested.   
Does any one on the list have these wires, and if so, are they the 8.5 KV's?
Also, what year car do you have them on, and what, if any problems?
How are the plug connectors, and do they look and function ok?
What's so weird about the connectors? 

Thanks,
