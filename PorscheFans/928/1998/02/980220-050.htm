 Oh, yeah...been there, done that, have the video-library.....
 Most likely it is a restricted warm-up regulator (aka 
control-regulator). This can be confirmed by measuring the 
control-pressure as per shop manual (I made my own "gauge" from an 
oil-pressure gauge, T-fitting (NPT), two two-foot pieces of fuel line and 
some hose clamps.) Normal control pressure is between 20lbs-55lbs, 
depending on the regulator's temperature. Colder = low pressures.  You 
most likely have full fuel-pump pressure there--something like 65-70 lbs, 
resulting in an excessively lean condition.
 Either a.) replace it, or
        b.) remove the 2 steel fuel-lines on top and heavily squirt some 
brake
            cleaner on the screens inside the inlet and outlet.
 If the symptoms still persist, then it is most likely the 
fuel-distributor.  (Although it can be taken apart, and "cleaned," it is 
VERY critical to put back together.  Rule: "Cleanliness is next 
Godliness.")
 I would suggest purchasing the regulator, or fuel-distributor from 928 
International (Mark, Jim, or Tom).

Hope this helps,

Marc
