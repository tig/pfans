I just found that my air pump was seized on my 86 928s.  It has been like this
for a week.  On my trip from chicago to tulsa, I heard a faint squeal, but I
thought it was some water from the rain on a belt. It went away ant today I
was working on the car and was idling it and noticed that the electric fan
turned on.  I looked at the temp gauge and saw that it was much higher than
usual.  I opened the hood and noticed the belt was gone from the airpump and
fan.  I have not been in any traffic and therefore the temp gauge showed
normal while I drove it the past week..

I noticed a little metallic dust on the airpump, Im guessing the front bearing
failed.
Is this repairable, or am I in the market for a used or rebuilt unit.
What am I looking at for a replacement unit$$$$?  Anyone buy one lately?
