	My 91 S4 occasionally just won't start at all.  The immobiliser
seems to 
	turn off okay, all the ignition lights come on, but turning the
key has 
	absolutely no effect - the dash lights don't even dim.  Leaving
the car 
	for 15 minutes or so seems to work - eventually it starts no
problem, 
	but this is becoming really infuriating and I'm dreading the
time it 
	happens on a petrol station forecourt in front of queue of
impatient 
	Porsche enviers.  Has anyone ever pushed a 928 single-handed?

	[snip]

	My thanks to  people who've already suggested culprits - I've
told the 
	dealers to replace the starter solenoid and deactivate the auto
gearbox 
	inhibitor switch (I've already replaced the battery and cleaned
the 
	ground connections). 

	Anyone?

	In a situation like this, I generally would take a brute force
approach.  With a schematic at hand, I would tap a wire at various break
points along the starting circuit.  Label it appropriately.  Leave the
wires where it would be accessible relatively fast.  Keep a voltmeter
handy in your 928.  When the situation arises again, start taking
voltage measurement at each tapped wire.  Make a note of each reading.
Armed with this information, you should be able to locate the culprit.
You should be able to tap into any circuit at the fuse panel and its
multiple connector plugs.

	I've used this approach successfully in troubleshooting a break
along the charging system's circuit.  The problem only occurs when I
drive the 928S for about 30-45 minutes, and never at idle.  Found that
the D+ wire has a heat and vibration problem within the engine harness.
Takes alot of patience and time, but pays off handsomely.  Good luck.
