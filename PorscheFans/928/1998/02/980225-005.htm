All of the intake manifold that I ever saw have a tan color.  It could
be call gold but it does not have any metallic shine to them.

Glen had his redone in Zemuratt silver and say they look exactly like
new.  I am not sure what "Zemuratt" means, but if it doesn't say
brown or tan, I would think that the intake I have seen are different
then Glen's.
