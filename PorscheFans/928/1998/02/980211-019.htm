	I've replaced quite a few relays on my 78.  The most expensive
was the fuel
	pump relay.  Dealer price was $67.00.  I got it from Smothers
International
	for $32.00.  They're on the net.

	Speaking of the fuel pump relay, mine just gave out one day.  It
was easy to pry the case off and discovered that there was a cold solder
joint on one of the circuit board pad.  This so happened to be on one
side of the contact's circuit that supply voltage to the fuel pump.
Took a 100 watt Weller solder gun and resoldered it.  It sank alot of
heat because the relay cage was copper and is used to complete the
circuit.  Reassembled and it works like new.  Before you throw away your
defective fuel pump relay, there's a high possibility that you can
resurrect it!
