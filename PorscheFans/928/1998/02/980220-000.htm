Hello shark fans!
I purchased a beautiful 86 928S three weeks ago -- ahhh bliss. I want to
thank all you contibuters here as you really filled me with enthusiasm
for this great car prior to getting it. Of course, now its the driving
that fills me with enthusiasm. But I do have a few questions:

1. I know the driver's door lock should activate the alarm system, but
is there some way that you know the alarm has been activated? (Other
than trying to break in, of course)
2. The car is a non-metallic dark blue; I'm pretty sure its an original
color-- anyone know what its called?
3. The car is an auto trans-- if I start in D2 and maintain, for
example, 40 mph and shift to D3 there appears to be no shift into the
next gear. Does that mean that I wasn't really in D2 to begin with? Is
there something I don't understand about the shifting logic of the
tranny? It was recently rebuilt before I got it.
4. Windshield and headlight washers don't work; how does this rate in
terms of difficulty and expense to right. I've already had my first
repair baptism with with the driver's doorlock and the rear hatch lock--
$230 for the driver' lock and $330 for both pieces of the hatch lock,
all new. Plus re-keying the locks and installation-- wow.
5. The speedo doesn't always register speed from a stop, but a light tap
on the instrument panel will get it going. Some circuit matt (?) has
been replaced recently, contacts cleaned, but nothing has resolved the
prob-- any ideas?

The car has 125K on it. I got the timing belt and H2O pump replaced,
because I knew that it had been at least 30K since it was done but
couldn't be sure exactly how many miles it was-- other 928 owners
convinced me it would be better to be safe than sorry. It has a
beautiful 2 tone interior-- saddle colored seats with dark blue dash all
in stitched leather. The Porsche dealership mechanic who checked it out
for me thought it was in super condition, all real tight, real dry
underneath.
 
Thanks in advance for whatever help you might have on this stuff AND for
sharing your enthusiasm for these great machines.
