I recently ran across an article about a great new device that connects to =
the positive cable of a car's battery, and automatically disconnects the =
current flow if the voltage falls to the point where a car won't be able =
to start.  Bottom line is your car will start, regardless of battery drain.=
  I'm a soon-to-be 928 owner, and have run across numerous owners talking =
about dead batteries if their cars sit for too long.  I've had similar =
problems with other German cars.  I figured this device may help.  The =
product, called PriorityStart, is pretty bulky though, and I don't know if =
it will fit in a 928; has anyone heard of, or used this product?  Does it =
work?  It costs about 80 bucks, and would seem like a life saver until you =
find where the drain is coming from.
