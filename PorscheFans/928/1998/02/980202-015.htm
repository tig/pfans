  This doesn't make the car an "S".  I called about it as well and they
  said they have the original window sticker for it indicating that it's
  a US-spec car.

  I wish you hadn't told them that.  I was going to see if they'd give me
  $14K-$15K for my '83 (which definitely doesn't look terrible) as a trade-in
  toward a new Infinity.  Then I could turn around and sell the Infinity and
  apply my $5K-$6K "profit" toward a GT!
