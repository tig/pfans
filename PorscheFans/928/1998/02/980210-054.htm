	My 85S doesn't have the 928S decal on the back and I'm thinking
about 
	replacing it. Question is, what colour should it be. Grey and
silver seem 
	to be the colours to choose from. My car is gold (weissgold or
something 
	like that) so I wonder what was on it originally? Decals are
also 
	available for the large P O R S C H E lettering on the back as
well. Mine 
	has the lettering molded into it, are they all that way or did
some just 
	have decals? Perhaps the decal is supposed to sit in the moulded
letter 
	but I think that would be a bit too loud for my tastes.

My '83 S is hellbronze.  Probably a a few shade darker to your
weissgold.  My letterings are in grey.  It look terrific!  The P O R S C
H E decal does sit in the molded letter from the factory on mine.  Looks
REALLY nice...  If I can find a scan of my rear (eh.. the '83 S that
is..) I'll email it to you.

	I found red fluid under the front of car. I thought the worst
(steering 
	rack) but was pleased to see that it was a leak from a hose. It
seems to 
	have swelled a little where it connects to the reservoir. Is
there 
	anything special about the rubber used in the hose, i.e. do I
have to buy 
	something specifically made for the job, or is a more generic
hose OK?

	Colin

	I went with the oem hoses just because they're prefab.  You
might want to change out the reservoir since the filter inside is not
replaceable.  Cost about $30 for my '83 S.
