The power steering in my '83 S has failed and it's now harder to turn than
a bus with flat tyres. My biceps are looking all the better for it, but I
really should fix it.

It started playing up a while back, then came right again, then later
failed completely while I was executing a hard left. I assume that this is
a rack failure rather than a pump failure. Is there a quick and dirty
method of testing the pump to make sure? Fluid levels are fine.

I looked in the FAQ but couldn't find a scetion on rack replacement. Are
there any traps for young players that aren't mentioned in the 928 service
manual?

If I replace the rack, is there anything else I should do at the same time?
Hoses/reservoir?

Thanks for any assistance,
