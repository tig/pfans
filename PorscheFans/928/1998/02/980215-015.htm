Hi Steve,

Sorry it took so long to continue the dialog on whether the S4's have the
capability to run the cooling fans while the engine is off (and key removed).

I believe it was left with you asking for anybody actually having the cooling
fans run while the engine was turned off.

It has happened to me twice. Both times during warm days.

My original inquery came about as I was comparing my newly purchased S4 to my
recently sold 1988 944 Turbo S. With the 944, the fan would come on frequently
after I had turned the engine off on warm days. On similiar days, I noticed
the 928's fans would.  I started researching this which led me to ask the
questions. I know the manual says they should and you've looked at the wiring
diagram and aren't so sure they could.
I know the 944 and 928 are different engines, but that's the closet
comparision I had. I did notice that if I returned within a few minutes of
turning off the engine, the 944 temperature gauge would read very high, until
I got the engine going at which time the temp would drop down into the normal
range. That I would expect with the circulating coolant. I noticed no such
phenomenia with the 928. A few minutes after shut down, I turn the key
(without starting the motor) to get a temp reading and it's still in the
normal range. I would expect it to get hotter like the 944. I don't know if
that's a function of the engine or the gage.

From the subscribers response I gather their fans rarely if ever come on with
the engine off. But as I said, mine have done that twice, both times about 2
minutes after I turned the engine off. It happened on warm, but not hot days.
So I figured I had an intermitent problem.

At any rate, what a puzzle.

Thanks for your input,
