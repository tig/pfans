	This sounds more like a dead fuel pump, can you verify with your
	mechanic that yes indeed the pump powers up at IGN on / etc. ?  I find
	it hard to believe the FI brain 'goes'.  General industry stats show
	less than 20% of brains returned are actually defective.

	Of course if you've had recent bodywork involving welding, all bets are
	off!

	Let us know what happens...

	Aiea class of '78    Na Ali'i o Aiea - 78, we rate!

	... sounds like a bad fuel pump relay too!  The same thing happened to me on I-5.
Jumpered pin 87 and 30 with a hair pin that I found along the freeway to bypass the relay
so that I can drive home.  People was staring, wondering what this poor man doing, pacing
up and down the freeway with his head down toward the ground.  And fifty feet away, a
Porsche 928 with its hood up... a VERY sad sight.   :-)
