Hey, was anybody on this list the guy driving the gray 928S on I-40 heading
into Nashville on Saturday that got the thumbs up from the guy in the white
Toyota???

If so, that was me :) and you have a really cool car.  I wish I could've
washed mine before coming down that way...

Anyways, anyone in Nashville??  I will probably be back there about the
middle of the month during March and will have a few hours to blow in the
afternoon quite possibly if anyone is there and wouldn't mind a
928-owner-to-be drooling on their car (just kidding) and talking Porsches
for a bit.

Andrew
