Hi Barry,

I found my 79 US for $4500 US and it needed about $3000 to get it on the
road. I will probably have $5k in mods and fixes before I'm satisfied.
There have been several posts recommending spending $10k to get a good car.
I think $10k is a good benchmark. I didn't have the wisdom of this list
when I bought mine. If I did I would have waited and searched more. Just my
$9.28. 

That doesn't mean that I haven't enjoyed digging into this fine piece of
German roadware. The elegance of the design really shows itself when you
dig into some of the major systems and components. It's like having your
own custom GT car, but it's all stock,and comfy to boot! Way cool.

Good luck,


Jay Kempf
