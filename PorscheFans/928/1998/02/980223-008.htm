>>Just wondering whether you've got any response to your query regarding
shift
knob for 928?  As I have also looked up and down and only found two
sources:
928Intl sells a carbon fibre knob for $199.00  Haven't asked them for
detail
as it's a bit expensive IMHO.  In UK there is one guy who does alloy shift
knob for 911, I'm trying to convince him fabricating one for 928.  That's
about all the sources I can see.  As you correctly pointed out, the shift
knob
and boot all covered in leather present a big problem as well as the shift
lever being rectangular shape rather than round cylindrical...Please let me
know if you know of any other sources.  Thanks.<<

Alec,

Your email was very timely. I have actually received a lot of reponses to
the query about modifying (i.e. cutting) the stock lever, and was actually
going to do the job this weekend.  Some of the responses simply said to
take a hacksaw to the stock lever, others suggested using a dremel-type
tool with a cut-off wheel for a quicker and cleaner job.  Since I don't
have a dremel tool, I figured I'd use my $5 hacksaw. I pulled the stock
knob and boot off to see what I was up against, and concluded that although
the hacksaw probably would work fine, a dremel would be more desirable.  I
thought that an alternative might be to install an aftermarket knob, but
after pulling the stock knob, you'll find that the problem isn't the knob,
it is the length of the shift lever.   I think the most economical, and
probably easiest way of shortening the lever is to cut.

As far as installing aftermarket knobs, I may have a solution that will
only cost you about $12 for the modification.  Automotion advertises that
they sell Momo and Dino knobs that will fit the 928 with the help of their
adapter.  Well, out of curosity, I ordered the adapter by itself to see
what it entailed.  I received it this weekend.  The adapter is simply a
metal cylindrical sleeve that slides down over the stock rectangular lever.
I slid it on yesterday, and it is actually a pretty good fit.
Unfortunately, I don't have an aftermarket knob to test on it yet.  This
modification will not shorten the lever, but I think it will definitely
allow you to fit an aftermarket knob (although you will have to cut the
stock boot or order a new one due to the one-piece design of the stock
boot).

Let me know if you plan to cut your lever, and I can forward a few posts
that I received which give step by step instructions.  If you or anyone on
the list needs info. on the adapter from Automotion let me know.  The
adapter normally sells for $14.95 (pricey for a small piece of metal) but
it is currently 20% off during their February clearance sale.
