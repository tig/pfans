Colin, Stephane,

If you look at an almost new 928 you will see that it is still silver in
most cases.
I often wondered about that "tan" color myself until I parted out the 91 GT
with only 17K miles on it and was amazed to see that all of those items were
a nice silver color. I have since investigated and concluded the original
color of the valve covers and intake was silver. It gets the tan color from
heat over the years. (this restored my faith in Porsche's engine color
choices which had been in doubt for many years)

The newer epoxy mixes are supposed to slow down or eliminate this "tanning"
problem. (you may want to try some sunscreen also)
