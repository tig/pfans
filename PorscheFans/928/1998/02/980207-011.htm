It never ceases to amaze (or impress) me as to the number of scientific/

I've heard that most of the people who buy 928s are pilots and/or technical
people and that artists are attracted to the curves of the 911 variants.
Should we take a straw pole among the 1000+ on this list. I think it's a
head vs. heart thing.

Real WORKING artists are, in my experience, the most absolutely pragmatic
people you'll ever meet.  There are too many $$ issues and other life
challenges for it to be otherwise.  Your contention may be true for "artistic
types" who's tastes & fancies do not directly affect either paying for their
kids' orthodontia or their souls.  With musicians & Porsches: flute players
pick 911, cellists take 928, and bassists, tympanists & harpsts go Suburban.

As far as the straw poll goes; yeah, I got straw.   ~~:^-}
