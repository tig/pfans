Hi All,
        I am a young owner (21) and although I bought my car in April I
first drove a 928 when I was 10 that's right 10. My father bought a new
86 928s (auto) and one day when we were at a private airport and they
were shooting the movie "Look who's Talking" and that's were my father
had his plane stored so we were aloud to be around while they were
filming. This was the first time I had ever driven a car (I was good at
driving go-carts though) and when I first started driving I stepped on
the gas a little to hard and scarred the "*&$$" out of my father but
after that I was fine. The funny thing is the cast and crew were
standing around and the 928 was still a "hot" car and my fathers was
only a year old and when I drove by they all looked like they saw a
ghost, My father swears John Travolta was one of the on-lookers but I
was to busy trying not to crash to even care about if "John Travolta"
was looking. I also drove a 928 the first day I had my license and
showed my friends how easy the 928 would beat a Honda and how easy it is
to go 230 kms on a clear highway.


As for being a young driver I do drive too fast and sometimes my ego
puts me into dangerous situations but I would rather be in 928 that is a
safe car that is designed for going fast and not a Camero or a Mustang
or a Vette that so many other young drivers drive and end up crashing
because they are so poorly designed. 

Thanks,
J.Brown- the youngest driver ever to drive a 928 without being on some
one's lap?
