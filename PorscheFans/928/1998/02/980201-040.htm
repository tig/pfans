Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

The infamous heater control unit is probably the eakest link in the 928. I
too have been bitten (pardon the pun) by its tempermental function or lack
thereof. I was able to improve its temp control by replacing the small fan
that draws cabin air through the cabin thermostat. It still isn't perfect,
so the next step is to trace the vacuum lines for leaks. While it's Winter,
the warm (hot) air isn't a problem. Come Summer, it may well be a stifling
problem.

928 Int'l informed me that the passenger and driver side locks are not
interchangeable. Since I could lock the car with the passenger lock until
the driver's lock arrived, it did not matter.  Also, I wouldn't have to mess
around with a lock that works perfectly.

I mentioned that I had some 89' brochures. I was mistaken. The two I have
are for the 90' MY. I also have one 85' on 928s and one on all 85' models,
one on all 87' models, one each for all models in 91', 92', & 93'. Also, I
still have a few XL "928 Frenzy" polo shirts.

Happy motoring. Ed
