I remember the scene from Risky Business with the sound of the motor as the
car was backing out of the garage, and stalled (I have done that a time or 2)
I was hooked after that!

I have owned it for 2 years now, as much as I love it Baby #1 on the way!

-The car is listed as Meteor, I call it gray metallic
-Burgundy Interior 
-CD Player
-5 speed
-58,000 miles
-limited slip
-leather trim
-heated seats
-New Dunlop SP4000s all around

My mechanic (x-porsche dealer) thinks it is one of the best conditioned ones
he has seen,  I fell in love with it the moment I saw it. The car has always
been garaged and covered, the first owner, computer guru did not like the feel
of the original cluth, mechanic said it was ok but still put a new one in 95,
new timing belt, etc. etc. etc. have all the receipts. 

$17,500.00
Someday I will have a GTS 
.
