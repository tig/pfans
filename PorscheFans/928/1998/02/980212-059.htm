JP G'day

I MUST say you write beautiful prose...hehe I could actually see the pub
and the rythmic movement of elbows ..spot on!!

However on the point of the "football" match, are you SURE it was an Aussie
Rules game? I have a sneaky suspision that it MIGHT have been "Rugby League"
rather
than its backward "parochial" cousin (also known as "aerial ping pong" to
the rugby bretheren).

I can't recall ever seeing an Aussie rules match played between us and NZ
(?)
Rugby League is not unlike your Grid Iron ..however it's a bit MORE
butch/macho
down here. They don't wear anywhere near the amount of padding OR helmets
but still play with ALL the enthusiasm your players show in your games.
(madness)

The most popular events in Rugby League (apart from the "Grand Finals" of
course) are the "State of Origin" matches which is basically a match up
between two rival states of Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. Much
"biffo" goes on in these matches
and the TV ratings go through the roof for the network lucky enough to
televise the matches hehe...

BTW did I tell you the colour of my PORSCHE 928S is Crystal Green Metallic?
I did? ..good!! (phew)

Kind regards,
