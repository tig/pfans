	The cheap belt tensioner (no longer available) did twist the belt.  It 
had two parts on a hinge and a spring, put the belt in the slot hold the 
other part and pull the tool up till it touched the engine.  This way you 
would always twist the tool the same amount (about 90 deg), then read the 
tension, if the two marks on the tool lined up.  If the belt were to 
loose it would twist very easy and the 2 marks on the tool wouldn't line 
up.  If the belt were very tight it would hardly twist at all while the 
tool is twisted 90 deg.  Don't know how accurate that could be, all 
depends on the spring.

	The tool was just two pieces of aluminum a shoulder bolt (hinge) and a 
spring.  Problem it could only be used to measure one belt, the new tool 
with the dial can be used to measure all the belts on  both water pumpers 
(944's and 928's).  Now the question; if somebody on this list did 
reinvent the old tool how many of us would buy it?  Lets assume we still 
want the precision of the dial tool, we could change the belt leave off 
one cover and let the dealer do the final adjust.  Or if the cheap tool 
is accurate enough.....   If sombody thought they could sell 50 or more 
it should sell cheap, problem is in calibrating, that and having 
everybody believe you did your homework.  Anybody know if they ever had a 
problem with the original cheap tool?  For $50 I bet they could be gold 
plated!

	It could eliminate a potential problem with the dial tool, going to the 
wrong setting.  I did that, ( long story ) any how using sombody elses 
manual, page out of place,  set it for the alternater tension.  The belt 
didn't break, the carrier wasn't lined up right, that may have saved 
bigger problems. Due to too much tension the belt worked its way forward, 
smoke came off the front edge of the belt.  Didn't sombody recently break 
a belt soon after a retension, don't like to stir up trouble, but if they 
set it to the wrong setting or if the tool were not calibrated.

	Most other cars have a spring tensioner on the car!  Pry the tensioner 
back, bolt it down, replace the belt, release the tensioner then lock it 
down. THATS IT!  Why did Porsche go and complicate a simple thing?

	PAN BOLTS;  I can see the problem with using loctite, any glue given to 
much area to adhere to won't come off.  I wouldn't try just putting a 
little on the last few threads, bet the glue will wick all the way down 
the bolt.  I build and fly model airplanes, it's incredible what glue 
will do.  Loctite does make a GREEN thread locker, very thin stuff to be 
put on after assembly.  I think it would be safe to put the GREEN stuff 
on the bolt heads, that shouldn't get to the threads.  I was working a 
ford awhile back the valve covers have cork gaskets, like our oil pan. 
The valve covers had a boss at each bolt hole, just tighten the bolts and 
the gasket would be properly clamped.  Seems like for what the 928 cost 
they could have used shoulder bolts, could just tight those down and the 
gasket would be perfect every time!  or a raised boss around each bolt 
hole, of course that would have eliminated the skill required to put it 
together correctly!
