I have them on my  87 951 and they went on perfectly, without any problems
- have had them for about a year.  The connectors were different from stock
but they fit fine.
At the time he did not have any connectors/wires for my 944S (same
connectors as the  32 valve 928) The 8.5 KVs snap fit into the stock loom
separators. I was told that the internal wire in the 8.5mm is the same as
in the 10mm wires - just different (thicker) casing for high heat racing
applications.  They were cheaper than stock and appear to be a better
product.  Do not expect any horsepower or performance increase though,
unless your old ones were shot to begin with.

The 951 (8 valve) connectors were one piece rubber - not weird just
different.  I don't know what the 16/32 valvers would be like, since the
stock BERU ones are such long plastic snorkels.

I would recommend them.
Hope this helps.
