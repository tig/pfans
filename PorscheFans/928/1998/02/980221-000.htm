hi guys.

I live in Australia and have begun my search for the car of my dreams. I
currently drive a triumph convertible tr8 which is going up for sale.

Anyway, i will have between Australian$ 30,000 to 55,000 to spend and can
spend the 55,000 but dont know whether its worth spending the extra amount
of money on the s4. Ive got quotes for insurance etc so all that part is fine.

the big question is what do i buy for the best value for money. ive been
told to stick to automatics due to gearbox problems, have no chance of
finding black, and but only from an authorised porsche showroom. what do i
look for in a good car, and what are the major expenses i will find in
owning one. im in my last year of uni and paying for this out of my own
pocket with a bank loan to bridge the gap, so every dollar does count. I do
want to buy a car running on unleaded though, i believe 85/86 and above and
have been told the 86 928s has the s4 gear in it anyway.

eagerly awaiting 

Nicholas Ridis
