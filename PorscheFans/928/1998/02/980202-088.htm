I found a cheap spark plug boot puller makes the job easier - plus the
tool can be used to remove interior clips and such on other projects...

Your big decision will be the factory but pricey OEM wires vs.
aftermarket.  I would definately keep away from any crimp-it-yourself
sets - even if you buy a real nice plug wire crimp tool the boots &
pieces in those kits are pretty crappy!  I tried Magnecor on my old '84
and was pleased with price / quality / construction / performance.  Much
has been made of the Nology wires but I have also heard they cause alot
of EMI so be careful they could throw off electronic ignitions or stereo
performance in the least.  

I also played around with plugs a bit.  Splitfires affected idle
negatively but I did post good 1/4 times with the 928 S.  Torquemasters
felt really snappy at high revs on the GT and I really like them except
for accelerated electrode wearing.  Bosch platinums are an inexpensive,
good all around street plug.  Devek had recommended triple-electrode GTS
spec plugs and I'd like to try those.  I don't recall if they were of
the "protruding" type as those are supposed to be worth maybe a horse or
two on non-forced induction engines.

Did someone buy up all those Mann oil filters Susan had for just $3
each?  That was a steal!

I say go for it Matt and have fun - the basic freshen up tune is
definately a can do!
