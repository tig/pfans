The oldest 928s come from a time when fuel consumption and emissions issues
were acute, at least in the US, and engine control technology hadn't yet
provided tractable solutions to providing performance under these
constraints; those cars are happy with 87 octane fuel. So, check your car's
manual and stickers. Newer cars need premium (at least 92 octane by US
labeling, which averages "research" and "motor" octane ratings; European
vendors tend just to quite the former, also known as "RON"), but will adapt
(by becoming sluggish and losing power) to lower octane juice.

>and only Shell products.

Technical issues aside, there used to be a stock ownership tie-in between
the Porsche family and Shell. Now that this is gone, new Porsches come with
Mobil 1 in the crankcase (or oil tank) and no Shell recommendations.

Meanwhile, there's nothing wrong with Shell gas, which is what my friendly
local station pumps, and whose premium is labeled at 93 octane, but I often
fill 'er up with Sunoco 94. Mobil premium works fine too.
