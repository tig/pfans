Glenn - My car has the same brakes, and it did have pretty severe
fade on the track. I did two things: changed the fluid to Ate Blue
(from Castrol LMA) and changed the pads to Performance Friction
80 compound, which came from OG Racing. Since both were changed
at the same time, I don't know which helped most, but the fade
is cured. The pads do squeak some, particularly in hot weather.
They work well when cold, even better once they're warmed up.
And yes, the wheels get filthy dirty on the track.

If you do get braided steel hoses you should be sure they're DOT-
legal. I don't personally think they're necessary if you bleed
the brakes frequently.

>>
If I understood correctly, we were told at the NER 928 Tech Session
that home rebuilds of 928 racks usually failed pretty quickly.
Unfortunately I don't remember why, but somebody else on the list
might know.
