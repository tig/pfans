A friend and I validated that this can be done with
an industrial strobe light we borrowed from an aerospace
co., but with visible light rather than infared. 
Very high luminosity IR LED's are available nowadays that
might be worth a try, but my proffesional judgement is that
the detectors are a relatively narrow band, at least as far as
visible vs. other light. Typically, you'll need an IR detector
to detect IR light and a visible detector to detect visible
light. 

Of course, I'd rather be wrong...
