Avoid driving the car until you repack the CV joints.  It does not take
much for them to getchewed up.  You might want to compare the cost of
replacing the boot or replacing the
whole axle.  It might be cheaper in the long run if debris are already
present in the joint.

I would be tempted to change the engine oil and maybe even the
transmission fluid.If there was any way that water could have entered in
these, you are better off
with fresh fluids.

Happy to know that you got the car out in time.
