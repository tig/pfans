To take the S4 manifold out (from memory):Unplug the battery (just in
case)
Remove the trottle linkage (on the passenger side of the manifold)
remove the large vacuum line from the manifold
remove the fuel rail covers
Remove the small 2 nuts that holds the fuel rail
undo the fuel rail fuel supply connectors at each end
Unplug the injectors
lift the fuel rail (the injectors will come with the rail)
Undo the 2 rubber line going from under the manifold to the passenger
side valve cover
Undo the 10 or so bolts that holds the manifold down (watch out not to
loose the steel washer)
Undo the support for the passenger side fuel damper (or regulator, the
one in the back) to
remove its bracket which lie on top of the manifold)
lift the manifold

What you will (or might) need.

Injector rebuild kit (8).  If the injector seals are dried out, you will
need to replace them.  You
could just buy the seals themselves, but if your car has quite a few
miles, why not rebuild
the injectors

Intake manifold gasket (2).  If the car is old enough, these gaskets
might be dried out and in
need of replacement.

The manifold needs to be lifted straight up because of the number of
studs around it.  An extra
pair of hands will come in handy.  The manifold on the S4 I worked on
was almost "glued"
to the engine.  we required to pry it off a little to undo this so dont
be surprised.

Installation is the reverse of installation but watch for:

Remove all the ruber and steel spacer from the stud that holds the
manifold
put the manifold gasket on.
put the manifold over the engine
run the 2 rubber line going to the passenger valve cover through the
manifold "legs"
MAKE SURE ARE THE VACUUM LINE ARE IN PLACE
put the manifold down (watch for the fuel line on the passenger side, it
can be in the way)
put all the rubber and steel spacers on the manifold holder studs to
line up the manifold
tighten the manifold evenly (go around all the nuts a couple of time
before torquing them
to the appropriate setting)
You need to lube the seals of the injectors prior to put them back on
the manifold.
Insert the spring clip on the injector connectors.
Put the injector connectors on the injectors


That is all I can remember.  Watch out for those injector connector
clip.  They have
a tendency to fly off and are hard to find due to their size.  Be
patient when attempting
to put the clip back on the connector.  I had a hard time making them
hold until I got
a hang of it.
