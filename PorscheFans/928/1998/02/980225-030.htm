And while you're doing that, James, strip that extra apostrophe out
of "badges" and the unnecessary one from "its".  Repowered Porsches
bother me less than silly punctuation, and I know this applies to
others on this list, too.

As much as I was dismayed at Patrick's initial comments about his
project, I've been following it now for six months and can appreciate
the effort that he's gone to and the good job he appears to be making.

There seems to be a whole culture in the US of repowering cars with
bigger engines, not necessarily of the same make.  While I personally
wouldn't do a 928 with an American engine I can understand the idea
and I don't think it's offensive at all.

Patrick, I support your right to power your 928 with whatever you wish
and to leave the badges on it.
