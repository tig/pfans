    I'm new to the list and actually don't own a 928 YET......I am currently
looking for an 89 or newer 928S4.  Reading the list give me a chance to see
what a 928 owner goes thru regarding some of the "little" problems these fine
machines have.  I am 32 and fell in love with the 928 when I was around 16.
Now that I can afford one, there aren't that many around to choose from.  Just
taking my time, looking for the right color combo,(red/tan, Black/Black,)
Right now this is all I have to offer to the list....but when I get my 928 I'm
sure I will be a regular....with lots of questions!!!!!!!
