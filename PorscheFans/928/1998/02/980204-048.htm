A few comments all in one email if I may

Badgasometer

Neat idea but not as easy as it sounds I suspect. Measuring advance would 
not be terribly difficult but the trick is to know what to compare it 
with. That's to say, where is the timing on the map (in the prom) now 
versus where would it be with "good" gas.


Dave/ Vince/ Phil/ etc

As you can tell from my email address I have to agree with and thank you 
for your comments on meters. I'm also real interested in the melted meter 
story. There is actually some automotive stuff on our Web page with some 
troubleshooting hints. Its rather generic of course but most of it 
applies. The beat the book part is probably of most interest. You can get 
to our web site at fluke.com and look around or you can jump to the 
automotive specific bits at fluke.com/autotools/. We used to have this in 
a printed format but have run out. I'll see if I can get it in electronic 
format if anyone is interested.

DIN/ SAE

Do I remember reading somewhere that Ford changed the way they measured 
the HP on the 5 liter Mustang? Seems to me that the same engine was rated 
about 10 BHP lower one year even though it was the same motor. I suspect 
it might have been the SAE who pushed for the change.

Cylinder Walls

I'm pretty sure the cylinder walls are etched to expose the hard stuff. 
This process, Nikasil or something like that, was pretty unique and high 
tech when the 928 first appeared but is much more common these days. The 
911 now uses it as well I think.

Seat belt warning.

Mine comes on intermittently also. It certainly seems to do so more 
frequently if I put something with some weight on the passenger seat so I 
assume there might be a contact of some sort in the seat that detects if 
a body is in the seat or not. Perhaps that contact is the problem.

205's or 225's

I think 205's were a standard size at one time with 225's being optional. 
Were the 205's on 15 inch rims and the 225's on 16? I think its in the 
owners manual but I don't have it with me.

To digest or not.

100+ messages in non digest mode!! I don't think so. I'd never get any 
work done at all. Especially if they were all as long as this one.
