Greg and Kurt:

Forgive me for jumping in, especially since I didn't see the message
to which Greg was replying (I don't normally read the 928 list)...
But I think a clarification might be in order here.

A lower final-drive ratio may improve acceleration times (or it may
not, depending on how quickly you shift and how many gears you have to
go through on your acceleration run), but...

Lowering the final-drive ratio doesn't affect the spread between
gears; a transmission with a lower (numerically higher) final-drive
ratio is NOT a "close-ratio" gearbox; you'll still have to shift at
the same points, and the total area under the engine power curve
through the gears will be the same as with a taller (numerically
lower) final-drive ratio.
