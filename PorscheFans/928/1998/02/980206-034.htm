	A few days ago somebody broke a timing belt and was wondering about the 
extent of damage.  Well if it was idleing or tuning very low RPM it might 
not be that bad.  A long time ago I had a ford Escort, the water pump 
went bad and ripped the timing belt off.  I was trying to limp home, I 
kept the RPM very low, so it broke the belt just above idle.  I bent one 
valve, not sure how much damage was to the piston, hey it was a ford.  
Had the head rebuilt and ran it for another 130,000 miles.  I did replace 
the belts and water pump every 60,000 miles, got good at it after a 
while!  Always replace the timing belt at the recomened intervel and just 
as important, if the timing belt drives the water pump change that to.  
On a 928 the water pump pulley doesn't have teeth so it might slip on the 
belt if the water pump bearing fails, but I wouldn't want to find out.  
Alot of the cost of the repair will be labor, taking things apart and 
putting them back together.  Do you feel up to taking the heads off, if 
only one bent valve no way of knowing which side.  With a little luck you 
should need 1 or 2 new valves and possiblly a piston or two.  Might as 
well change the rings and rod bearings, might be able to leave the block 
in the car.  My ford piston had very minor damage from the valve, if it 
had been a porsche engine I would have changed the piston.

			GOOD LUCK

	Question my rear window defogger switch works fine if turned but if 
pushed it won't pop back(turn off), if pushed I have to disconnect the 
battery to turn it off.  The relay cost $100.00, thats just to much!  Is 
it possible to fix the relay? Or can I make it not function in the push 
mode, It would be fine if it would pop back after being pushed and only 
worked when turned.  If I forget and push it I gotta disconnect the 
battery typically in the rain!  What holds the switch down? The relay or 
the switch?  Am I the only one to cheap to spend $100 on a relay?  I have 
other fish to fry, other more pressing problems, if this were the only 
problem then maybe I would just spend the money.
