Brake fluid has a tendency to absorb water.  This is bad for 2 reasons:

The more water you have in your fluid, the faster you will develop rust
inside your calipers.  Those thing are machined to a close tolerance
so a bit of rust will make them unserviceable (the reason why its bad
for
the caliper)

The other reason is boiling point of the fluid.  When you brake, the
cars
energy is transformed into heat.  The calipers get hot and heat up the
brake fluid.  The reason why the hydraulic system work is because the
fluid is not
compressible.  When the fluid heats up, the water it contains boils up
and
turn into steam.  This will result in brake fade or even failiure. 
Changing
the fluid ensure that it contains the minimum amount of moisture (this
is also
why brake fluid have a seal on the bottle and that you should never use
brake
fluid that has sat around for a while).

 Also, did anyone know how to keep the windshield wipers from

Which Gas additive do you add?  Octane boost will only help an engine
perform better if you have lower octane gas then what your car require.

Detergent will keep the system cleaner.  You will not notice an
improvemement
in performance but it should not degrade with time.
