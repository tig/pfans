	The tool does not measure torque.  It does not twist the belt
	in any way but measure how thight it is.  It look something like
	this:

	         O
	==================
	    O          O

	One of the 3 roller (O) is lifted to a predetermined position.
The
	central roller is spring loaded.  Once you reach the position,
you 
	release the tool and you look how much the central roller
actually
	moved.

	... then perhaps using a micrometer will get you the same
result.  Assuming that you have the data points to begin with.
