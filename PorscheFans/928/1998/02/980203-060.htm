Remove the black plastic cover at the front of the seat (2 philips
screws)
Try to move the seat forward; do you see the little servo motor trying
to
turn?

If not, you have a fuse or connection problem.  If you need to move your
seat
now, you can insert an allen wrench in the opening on top of the gear
and 
move the seat manually.

If the motor is trying to move, it means that one or both of tracks are
locked
in place.  You must look for an obvious problem with the track.  If
nothing
obvious, you can disconnect the cable from the front motor to the
actuators.
Try to turn the actuating cable using a small wrench.  Hopefully, you
can
unlock the motor with a little elbow juice.  if you get it moving, your
problem
is solved if not, ???

Good luck
