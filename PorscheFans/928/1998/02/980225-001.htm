Last week I asked some questions about tires and handbrake and got some
answers, thanks. But what I didn't mention about the tires was that my
wheels are 9,5 inch. I currently have 265/40 17 tires. What tire size
should I choose not to get to high final gear ratio? Someone suggested
255/40 17, will these tires fit on 9,5 inch wheel. Should I buy 265/35 17
to get the same gear ratio? Any suggestions?

Regarding my handbrake I did as some of you suggested, the cable is
intact so I will probably have to remove the rotors :-( to change the
....whatever it's called in English...
I suspect that the reason for this wear is (just bought the car) that the
handbrake switch was stuck and the handbrake light never came on. Quite
common failure on european cars that use this kind of switch. So here I am
with a broken handbrake.

Then I started to look in to why the radio doesn't work, and of course
the antenna wire wasn't fitted into the radio. Someone has cut of the
coax connector that is supposed to fit into the radio and replaced it
with a flat connector (!) I guess that someone didn't know what he/she 
was doing. So the question is, I saw a small cable that was going along
with the coax cable, what is that?

The next thing to investige was the digital clock that neither works
because it doesn't have any current. The leads to the clock isn't
connected. Which connector is plus the upper or the sideway connector?

Ok, I won't ask more tiresome questions for now.... :-)

Thanks
