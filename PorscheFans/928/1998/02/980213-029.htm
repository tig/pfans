The lower ball joint supports on 928s built prior to MY 1983 were aluminum.  Those built as MY 1983 and later used the same steel lower ball joint support that you already have in your 1985
928S.  The aluminum supports have been known to fracture.  The few failures reported on the 928 list have thankfully happened at low speeds and not resulted in injury.

Although I don't currently race or autocross my 1982 928, I may want to take a PCA drivers' ed class some day (that is usually a high speed track event).  And, based on even a few  reports of
AL ball joint support failure, I think it prudent to do the upgrade to the steel supports even though my ball joints are fine.  As I understand it, the ball joint comes with the support and
is not available seperately so any ball joint replacement with a new part will have the latest steel support.--
