I have followed some recent postings regarding a 928 model, and just
noticed that in the current issue of Excellence there is an ad for
a 928 GTS 1/18 scale on pg 132.

I am transforming/evolving my '79 928 euro into a hard-core track car
and I have several items I no longer need.  Most of the items available
are interior related, but some mechanical items are up for grabs.
  Examples:  full interior, sans dash
    	     power antenna assmbly including motor
	     cruise control assmbly
             power window motors (2)
             rear wiper motor assmbly

all items are in good condition.  Please help me get rid of this stuff
before my wife insists that I throw them out!!

I have also seen posts re:  transaxle upgrades.  Is there an authority
out there that could let those of us who are less-informed know of 
the feasibility of the process.  Would a torque-tube and/or clutch &
bell housing upgrade be necessary?  I would like to upgrade to the
Borg-Warner transaxle in the mid-86 up models.

thanks(in advance) for your input
