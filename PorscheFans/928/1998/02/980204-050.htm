Hi Chihiro and all:

Gosh I have been racking my brain on this and unable to come to any
conclusions as well.  Instead of the chicken and the egg, we have the
body style vs. the mechanicals!!!  Though there is no doubt in my mind
that if that lovely V8 wasn't in the car I'd be driving something else I
am just as sure about my attraction to the 928's timeless body design
from any angle!  FWIW I think I heard it first, then saw it when the 928
first got it's hooks into me so maybe it's more mechanical?

I think I am an artistic soul trapped in a techical body or was it the
other way around?

Sounds like we're all similar people after all!?
