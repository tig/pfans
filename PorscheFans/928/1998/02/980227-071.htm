A search engine at last! Sounds too good to be true. Tons of good stuff 
out there but no easy way to find it. Is it just me or has anyone else 
noticed how a lot more questions go unanswered lately. Mostly I suspect 
because its the umpteenth time the same question has been posted and 
everyone assumes someone else will answer or perhaps can't face saying 
the same thing yet again. This is typically not the fault of the person 
posing the question as they're often new to the list and would not have 
seen a previous response. The search engine will fix that. Can't wait. 
With all that in mind, someone asked about getting at the idle speed 
regulator without removing the intake manifolds. Ask again and I'll dig 
up my previous post.
