I tried to adjust the ride height of my car and I had very little
success.  Here is what I did:

My car was about 15 mm to low in the front.  So i jacked up the front of
the car and turned each perch up, well counterclockwise, 7 turn on
each side. According to Ed's procedure, this should have raised the
car 14 mm or so.  

Went to drive the car for ~ 5 minutes ove some bumpy pavement to 
exercise the suspension.  Go back home, the car is now sitting at 140 mm
(or 30 mm too low).  So, logic would tell, I turned the adapters the
wrong way.  So I undo the 7 turns and put 3 extra turn clockwise.  I
don't do it more because at this point, I can turn the adapter ring by
hand.

back for a 5 minute spin.  Measure and get 130 mm!!!  At this point,
I am very confuse.  Put the car adjusters where they started and turn
another 10 turn counterclockwise.  Usual drive and get ~ 150 mm reading.

At this point, I stop.

I did not try to raise the car even more because there is already a 20 
mm opening between the tire and the fender and I think it might look
funny if I raise the car another 20 mm.  this would give my shark a
SUV look.

Any comment are welcome.  What distance do you see between your
fender and your tire?
