John & Phil,
I was thinking that the Devak setup was to stiff for our crappy
Michigan roads, but if anyone is using it, what do you think?
Has anyone else felt this handling condition? I'm wondering if my
front springs are sacked out? You have to push the car pretty hard
for it to happen.

PS. the 90GT that I used to own did the same thing, but not quite
as bad.
