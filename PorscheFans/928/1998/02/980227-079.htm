While looking for a European Car magazaine at Borders, I picked up '911
& Porsche World', number 48.   There were several 928-related items.
One report was a fellow in GB that uses a 1980S for work and runs as
much as 1000 miles per week!    It was well written and retells many of
the trials and tribulations discussed in here.

Another article referred to a female Porsche technician.   It was
written with too much gender insensitivity for my taste (constant
reference to 'girls' and such), but an interesting paragraph follows:

Sue has her favourites in the workshop, too.  'The 993 is great to work
on, as is the 968.  On the other hand, I'm not that keen on the 928.
It's a pig to do even something simple like a cam-belt change.  It's
just so complex.'

Check it out - I was pleasantly surprised.
