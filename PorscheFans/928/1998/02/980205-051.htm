I asked a little while about the possibilities owning a 928 after years of
British cars and considerable experience in the repair business (Chrysler).
 Well, I have come across a 1979 Euro? 928 with 46K for $6000.  The car is
2 hours from my home.  It was purchased at a salvage auction with some
vandalism damage to the left side.  It has been described to me as having
quite a few small dents, easily repaired by a "dent wizard"  (paintless
dent repair usually about $60 per accessible dent) and one larger dent at
the left rear quarter.  Broken windshield, cracked dash (common?)  and some
minor scraping on the right rear quarter (no dent).  There is a clear
title.  I can do minor body work and I painted both my Triumphs.  Service
records are probably not available.. What do you folks think?  I appreciate
your advice.  Thanks.  Barry
