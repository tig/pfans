I was in a somewhat similar dilemma about 2 1/2 years ago
when I bought my 928S4. However, I will not give you my
opinion on the performance or other technicalities of either
car (I am sure others in the list will jump at this chance...).
May it suffice to say that I am very satisfied with my decision
(for the Porsche) and would do it all over again the same
way, if faced with the situation again. I don't think that you
could get a more complete balance of desirable charac-
teristics, for your money. But most importantly, the other two
cars cannot (and hardly any other car in the price range)
match the refinement and, above all, CLASS of the 928!!

On the other hand, let me talk in more tangible terms.
When I requested quotations from different INSURANCE
companies for different cars, I was nicely surprised to find
that insuring a 928 was significantly cheaper than most other
"high-performance" cars (does anybody know why?
 - if this is a subject already dealt with in this list, perhaps
an answer directly to me would be better), including the
ZX300 TT, 3000GT VR4, and even the Mustang GT (which of
course is arguably not in the same league as the rest). For
these cars, the quote assuming perfect driving record
ranged anywhere from $200 to $300 per month (!!). I can
happily tell you that right now, my insurance is $72 a month,
and that includes my Texas-mandatory  ;-) 1997 F150 PU truck.


>(aside from one-line replies saying "just get the 928 dude, it's
>cooler!")

Which is obviously true too!

Good luck with you decision, whichever this might be...
