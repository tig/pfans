Ed Thanks for that bit of info. I thought for sure my 86S had been mis-wired
(my passenger side power window selector is set to go up on the down
button). I kept wondering why my turn signal light stays on.
One time I had to fly from Burbank Airport to San Francisco to work on a
clients system. I left the car parked in extended parking for a week. It
seems I left the indicator light (turn signal) engaged. When I got back
VIOLA! dead battery. I got a jump from the parking attendant. I find this
feature annoying. I have to constantly check my car to see that the signal
is shutoff. (my 86S does not automatically disengage the turn signal all the
time, due to wear, so this creates a problem) I have left the signal on for
8 or more hours and have not had battery problem.

THis is a valuable piece of info
