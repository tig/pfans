Eric is right.  I switch my non oil leaking 928 to synthetics and guess
what, your right, I now have an oil leak.  Its not bad, more of an
embarassment.  It smokes for a while after sitting until it burns the
oil off the manifold, and this scares me.  I have had a fire on my home
(boat) and I do not want another in my shark.  My questions are, I have
already switched back to dino oil, do you guys think it will stop the
leak?   On my first investigation, the oil seams to be coming from the
cam seal.  Do I have to pull the cam all the way out or just the bearing
carrier?  The PO had the water pump and timing belt replaced about 7000
miles ago and the service report said it needs "washer and bushing on
both cams and oil gear".  This is why I suspect the seals.  I need to
determine if I can do the work, I do not think I want to pull the cam,
but the bearing carrier I think I can do.  So I will ask my in detail
questions after determining that.
