In pursuit of getting it right I have found confusion concerning the
928GT. Porsche Chronicle says it was the manual version of the car
formerly known as the S4 in the '89 model year. The book says the S4
designation was dropped in the '90 model year and the GT appellation
(appellation Porsche controle for wine buffs?) applied in the '91 model
year.

Alternative sources say the 928GT was introduced in 1989 - I don't know
the model year.

Was there a difference between 928GT introduction between the USA and
the rest of the world?

Was there only one 928GT or two different ones; one for the USA and the
other for everywhere else?

Thank you in advance to any light caster.

Regards ... Chris
