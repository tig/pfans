The difference in clutch feel come from its design.  The 85 and 86
car have a dual disk clutch.   The 87 have a single disk clutch which
is less complicated mechanically but makes the clutch harder to actuate.

The shifting should be the same for 85 on car as they are all the
same Borg-Wagner design.
