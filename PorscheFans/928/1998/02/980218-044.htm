	What is a JATO, well if you have a big airplane and the runway is to 
short to take off, you strap on a couple jato's. Jet assist takeoff, more 
like a rocket, solid fuel (I think).  Inrecdible power, not very big.  
There is a urban legand, great story wish it were true, about a chevy 
Impala.  If you got it up to 100 then lit the JATO WOW! Well if the jato 
didn't just rip off the car!  Rocket engines are not very big, but make 
lots of power and noise!  What was that little german plane ME 163?  Pure 
hydragen peroxide and T stuff or something, lots of accidents with those, 
wild stuff.  You really wanted to run it out of fuel, if it turned over 
on landing it might explode!



	Does anybody really have a job?   I thought there was no original 
connection to the shark, thought it was a old story handed down from the 
generations, long forgotten and clearly distorted.  I thought part of it 
was something about staying in a group for survial and attacking lesser 
creatures at will.



	TED HEINRITZ  ENGINEER (US NAVY) Are we safe now? Only if they don't ask 
for a tech assist!  Not now, didn't they say it is unsafe to travel 
now........
