Bob,
I advise against the OEM Porsche cover, it will scratch your paint. This is
the only occasion that you will ever hear me say not to use anything
Porsche, but the car cover is sub-standard.

I keep my Black 89 S4 in the garage and use a very, very soft Grey Cotton
Flannel cover. I did a lot of research and found California Car Cover Co. to
make the softest and most cost-effective cover on the market. Plus they were
one of the only cover makers to offer the Cotton Flannel in grey instead of
tan (allergic to earth tones) It is treated with Dupont Water repellant and
could be used in a light rain if necessary.

The cost was around $139 plus shipping and it was made to order and arrived
in 7-8 days. The fit was perfect and even better than the OEM Porsche cover.
