This is a reflection on society. When your car was built, it was common
practice to drive with the doors unlocked (so that someone could open the
door and drag you out of the upside-down burning wreck).

These days (where you live anyway), the doors are locked while driving.

Even notwithstanding the two Dobermanns that accompany me in my 928, I
still drive with doors unlocked. Muggings and car-jackings just don't
happen where I live. I also sometimes leave the car unlocked with the key
in it at night, and leave the doors to my house open overnight as well.

Some of my neighbours don't even _know_ where the key is to lock their
houses up.

Paradise, you think? Not at the price we pay for 928's and petrol! :^)
