Another similarity would be in the craftsmanship of the watch, and the 928, as
opposed to the bland nothingness of lesser items.

Today I was reading 'The Unconscious Civilization' by John Ralston Saul.  It is
a marvellous critique of corporatist society, and I heartily recommend reading
it.  After reading the following passage, I spent a few moments pondering why I
drove, and will drive again, a 928.

    "It isn't surprising in such an atmosphere of professional conformism that
we should seek release in what I would call false individualism.  It could also
be called superficial self satisfaction.  The problem is that not looking
looking after our personal desires is innately wrong.  Clothes, holidays,
sports, multiple marriages and orgasms, face and other lifts can be agreeable
diversions on life's tiring road.  Why shouldn't we divert ourselves?  The
problem is that these agreeable moments are increasingly identified as the
expression of individualism.  As individualism itself."

For me it's the vitality of the experience of piloting a shark.  The feeling of
communication between my being, and the road surface beneath me.  Funnily, this
was one of the repeated criticisms levelled at the 928 by the motoring press,
who wanted some more cotton wool.  Give me communication or give me death.  Well
almost.

And that's what it's all about.
