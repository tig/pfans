Tamers,

I have an 85S with a beautiful dark blue leather interior that has, over 
time, begun to crack and tear. I heard of a place that sells leather 
covers for the 928 specifically (Worlduph.com 18002229577). I wonder of 
anyone has had experience with this place, and what their opinion is. 
They want $800 for the seatcovers of the two front seats; of course, 
needless to say, it's a do-it-yourslef venture from there. My local  
funloving upholstery people want to earn themselves $4,000 for redoing 
my interior (seats only)- some even wanted that amount for re-doing it 
in vinyl! it is amazing the way some people's eyes fill up with dollar 
signs once they see a Porsche. If anyone knows of a fair place in Miami, 
please inform me. 
BTW: Thank you all for your replies to "a mule of one's own." Although I 
wish I could get what a few of you suggested (another 928), my budget 
wont be able to stretch that much until after law school- then I'll get 
a Boxster and have it mule for the shark- haha! I'm trying to pressure 
my mom into selling me the Chevette (the 'vette), but I'm not 
optimistic. In the mean time, I've seen a few 280z cars, but most are in 
bad condition; I've also looked at a Cadillac ElDorado (1988). I have 
yet to decide, but thank you all.

jojo
