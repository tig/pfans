<something is wacked, get it checked asap.
Phil, The front end is fine, stock settings sometimes, autocross 
setup ( more neg. camber & less toe ) other times. I think maybe I
was not clear on describing the "problem". What seems to happen over
very rolling or uneven pavement is that the front suspension "tops"
then "bottems" ie. moves FULL travel. What I'm wondering is if large
toe & or camber changes take place as the suspension cycles through
it's range of travel? This is never a problem on racetracks, (fairly
smooth) but in Michigan some expressway ramps are real nasty. I know
I could pull the springs off & cycle the suspension through it's
travel on a alignment rack & measure the changes, but thats a lot of
work. I'm hoping someone with lots of track use may have already
done this & would have a handle on the problem.
  Car is 85S 5-speed stock. Koni shocks, Yoko A008RSII autocross
tires.
