What shop?  Convertibles we have seen:
Carelli - see p. 100,  Automotion Catalog #17 (just mailed) owned by a
Bill Kelley a member of this list. email "KelleyAd@westworld.com"

one labelled "bb" (don't know what it stands for) looks kind of like a
targa

one is a recent conversion reportedly owned by a sports figure in
Florida?

and another an older conversion. I got this from some web auto lot.


Is yours any of these?
