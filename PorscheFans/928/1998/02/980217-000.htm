Have you ever seen a great personalized plate on the back of a car and
thought "that's great, how did they come up with that saying?"

My hobby over the last eight years has been to collect the best of the
"Vanity Plates" that I have seen, heard of, or thought of myself.  I am
in
the process of editing my list and entering it onto my computer for
publication.  I am looking for ideas and would consider any good Vanity
Plates that you have seen, might own, or might wish you had.  You can
email
your entry to me at d_k_walker@email.msn.com and maybe you will win one
of
the neat prizes I am going to give away for the best of the best! 
Within
the next two to three weeks my 500 BEST VANITY PLATES will be published
on
my web site.  I will make an announcement here when it is available.  If
you
would like me to alert you when my site is up, email me your address.
Within the next month I hope to have my complete list of 10,000+ VANITY
PLATES published and available for those who are looking for lots of
ideas
for their own plate.

Most states allow from two to seven characters and numbers to comprise
the
saying on your plate.  A few allow eight, but I will limit my list to
seven
max.  All states will censor most swear words, vulgar or lewd
connotations,
etc.  I will do the same, so please don't clutter my day with obsene
entries.

My site will also eventually include all the information you need to
apply
for a Vanity Plate in your state, the cost, and even where to get the
form
you need.  DMV sites will be linked where possible.

Join me in the fun - Vanity Plates, or VANITYPL8s, as I call them can
become
a great hobby or game, not just on the road.  Speaking of games, I will
be
publishing a game or two that use the VANITYPL8s as well.  If you have
any
ideas for a game, please submit them as well.  Eventually I will expand
my
site to contain anything VANITYPL8 related that my readers demand,
including
some great merchandise designed around VANITYPL8s.

(I quess I should tell you that my personal VANITYPL8 for the last
several
years has been "IBYTE", as I was in the computer business for a long
time.
My wife and I are Critical Care Nurses and the tag on our Minivan says
"ICURNX2", which gets lots of comments.  Our star ball player son's car
has
"HOMERUN" while our daugter, who taught herself to sign when just a
little
tot, has "ISIGN" on her car.  As you can see, VANITYPL8s can be a family
affair as well as a lot of fun.)

Please go ahead and make your submission now.  All entries will become
the
property of myself so that they might be published.  

<ehh, my plates belong to me thank you - he must mean your actual email
reply/message?  phil>

Thanks,
