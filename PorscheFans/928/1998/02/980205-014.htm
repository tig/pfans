Greetings all,

   I just re-subscribed to the list(been mia since about July of '97),
so I'll mostly be "lurking" while I get back up to speed, but I came
across this bit of news which I thought would be of interest. I picked
it off of the Society of Automotive Engineers website.  It is a bit
long...
  The power and efficiency gains achieved on the 3.8l 911 RSR are
amazing.  Wonder if the same could be done with a 928.  Just think, not
only would we get 26mpg(hwy), but also 395hp...... A dream come true!!
I've requested more info since no details are given regarding this
"pulse charging" technology.

New Pulse Charge Technology Gives 30-50%
Power Increase While Improving Fuel
Efficiency

Burbank, CA -- 01/07/1998 --Due to overwhelming interest in BAT
International's (OTC:BAAT) Dec. 19, 1997 release and reference to a
November 1997 editorial in Automotive Industries, BAT has gotten
permission
to reprint and distribute the entire editorial. 

Jac Nasser, president of Ford Automotive Operations gave a speech to the
auto industry that noted that low price/earning ratios and return on
sales for
Detroit auto manufacturers were the result of lack of inventiveness and
new
technology to remain competitive. He was paraphrased as saying that "he
was
advocating a new world order where suppliers come forward with new, wild
ideas, things that have never been tried, and the automakers listen." 

BAT is prepared to offer new ideas to major auto companies through
licensing
and other agreements, and we certainly believe they may listen.
Invitations have
been sent out to auto companies and suppliers to attend a
super-efficient
vehicle test run on Jan. 15 at the new Penske California Speedway in
Fontana,
Calif. 

The run will demonstrate the fuel efficiency of a newly completed super-
efficient engine in a four- door Geo Metro. We are anticipating reaching
at least
80 miles per gallon at 60 mph as a result of Dolphin's proprietary Pulse
Charge
technology. The engine technology can easily be incorporated in current
generation engines with little tooling investment and little or no
increase in engine
cost. 

Numerous parties have volunteered to participate in driving vehicles and
certifying vehicle fuel efficiency. Roger Ward, two time Indianapolis
500
winner, will be one of the drivers. Other drivers include Gene Kosmono,
who is
a nationally recognized race car driver and set four track records in
one night at
a major race track, and Keith Harper, test driver for the General Motors
Test
Facility. Other certifying entities including universities and state
agencies are
considering participation. 

BAT and Dolphin will also be showcasing a high-power engine in a Magnum
sports car (Dolphin owns Magnum Car Co., which was formerly owned by
Sumitomo). The same technology that provides high efficiency can also
provide
very high power. Recent informal road tests of a Pulse Charged 2.3 liter
4
cylinder Type IV Porsche 914 engine in a Magnum resulted in acceleration
of 0
to 60 miles per hour in only 4.2 seconds. This is faster than some of
the finest
sports cars including Lamborghini and Ferrari that use very expensive 12
cylinder engines. 

Dolphin has tested Pulse Charge technology in approximately 20 different
race
car engines. Power improvements of 30-50% have been achieved as a result
of
Dolphin Pulse Charge technology. The most surprising result is that
Dolphin
Pulse Charging can improve both power and fuel efficiency. 

In one recent test by an independent racing group, a Dolphin Pulse
Charged
Porsche 3.8 L 911 RSR Race Engine was able to achieve both a 25%
improvement in power and 30% improvement in fuel efficiency in dyno
testing. 

BAT's is planning to license a whole array of engine technologies to
major auto
manufacturers immediately after the demonstration run in January. The
ability to
provide engine technology that can be both very high power and very high
fuel
efficiency and does not increase cost will be very important in these
license
discussions. BAT is also discussing with several overseas companies
possible
joint ventures to enter into production of both super-efficient and
high-power
engines and vehicles.
