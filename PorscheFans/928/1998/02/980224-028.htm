  I drove an S4 for the first time a few weeks ago.  There was a vast 
  improvement in the feel and ease of going through the gears in the S4
  over my '83, but FWIW, my mechanic says that my car is showing signs
  of the infamous synchro wear.  What surprised me was that the clutch
  was much heavier in the S4 vs. the S.
  
  I also drove my mechanic's '85 a while back.  Going through the gears
  in his car was as nice as the S4, but the clutch didn't feel as heavy.
