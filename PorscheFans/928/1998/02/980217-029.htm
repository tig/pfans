Does anyone have a US spec 85 32v without ABS? I'd like to know if the 
ABS relay is fitted in your car. I have the relay (and fuse) but can't 
figure out why its there. The relay is energized with the ignition off  
(presumably with it on as well) and seems to do nothing that I can figure 
out other than draw some current. I need to look over the schematics I 
guess but it would be nice to know if I should pull it or not. Anyone 
know what the total parasitic current draw should be. I imagine it varies 
a bit from year to year with later cars pulling more. Mine is about 100mA 
and close to 250 with the ABS relay. 250mA is too much I would say. I 
didn't spend a lot of time trying to see where its going (it was toooooo 
cold last weekend) but I did pull each fuse in turn with no effect and 
its not the radio because its not in the car right now. The clock was 
active but 100mA is an awful lot for a clock with an LCD display. I'll 
check it further this weekend unless someone tells me 100mA is normal.

Thanks

Colin
