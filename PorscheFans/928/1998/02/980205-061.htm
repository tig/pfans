Hi all,

	Will all of the recent storms in Southern California, I have found out
that my beloved car seems to have sprung a leak.  Being one of the
"silent" members of the list, I read about clearing the drains in the
sunroof with either compressed air, or trying bicycle brake cables.  I
have used the latter, being careful not to force the cable as I threaded
it down both the driver's and passenger's side drains (2 total) -- roto
rootering the line.  After doing this, I injected about 60 cc's of water
down the drain and watched in run out on my garage floor.  I was quite
proud of myself and felt like I had solved the problem.  Well, today I
got into my car and smelled that sort of damp smell.  Sure enough, the
problem was back.  What I have noticed is that the passenger side gets
damp along the floor.  I have only noticed this when I pull up the floor
matts.  The drivers side is just fine.  I have also noticed that I may
get a drop of water on my finger from under the headliner when I feel
just above it while sitting in the car.  Anyway, the question of the day
is -- Any ideas?

	The other question I have is this:  Could someone please give me a
number, or location where I can purchace Redline Oil (spacifically
manual transmission oil.)  I am planning on doing a change in the near
future (ie.  as soon as I get the oil.)  Thanks for your help
