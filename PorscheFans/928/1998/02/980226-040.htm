	I was not aware of this.  You can find original bosh O2 sensors at
	AutoZone but they might have a different connector.  If it is
	possible, could you compare your sensor to the Bosh universal
	sensor (just by visual inspection)?  I would expect all Bosh sensor
	to be pretty much the same but I have been wrong before...

	PT said that some O2 sensors have a higher "resolution".  This, I interpret as
just being more sensitive; outputting more voltage variation given a certain amount of
time.  "Cross-checking" is probably a better word.  Depending on the particular EFI system
in use, the brain relies on this frequency to make the necessary adjustment.  It would not
be unreasonable for me to say that that is why some people feel a degradation in
performance and/or driveability problems because they could have a perfectly new O2 sensor
(but not OEM) on their vehicle.  The brain is programmed to behave a certain way given the
lattitude and performance of all emission sensors in the vehicle.  When you introduce a
component that is not within spec, the brain gets thrown off; e.g. CHECK ENGINE light will
lit.  This is much more critical on newer EFI system.
