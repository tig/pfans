Actually, I think all of us guys have it all wrong.  About sharkers who are
of the female persuasion.

While we like to mouth off about our cars (and other stuff too, actually),
there likely are MANY ladies who appreciate and even love their 928s (or
ours!), but who sit quietly on the sidelines, reading the gibberish of us
males, and snicker.

My experience is that when we most want to get them to make some sort of
input, they won't.  A lot of time, even when we goad them and goad them.
Sort of like a roiling sea that crashes and crashes on the rocks.  Takes a
Loooooong time to wear 'em down.
