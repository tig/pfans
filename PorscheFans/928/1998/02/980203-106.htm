It has been about a month since I put my car back together (86 928s 5spd).  I
did a t belt water pump, paint intake runners, changed all rubber hoses and
vac lines. Cleaned injectors.  My baby has been running awesome!   Until
today.....

I was on my way to lunch with a co worker.  ran it up and down the gears
passenger was very impressed until all the dash lights turned on, no volts. I
pulled to a stop and heard a jingling.

I popped open the hood and reache for the alternator belt, it was loose, as
well as the MAIN pulley.  The main bolt ( my friend called it the "jesus" bolt
from his days as a helicopter mech, they called the bolt that held the helo
rotors this).  Luckily the belly pan caught the bolt and we were able to fix
it instead of eating lunch.

The spec book calls for some 295 NM or torque.  I thought I got it tight,
maybe the spirited driving loosened it?  Im taking the car out of service
until I can get my torque wrench calibrated and let my skinny but try and give
it the torque it needs.

I am really lucky the t belt sprocket didnt do anything crazy!
