Someone from the 944 list passed on this link to an article the
NY Times did recently on Porsche:

http://www.nytimes.com/library/auto/980213cars.html

For the of you who don't care to access the whole article, the
only mention of 928s follows:

     The 928, of 1978-92, had a powerful V8 engine up front. The
     car never caught on with the public or with Porsche owners.

     "The 928 is a touring car made by a sports car company,"
     said John Draneas, president of the Oregon region of the
     Porsche Club of America. "It's a fine car, as long as someone
     else is driving it and not me."

Of course, to put the article in perspective, check out this quote:

    The Boxster roadster, introduced last year, maintains the air-
    cooled, rear-engine formula.

Just in case there's anyone else on the planet besides the author
who doesn't know - the Boxster is WATER-cooler and MID-engine.

Bill Coleman (Happy to be a "someone else" driving a 928)
