Hello all,
There were some posts regarding inoperative headlights, and I haven't seen the
original poster's reply as to whether it's fixed or not. It was mentioned that
it could be the headlight relay, fuses, or just burned-out bulbs. (I believe
switch was confirmed ok) I may be off base here, but could it be a problem
with the headlight brights / turn signal switch? I recently had trouble with
mine not going to high beam when I flicked the lever forward. Flicking it a
few times would usually make them work though.  (the high beam flash when
pulling the lever back worked fine) So, easy enough, bad contacts in the
bright switch. I took mine out and squirted it with contact cleaner inside and
although the switch can't be disassembled, I could see with a flashlight which
contacts needed to be made in each switch position and confirmed this with a
meter. I took a jewlers screwdriver and tweeked the offending contact to fix
the problem. Just wondering if there could be a bad connection to this switch
or inside that would cause inoperative headlights altogether, as apparently
the headlight wiring has to go thru this also.
