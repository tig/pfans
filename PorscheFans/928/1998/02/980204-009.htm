Several people have posted gasoline experiences and thought I'd relate
some of my experience while working with refineries in the Southwest.
My job at that time connected me with a variety of process and
production engineers at various companies (most were major brands, but a
few were independent refiners selling to distributors who in turn sell
gasoline to the corner quick-trip market).   Because of my gear-head
nature, I asked questions about additives, marketing claims, pricing,
performance, etc.

It became clear to me that most companies produce high-quality
product.   The blend of additives and ability of the marketing
department to create a perception of uniqueness are the key
differences.   Different combinations of additives, combined with
specific engine design, complicated by the relative tuning of that
engine, account for varying results.

More interesting is how much influence the distributor and local gas
station have on quality.   Like all business, there are unscrupulous
operators that sell 'regular' grade gas to the retailer as 'premium' to
make a quick profit.   Yes, it's fraud.   Sometimes, honest mistakes are
made when the truck driver fills the wrong underground tank - have you
ever seen a pump truck transferring fuel from one underground tank to
another at a gas station?   I was regaled on countless stories (because
the refiner is frequently blamed for poor quality) where it turned out
water runoff at the retail gas station poured into opened storage tanks
(lid not sealed), where a cracked underground storage tank let vast
amounts of water mix with the gas, where the retailer for the major
brand actually bought cheap low-octane gasoline from an independent
distributor to fill his/her 'premium' tanks for obvious greedy reasons
(there was a detailed 20/20 report on this a couple of years ago
investigating several Southern California Chevron stations and their
owners).  Well, you get the picture.

I've personally had pretty good experience with all brands all over the
country.   IMHO, it isn't realistic to judge a specific brand of gas as
good or bad for our cars.   As with about everything else, find what you
and your shark like best and stick with it.

One last note:   anyone else find it humorous that Amoco promotes it's
premium 'clear' as better for your engine?   Funny how they imply it can
'clean' and engine because the raw gas is 'clear'?   I still chuckle at
that one........
