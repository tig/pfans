Hi folks,
  New to the list, learning to spell Porsche! I've been looking casually
for about 4 months, seriously the past month. Here's my dream shark:

  1987+ S4, 'mirror' black w/tan supple leather, auto, after market
BBS with gold center, no blems, one owner, all books. (Similiar to the
one Lucky Ekman had in Feb 1998 Excellence, but he didn't return my
calls). 

  I'll take a different color or trans, but it has to stand out. Doesn't
need to be stock, I just like the car. I'm willing to redo a car,
but I prefer to take advantage of the fact that you only get
satisfaction
out of upgrades (rather than value). Not interested in engine upgrades,
yet...

  If you've gotten this far, perhaps you'd be kind enough to answer
a few questions..

  1. I'm in San Diego, can anyone recommend a 928 mechanic?
  2. Does anyone have experience changing the paint color? (How
     much extra work does it involve with interior/engine)
  3. I'm told a full leather job is 3-4K? Is this about right?
  4. I can't accept broken accessories or unsightly interior pieces,
     what's the market like for 'clean' replacements?

Please respond direct if you don't have 'group' interest. See
you on the list when I get what I want.
