Dave Hammond asked about Walter Miller.

Walter has a shop in Syracuse NY that he says will eventually become an
auto museum.  It is really an interesting place to visit, with stacks
and stacks of auto literature from all marques scattered about. He has a
number of old vehicles in various states of repair, including a car that
has the front halves of two US cars (I forget which models) welded
back-to-back,forming an automotive "Pushmepullyou" parked in front.

I visited his place while on a trip to Syracuse several years ago. My
son wanted a specific piece of literature for his '68 911L, and while I
was there I picked up the sales brochure for the '85 928S.

If you are ever in Central NY I strongly recommend a visit to Walter's
shop.  He's located on the northeast side of Syracuse, just north of the
Thruway (I-90, for those not familiar with NYS colloquialisms).
