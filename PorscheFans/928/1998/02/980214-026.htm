Doug,

Where is this car located? There is a Red/Black '89 GT here in Austin that was
recommended by one of the mechanics who works on the car as one to stay away
from...

The car looks ok, but nothing to write home about, especially since it has
only 56k miles on.  My car has 20k more than that and looks better and drives
better...

Good luck,
James

PS.  I guess if you could get the GT in Austin for about $17k it might be
alright, just remember this one has been ridden hard and put up wet on many
occasions, as well as having been pretty heavily wrecked.
