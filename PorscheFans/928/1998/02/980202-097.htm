Matt,

Below follows the original post from Louis Ott.  I had saved this
because I thought it might come in handy.  I hope this helps.

>>Hi,
>>I have had the non or part time odometer problem on two or three VDO
>>instrumented cars, Audi, VW & MB I think. Probably because I only drive older
>>cars. My problem was a plastic (nylon?) gear, about 1/2 inch in diameter, that
>>is pressed on the shaft that turns the odometer cylinders. Over time and
>>baking in the sun, the gear shrinks and develops a small crack at the hub. The
>>gear then slips on the shaft instead of turning it. This was on VDO units
>>driven by a speedometer cable. I don't know how the electronic
>>speedometer/odometer units operate. The odometer part may be similar. You've
>>got to take it out anyway so have a look.
>>
>>The solution I used was to clean the gear and shaft with degreasing solvent.
>>It's tough due to limited space. Use a foam Q tip like you would use for tape
>>head cleaning. I mixed a small amount of JB Weld epoxy and carefully applied
>>it to the gear hub/shaft end. Don't let the JB Weld sag into the works! Let it
>>cure and re-assemble. I never had any more odometer problems after the fix.  I
>>would suggest also cleaning and lubricating the odometer unit to be sure it
>>wasn't  stuck together with old grease.
>>
>>It's really not to difficult to remove the pod to get the speedo out. Get a 27
>>mm socket,  4" extension, and long handle to remove the steering wheel, a long
>>5 mm allen wrench to undo 2 bolts (nearly hidden, near front outer edges of
>>the pod - underneath), and an 8 or 10 mm socket to undo 2 more bolts near the
>>turn signal switch unit and the pod is nearly free. This is after taking off
>>the shield under the pod held on with 2 phillips headed screws, and the turn
>>signal/light switch assembly. Careful to not pull the wires loose that go to
>>the instrument light dimmer and intermittent wiper delay control. Remove the
>>elecrtical plugs that go to the instrument cluster and work it free of the pod
>>starting from the right side (for left drive cars).
>>
>>Hope this helps.
