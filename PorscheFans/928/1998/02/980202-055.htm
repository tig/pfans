Uh, oh!  Now we have a problem, as I love 928s and I'm an artist in several
areas.  Oops!  I'm also a private pilot (and wished to have been military)
as well as a mechanical designer of things for myself here and technically
oriented.  Well, I have to say that I think 911s are nice too, but the 928
has been my fave for a long time.  Which category does that put me in?
