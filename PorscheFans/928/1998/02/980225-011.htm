"Well: it happened to me!  I was stuck in freeway traffic, when my
temperature
guage rose ........"

Bummer!

"Now I am told, that my $70,000 Porsche, will require at least $10,000
of repair."

That would be the price of a shop rebuild, and is accurate.

" What should I do? "

Call Mark at 928 International and get the quote for a used engine.
There are quite a few other choices depending on your location (to cut
down on shipping charges), but I've certainly gotten great service from
928 Int'l.

"Throw it away-----or trade it in on a TOYOTA?"

I think you should definintely throw it away.......give me your phone
number and I'll  come by and pick it up....FOR FREE!

"Thanks for any information."

Please keep us informed.   After you see you can get a 'new' engine for
a few thousand, you might post for some assistance if you want to tackle
the job yourself.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be more than
happy to help swap - and there are likely several sharkers in your area
that may be able to assist.

Good luck!
