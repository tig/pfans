That's what it is.

Tourist delivery used to be a big thing over here in New Zealand. Importing
fully built-up cars incurred a HEAVY tax (in a valiant attempt to protect
our "local" car industry - which comprised of people putting together
components bought in from overseas with a small amount of local content -
wiring loom, seats, battery).

A tourist delivery comprised of someone flying over to Europe (usually the
UK, to get a RHD specimen), driving it around on holiday for the
prerequisite time to get the reduction in import duty, then bunging it in a
container and shipping it home.
