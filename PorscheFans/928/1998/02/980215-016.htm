Howard: 
I'm near Chico, way north so don't know of A-1. Being me, I'd park it and
wait for Devek unless A-1 comes with rave reviews on 928's. Susan might
know of A-1, or any of the SF area people like Phil Tong would surely come
up with an alternative if DEVEK is busy and you need the car. Did Susan
know of the situation? Please let me know if there was or was not water
damage. Good luck with it!
