To the flurry of cooling fan posts, I'll add one more:
With my 944, when I changed from the original thermostat to the updated
one that triggered the fan on at a lower temp., the draw on the 944's
engine was enough to usually be noticed. On my S4, I'm seldom aware of
the cooling fan coming on, I think because there are so many more ponies
prancing around under the hood, that the draw is less noticeable. But
for either engine,  running cooler has got to be better. I've
encountered many engine bay components made brittle from the heat.
It is my intention to switch to the lower-triggering thermostat for the
928 also. Water-cooling is probably not Porsche's strong suit, and both
the 944 and 928 will presumably run healthier at slightly lower temps.
That's my $9.28.
BTW, I'm looking for a mechanic on the San Francisco peninsula. Devek
sounds pretty heavily booked. I've been given the name of one other
garage, A-1, does anyone on the list have any other local
recommendations? Any feedback on Heyer Performance in Mountain View?
Phil, can I bring my car to you?

Thanks in advance.
