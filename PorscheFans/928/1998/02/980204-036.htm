recently who had Falkens on her '80 928 and was so unhappy with the road
noise she "turned them in" for some Michelins, which are much better.
She said she felt like she was driving a truck.  Luckily the place she
bought them from was willing to exchange them for full credit.>

Folks,

I have the Falken Ziex 502's on my 88S4.   I have found them to be quite 
good.  They are much quieter than the Goodyears that were on it and I find 
the tire characteristics are quite good overall.    I have driven this car 
at Willow springs with both the Falken's and the BFG R1's and the lap times 
of each follow.

1:42 Falkens
1:40:22 R1's

Falken tread wear rating is 300 utog.  This is more than twice the rating 
of other Z rated tires.

I personally did not like the R1's feel.  Due to the built in camber that 
BFG incorporated, the tire caused relative instability under braking and 
the turn in was quite abrupt.  The adhesion at breakaway was superior to 
the Falken but not at all predicable.

The Falken tire does not exhibit any strange handling characteristics. 
 Very stable under braking, turn in is a touch sluggish, however, breakaway 
is very stable and linear.  These tires would allow the car to be driven in 
a four wheel drift with throttle steer.  The R1's could not be driven this 
way.

Therefore, in my opinion, the Falkens are a very good tire for the 928, 
particularly at the price.   I know that there are many other great tires 
out there IE: SO2's etc.  But they cost a lot more than the 502's.

Of, course, the above is just my humble opinion.  Others may disagree and 
be totally correct.
