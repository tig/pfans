Greetings all:

Can't remember who started this thread but some new info has surfaced,
so thought it should be passed along, FWIW.

The following is courtesy of a Loctite engineer and 911 racer:

The bimetallic seizing problem likely stems from moisture trapped
by the Loctite rather than a chemical reaction to the Loctite.  

The proper fix doesn't involve any thread-locker at all.  We should
simply delete the gasket, use their hi-temp red RTV gasket maker
instead.  The spring washers on the bolts are then sufficient to keep
the proper torque.  

Apparently all the car companies have eliminated cork pan gaskets,
Porsche included, in favor of this technique.  Says the loosening
problem is because the cork gasket shrinks over time. 

Interestingly, he also said that because we have rigid pans attached to
rigid blocks, we don't need any anti-vibration thread-locker on the pan
bolts.  The stamped steel pans used in some cars do transmit vibration
to such an extent that thread-locking is needed.

Lastly, a caveat regarding assembly without a pan gasket...due to the
thickness of the Porsche pan gasket, the bolts may bottom out before
properly compressing the RTV.  I've already put mine back on, _with_
gasket, so I can't test...but I'll bet it's a problem.  

BTW, note that 5 of the bolts are shorter than the others. See the 4
stepped down holes on the sides and the one with a tight vertical
cleareance at the right front (motor upside down on the stand).  The
stepped down hole at the back is not blind, uses the regular bolt.

For the record, I used Loctite red gasket sealer on both sides of the
cork gasket and nothing on the bolts, resigning myself to periodic
tightening.  If I were more skilled with a wire twister and had the
patience, Leonard's approach is clearly the fail safe one.
