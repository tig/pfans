Hey Bill,

Any info on weatherstripping makers would be great.  Ken Kasik recommended
JC Penny's - I mean Whitney's - and I'll check them out too.  I've already
tried Trim Lock in Orange County and Tamrazs in Illinois.

As indicated in my original post - no door jamb plaque to give me any clues.
 The top and body panels are all custom made for the car - did not use an
existing Mercedes or Mazaratti soft top - the top is a true wet-weather
defender - well proven during revent encounters with El nino.

Does your convertible have a 'build plate' on the door jamb above the
striker? If it says 'Carelli', you have the only series convertible
conversion that was done correctly.

There is one other I know of, a metallic blue '79 that was built by Gene
Winfield. He used all Mercedes 450 SL components for his top, though, so
that would make the solution trivial for any upholstery shop.

Mine has a simpler top that uses a canvas bead to 'shield' the edge of the
window and the glass just rests against a flap of canvas. Definitely a fair
weather top.

I have a catalog of weatherstripping somewhere around here, and I can dig
up the name & phone number so you can get one, too. Alternatively, Hemmings
has at least 3 manufacturers/dealers who will undoubtedly have whatever you
want.
