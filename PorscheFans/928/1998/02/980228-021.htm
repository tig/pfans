Hi Guys,

Various things this time:

Firstly, oil consumption - Thanks to the people who replied to my query 
a few weeks ago.  I got the main dealers to check the car over and 
fortunately I don't have any leaks.  Apparently the car is specced at 
consuming 1.5 litres per 600 miles, so my two litres in a thousand miles 
is fine.  Actually I put the car through one of Porsche's 74 point 
checks.  The only thing they found was a benign weeping diff oil seal 
(hence the oily transaxle), and front pads which need replacing in 2 or 
3 thousand miles, not bad for a 74K mile 7 year old supercar - I wonder 
how many Ferrari owners could say the same?  Brian?

Next, a recommendation to UK owners.  Just had my kid's seat recovered 
in leather by Southbound Motor Trimmers in Stockbridge.  They did a 
brilliant job and the recovered seats I saw there all looked like brand 
new Porsche originals.  Get your old seats done now for £500/pair, 
before they wise up and start charging piss-taking prices like most 
other Porsche suppliers this side of the pond.

Next, if anyone's hungry for S4 pictures - I just posted photos of my 
car on my site:

Finally, the RDK tyre pressure system bridge - I got a friend of mine to 
bridge pins 2 and 13 for me and hey presto, I no longer have the 
irritating LED display coming up every ten minutes.

However, I now have the little red tyre pressure warning light top right 
of the dashboard glowing continually, this light never came on before.  
I remember someone else posting this problem - is there a way of turning 
this off, short of dismantling the entire binnacle to get the bulb out?  
If this is the only way, any tips on doing so would be gratefully 
received.  I disconnected the battery for a minute or so but that didn't 
work.

Anyone?

Dan
