If you look at all those relays (does any other car have so many?) you 
will see that most of them are a cube shape. These relays are not close 
to $100. The real costly ones are those big ones that have timers etc 
built into them and they would not be found at an electronic supply store 
unfortunately. I couldn't agree more with the concept though. Common 
electrical parts that can be sourced from an industrial supplier will 
tend to be less expensive. Especially if you can find what you need at a 
surplus kind of emporium. By the way, I wonder what the current rating of 
the contacts in those "cubes" is? I bet its at least 30A and perhaps as 
much as 50! Have you checked out the price of a decent relay that handles 
that kind of current lately.
