The tool does not measure torque.  It does not twist the belt
in any way but measure how thight it is.  It look something like
this:

         O
==================
    O          O

One of the 3 roller (O) is lifted to a predetermined position.  The
central roller is spring loaded.  Once you reach the position, you 
release the tool and you look how much the central roller actually
moved.

There was a noname tool advertised last november in Excellence for
<$200.  We tried to get info on someone that bought one but
never found one (even on the 944 list).

Just find it too bad that Porsche did not copy Honda belts.  There is
a  spring on the engine that take the belt to the proper tension.  
You thighen the pulley and you are done.  I guess it was too simple
a device for such a long belt.  Maybe they should have put 2.
