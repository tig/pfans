Hi,

In your recent post you referred to Nikasil cylinders.

They were first used on the type 917 flat 12 engine in 1971. At that time, the
911E and 911S used Biral cylinders of which the cast iron liner had the
aluminum fins cast around it. This resulted in relatively thick walls. With
the development of the 2.7 RS motor (MY1973), those walls were too thick to
allow for the 90mm pistons needed. The factory used the Nikasil (nickel-
silicon-carbide) cylinders. These are finned aluminum cylinders with the
Nikasil layer electrolytically deposited in the bore. The carbide and silicon
provide the excellent low wear and low friction surfaces. It also allowed for
thinner cylinder walls. In later development, they were used for the 95mm
requirements of the 3.0. They have been used in various 911's since.

What I gather from "Project 928" and other books, is the 928 block is cast
using an aluminim alloy with about 17% silicon. After honing the cylinder
bores, the cylinder walls are etched to expose the silicon, providing a long
wearing surface. The pistons are iron coated on their contact surface to help
increase wear life.

Different process, but similiar results.

All of this because aluminum doesn't wear well against aluminum.

As an aside. The factory also tried running bare aluminum cylinders with iron
coated aluminum pistons, a la Chevrolet powered McLaren race cars and the
lowly Chevy Vega. This was done around the same time. They were called Alusil.
They were cheaper than the Nikasil and were also used in various 911 flavors.


The above is subject to change based upon better info provided by the
subscribers.

Hope that helps,
