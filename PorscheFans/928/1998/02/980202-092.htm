I've always wondered why the blasted engine control computer in modern 
cars doesn't have a gauge on the dash informing the driver how much the 
engine likes or dislikes the gas its being fed. You just *know* that 
computer is making adjustments for the gas and isn't telling you.

Wouldn't it be awful if people knew straight from the horse's mouth if 
their car liked one brand of gas over another?

Bill Clinton thinks he has it bad now, but that's nothing compared to 
the ruckus that would ensue if people had a gauge that suddenly dropped 
when the government mandated poor gas.
