Hi,
I noticed the thread on auto trans shift points. Since I have the same
*problem* with my 928, I thought I'd try to find out some more about it.

I checked my US 86.5 928S auto shift speeds on my way to work today. I believe
my transmission type to be 28.07, but have not physically checked.

Here are my observations and conclusion.

The 1 -2 shift speed was about 44 mph (5300). I tried it 3 times and the shift
speed was 46 the first time, 44 the second time, and 42 the 3rd time. Maybe
the change was due to the fluid heating, but I don't really know. The 2 - 3
shift was constant at about 79 mph (6100) all three times. I tried this test
after I had driven about 45 minutes at 65 to 80 mph so everything should have
been warmed and temps. stable.

The factory repair manual, page 38 - 105 gives these shift speed specs.

The 1 - 2 upshift should occur between 58 and 64 kph, or about 36 to 40 mph.
The 2 - 3 upshift should occur between 109 to 124 kph or about 68 to 77 mph.

It appears that my shift points are a little higher than factory spec. which
is fine with me. I have checked the accuracy of the speedometer and it is very
close. It is within 1 mph at 70 mph. I don't know about the tach accuracy.

I checked my RPM/MPH relationship in 1st and 2nd gear and found that in 1st
gear it is 120 RPM per MPH, while 2nd gear is 77 RPM per MPH. This RPM/MPH
relationship difference corresponds closely with the gear ratio difference
between 1st (3.68) and 2nd (2.41) so it is probably OK. I didn't calculate
overall ratios, tire circumference, etc., since  the numbers are pretty close
and it is the relationship between 1st gear and 2nd gear that is important.
Any tach error will be constant between the gears.

So, taking that information and applying it to the factory spec max speed
shift points, we get the RPM shift point for the 1 - 2 shift at 40 MPH x 120
RPM per MPH = 4800 RPM. The factory spec max RPM for the 2 - 3 shift should be
77 MPH x 77 RPM per MPH = 5929 RPM.

Therefore, we can conclude that it was intended by the Porsche and/or MB
wizards that the 1 - 2 shift should occur at significant less RPM than the 2 -
3 shift. Why? I don't know. I doesn't make sense that it is to protect the
transmission and drive line from a shift at higher RPM since the engine is
actually producing less torque at 6000 RPM than it is at 4800 RPM. It seems to
me that higher RPM shifts would be easier on the transmission,  and CV joints,
etc.

I don't see any connection between the engine computer and the transmission
shift points. The transmission shifts through sensing manifold vacuum,
throttle position, kick down switch position, and the output shaft speed
through a mechanical governor inside the transmission. I can't find an
"electronic control" input to the transmission.

Now, if we can figure out how to raise only the 1 - 2 shift point so it
matches the 2 - 3 shift point.........  ;o)
