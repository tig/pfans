I'm going to give this another shot. I'm the original cat-owning flamee
for imagined inhumane actions during our recent flooding in California.
Well, the flooding only lasted a few hours, the cat spent the time, as
always, napping on the upstairs couches and chasing dust bunnies, and
the only one who received any injuries was me, who got roundly boxed all
around the brainpan by someone in Florida who'd witnessed animal abuse
during Hurricane Andrew. My "wounds" have healed, so I'd like to pass on
a few observations regarding the 928's condition after going axle-deep
in the water. By the way, my thanks to those who sent the flamer
messages regarding the inappropriateness of his actions. That's not what
this list is about, and he totally lacked any knowledge of the
circumstances upon which he nonetheless unilaterally acted as judge,
jury... and executioner.

The 928 had a fair amount of water intrusion, notably on the floorpan at
the rear seats. I took out the carpets and blow-dried a bit on the first
non-rainy day we'd had for awhile. For several more days, there was
heavy condensation on the inside of the windows, but its gradually
subsided. There's also condensate inside both the head and taillight
lens, but I'm convinced there's an inherent design flaw with those, as
I've seen postings lately about that sort of thing after simply washing
the beasts.

The electricals seem to have largely escaped, except that I now get the
brake bulb warning that I've also seen numerous postings about. In my
case, no bulb out, nor any recent replacement. As soon as I first tap
the brake, it goes, and stays, out. All in all, not too troublimg.

There is one symptom I'd like input on: there's a sort of groaning noise
from the left front side of the car. Don't know how to describe it any
better, but I have 2 theories (and no real knowledge.) It's a similar
sound that the driver's door makes opening or closing. Could something
be shifting in there that's a part of the door mechanism? I plan to
lubricate whatever looks lubable, pending input, of course, this
weekend. The less appetizing unfounded theory is a wheel whose bearings
might need repacking? The only other notion I've got seems a long shot:
the PO showed me very minor looking tears in the rear CV boots that I
thought I'd have done when convenient. Well, could my sense of sound be
mislocating CV joints telling me to get off my butt right now? Could the
rapidly moving flood waters have washed away lubricant from inside the
boots? Input welcome...as long as its not disparaging commentary on my
fitness to be a cat owner.
