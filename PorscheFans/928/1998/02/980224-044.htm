Well, I got the car back last Friday (sorry I did not write anything, but I
was driving it).

It ended up costing $ 5,900, which DID cause me significant pain, but the car
feels great. Part of the cost was due to new motor mounts, as well as new
gaskets & seals all around. Of course the belt and associated tensioners, etc.
and the water pump were replaced too.

I love this car and really missed it for the 2.5 weeks it was gone (I was
driving a loaner 97 MB E300 Diesel, which although a great car, can not
compare to a 928). I chose to fix the car because of this and because I now
have a 2 year / 24K mile warranty on the belt and related repairs. 

I will be driving it to South Beach, Florida on Friday night, staying untill
the following Friday. Any one around there?

Nelson
