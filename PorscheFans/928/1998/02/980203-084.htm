Wouldn't it be possible to purchase the mounting hardware from the
dealer and just make a rear cover that is 
remarkably similar to the factory original.  Say the hardware cost
$200(over-estimated guess).  The rest should not cost over $100. 
That would make it feasable to sell through DEVEK or other suppliers. 
Unfortunatly, my car does not have one so I cannot speak from an
educated point of view. 

Anyone have any comments?

(BTW: did you ever notice how many aftermarket parts there are for the
911 and 914 lines?)
