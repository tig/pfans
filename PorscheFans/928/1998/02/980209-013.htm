This is an amusing story, and I thought I'd share it.

>>>From: Richard and Kathy Hutchison <rkhutch@newnorth.net> (by way of
>>> koehnjs@chipfalls.k12.wi.us (Jenifer Koehn))
>>>Subject: revenge
>>>
>>>THIS IS TRUE----PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ IT AND PLEASE SEND THIS TO
>>>EVERY PERSON YOU KNOW WHO HAS AN E-MAIL ADDRESS....THIS IS REALLY TERRIFIC.
>>>
>>>My daughter & I had just finished a salad at  Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas
>>>& decided to have a small dessert.  Because both of us are such cookie
>>>lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie."
>>>
>>> {EDITORIAL COMMENT:
>>>
>>>Neiman's is a VERY EXPENSIVE department store in the States}.
>>>
>>>It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the  recipe and the
>>>waitress said with a small frown, "I'm afraid not."
>>>
>>>Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe?  With a cute smile, she
>>>said, "Yes."  I asked how much, and she responded, "Only two fifty, it's a
>>>great deal!"  I said with approval, just add it to my tab.
>>>
>>>Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and it
>>>was $285.00.  I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for
>>>two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf.  As I glanced at the bottom of the
>>>statement, it said, "Cookie Recipe - $250.00" I called Neiman's Accounting
>>>Dept. and told them the waitress said it was "two-fifty, "which clearly
>>>does not mean "two hundred and fifty dollars" by any *POSSIBLE*
>>>interpretation of the phrase.
>>>
>>>Neiman-Marcus refused to budge.  They would not refund my money, because
>>>according to them, "What the waitress told you is not our problem. You have
>>>already seen the recipe - we absolutely will not refund your money at this
>>>point."  I explained to her the criminal statutes which govern fraud in
>>>Texas, I threatened to refer them to the Better Business Bureau and the
>>>State's Attorney General for engaging in fraud.  I was basically told, "Do
>>>what you want, we don't give a crap, and we're not refunding your money."
>>>
>>>I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get any of my
>>>money back.  I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going
>>>to have $250.00 worth of fun."  I told her that I was going to see to it
>>>that every cookie lover in the United States with an e-mail account has a
>>>$250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus...for free.
>>>
>>>She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this."  I said, "Well, you should have
>>>thought of that before you ripped me off," and slammed down the phone on
>>>her. So here it is!!!
>>>
>>>Please, please, please pass it on to everyone you can possibly think of.  I
>>>paid $250 for this...I don't want Neiman-Marcus to *ever* get another penny
>>>off of this recipe....
