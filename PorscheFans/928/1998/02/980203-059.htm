I am slowing getting the bugs out of my recently
acquired 1981 928 (like for instance the
undersized Scirroco electrical coil that someone
put in it along the way - wierd).

I have three questions to put to the kindness of
list members, if someone feels especially helpful:

1) I have one dry rear shock, so I'm replacing both
rears.  Should I go with Koni shocks, and are the
standard "Sport" shocks offered for the 928 in
the Koni catalogue considered adequate?  If I do,
I want to correct what I feel is a sag in the rear
end.  How high should the body sit?  I have the
only 928 in the city or surronding region, so I
can't use a tape measure to check another one
(as hard as it might be to explain, I'd do it).  Are
the Koni shocks adjustable?

2) The alternator cooling tube and attachment is
missing on mine (as is the plastic wall that sits
ahead of both front wheels).  Is this cooling
needed?

3) The previous owner put 205 tires on this car
(hard Daytonas).  Should I get 225 as soon as
possible or does it matter much, given some other
needs?

Anyway, no big worries.  It runs like a clock and
handles at 200 like my Camry does at 120.
