Dear Adrian,

My Porsche mechanic told me of a 928 doing the same thing.. retension,
and a week later the light would come one.. after doing this SEVERAL
times, they found that the water pump was starting to go!  And the wear
on the water pump was enough to loosen the belt enough to make the
tensioner light come on... Just to give you an idea what could be
happening in there!

"Hola All,

I know that I've asked this question before, but I beleive I
inadvertantly
trashed that day's digest, so here goes...
Under light acceleration, the "Belt Tension" light comes on. When this
first
occured, I immediately pulled into a Porsche service establishment where
they
let the motor cool and retensioned it. Several days later the same thing
occured. My mechanic checked the belt and found all up to spec. The belt
was
replaced  30k ago and is no more than 2 yrs old. But the light is
driving me
goofy...!  Any ideas, comments, or adviso's ?

Adrian J. Canton U-928"
