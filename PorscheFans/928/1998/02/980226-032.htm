Titanium? That's the same stuff that the SR71 Blackbird is made of. Another
fairly fast and well designed machine. The lengths that those Teutonic
engineers will go to to save a few grams of unsprung weight. And how about
all that cast aluminum in the suspension? Outrageous ay what? 

It's those sorts of things that make the difference between a plastic
bodied, pressed steel suspension, American fallic extension and a finely
crafted piece of German roadware.
