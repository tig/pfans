Dear fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

Your rear wiper should only make two or three swipes per engagement. 25 is
way out of wack.
The fuse for same is probably in the fuse panel (passenger foot-well).

The intensive washer has its own pump under the reservoir. That is usually
the problem when it doesn't work.

About oil additives; DON'T USE THEM. At best, they're only a waste of money.
At worst, say bye-bye to your $10,000 engine. Use quality oil and filters,
and change them frequently. The cost of the additives (with unproven claims)
will probably be more than doing more frequent oil changes (which has been
proven to be a benefit to the engine's longevity).

Are you flushing your brake fluid every two years of more frequently? If the
answer is no, get ready to spend $$$ for caliper repairs or replacement. If
you do any type of performance driving, you should be having it flushed
every 6 months. Just some free advice.

Happy motoring. Ed

P.S. FYI; The Potomac Region Web page has recently updated their calendar. 
The "928 Frenzy Zwei" is correctly listed. Their site address is:
