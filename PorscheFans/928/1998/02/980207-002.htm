Howdy,
I use some stuff I got at a Grainger Supply Co. (same place I got my Proto
spring perch adjusting tool)   It's CRC Industrial Contact Cleaner and
Lubricant. 
It removes oxidation, grease, dirt and also protects electrical components
from corrosion with a non-hardening conductive film. I guess it's not exactly
like a conductive grease, per say, but it does work very well, and I like it
because it's both a cleaner and lubricant in one........FYI,  just my $92,800
worth.
