 art that they look like they belong in a
museum. The GTS that all this is going back into will FLY!  I can't say any
more as the "shop" has plans on releasing the official results of their
tests in articles and in their ads.
    The plans for "928 Frenzy Zwei" are well under way. Be looking for more
information as the scheduled date (9/26/98) appoaches. Keep in mind, this
year the technical event will be followed by a Concours and Autocross on the
next day. The price for the event will be about $20 for PCA members. An
event "T"shirt and all food/drink are included. The fee will be about $25
for non-PCA members and non-registered attendees.  All non-registered
attendees will not get a "T" shirt.
    The paper work needed to form a "928 Registry" within PCA has been
completed and submitted. More information on that will be provided as it
comes in. Stay tuned.

Happy motoring. Ed
