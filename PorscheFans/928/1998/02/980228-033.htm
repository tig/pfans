Help!  About two months ago the brain went out on my 90 GT.  While I was
trying to figure out why my beloved ride wouldn't start, I ran the battery
very low.  I noticed while cranking the engine with a low battery, that the
digital readout (in the area which indicates speed) suddenly started
displaying several straight lines in place of either a blank screen, or
numbers, (speed).  I eventually had the car towed,(flatbed) to the local
dealer.  $1800 later, got the shark back on the road.  Now every time I start
the car for the first time, the same thing happens  with the insturment
cluster.  After the first startup the problem goes away.  By the way, the new
brain made the engine run better.  Before the brain went,  I noticed that when
I would let off the gas when coming to a stop at a stoplight, etc., that the
engine rev,s would drop dangerously close to causing the engine to stall,
(actually died in traffic a few times).  Now the rev,s drop slowly and
precisely to the correct idle speed.  Just something for you shark hunters to
keep in mind on your next test drive.

  P.S.  Please excuse my spelling and puncuation, I am not an english major,
just a guy that loves the 928.
