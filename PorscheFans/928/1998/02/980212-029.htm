I wouldn't call it a stupid question, since I don't know the answer
*grin*.

I would expect the trans filter to generally last years, and the petro
oils
are generally compatible with the synthetics.  However, if it was me,
I'd change the filter unless it was extremely expensive, for two
reasons:

1.	it's probably soaked up a fair bit of the dino juice, and I'd
like a 
	"purer" synthetic soup (why dilute the good stuff?)
2.	the trans wears more with petro oil than with synthetic, so
you'd
	expect more bits in it
