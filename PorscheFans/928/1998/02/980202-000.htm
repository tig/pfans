Yes!  

Are you ready to cross the line into the 'nest'?  I think so given the
work you have done and are planning to do.  So get a copy of the owner's
manual for your year - it will unravel many mysteries you face
currently.  Not particularly expensive and a nice addition.  If the euro
version isn't readily locatable there are a number of US sources though
not all info may apply but most will.  (Someone else just posted
http://www.autolit.com so maybe try there too.)


The ! light is part of the central warning system.  It is there to warn
you, the driver, of various car system status alarms.  There are
differing warning status levels ie. level 1, level 2 , which either can
be cleared off the ! button by pressing it once, or, if the warning is
more severe then the ! cannot be cleared which is to serve as a constant
visual warning for you to fix the problem.


Good luck with the restoration - it sounds like it's in good hands!
Phil
