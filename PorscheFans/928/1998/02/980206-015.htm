Hello all,

The Club sport was basically the forerunner of the GT and in fact is the
same car as the GT except for a few small points:
Club Sport was only sold in Europe, was only available in GP White, had
same camshahts etc. as GT, had no sunroof, had wider rear track than
S4(same as GT) was only sold in manual and thats it as far as my knowledge
goes.
The SE was the United Kingdom version of the Club Sport.
So these cars were the same thing in fact and both were the same as the GT
but just had a different name.
It should be noted that these are VERY rare cars.
Keep (Sniffing) Phil ! but I'd still prefer your GT.
