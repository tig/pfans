O.K., I get the point about the expense, but I am unable to repair the car
myself... Not good enough of a mechanic, not enough tools and most important
of all, not enough time. I have done stuff myself before... and it has taken
me a long time to do things much simpler than putting in a new engine. Have
you guys not seen the amount of electrical connectors in the S4? That alone
can take hours to remove the "right" way! And I am not implying any of you
would do it the wrong way either.

Here is why I am fixing this engine:
The car is fully documented, meticulously maintained by the PO. He purchased
the car at the same dealer where I maintainede my previous 928 and I had a
very good relationship with them. They do good work and I am not forgetting
that they re tensioned the belt a month or two ago... They know the car, I
know the car (from all of the receipts from ALL previous maintenence and
repairs) and I am getting a 2 year warranty on the work. I am not wimping out
of a possibly money saving endevour, but my schedule and stress level do not
permit such an attempt now.

<< I don't have the GT engine anymore, but you definitly could get an S4
engine from 928 Intl for $3500, with an exchange. It would be half the price
of the cost to fix yours, and probobly less with shipping and installation.
