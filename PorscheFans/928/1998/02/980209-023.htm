No they are not. My 8 year old 9 pound cat got out this past July. Was
finally found 36 days later 3 houses away living in the drainage
culverts under the street. She weighed 3 pounds and could barely stand.
Up to 7-1/2 pounds now, the vet and I can't seem to fatten her any more.

I don't like black cars anyhow. Don't you think you are overreacting?
Black cars are a hell of a lot more durable and resourceful than you
would think.

To keep cats off cars, one simply needs to povide something more
interesting than a car to sit on. A window planter, for example. OTOH
its hard to beat a nice hot black car in the sun for a nap off the 
ground away from dogs.

God invented enclosed garages just to house Porsches. Isn't your 
Porsche worth it?
