It is my understanding that ALL Porsche are made by Recaro.  Well, maybe
not
those in some of the entry-level models such as 914, 924...

That's exactly what they are there for.  Due to the VERY large amount of

standard legroom in 928 cars, most do not need to move the seat back to
the second set of holes.  I have my drivers' side seat in the rear
holes, and
passenger side in front holes.

BTW, this is fairly common is European cars.  I once had a '74 Volvo and

was pleased to "discover" the extra inch of legroom.
