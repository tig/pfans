I Replaced one of the seat switches on my '87 S4 this weekend.  Thanks
to Kurt Gibble for his in-depth description in the FAQ and to St=82phane
for maintaining it.  I'd like to add a couple notes from my experience.

First, the switch itself cost me $59.50 + tax, ($70 - 15% PCA discount)
vs. the $91.12 listed in the FAQ.  Amazingly the dealer (Howard Cooper,
Ann Arbor MI) actually had one in stock!

When removing the bolts that hold the seat, I'd recommend using a ball-
nose hex wrench instead of the flat-headed ones like I have.  It might
have been a touch of corrosion, but I had a little trouble getting the
flat 6mm to fit.

If you're just cleaning the contacts vs. replacing the switch, the FAQ
says "To clean the contacts, it is not essential to remove the seat".
I wouldn't recommend trying it.  If the switch isn't flat when you open
it, the insides WILL fly everywhere.  Fortunately in my case, it was
the switch I was replacing and I didn't have to try reassembling it!
If you do decide to try it, disconnect the power first.  Once the switch
is apart, there is nothing to keep the contacts apart and the seat may
(will) try moving by itself.

Altogether it probably took me about 3 hours to replace the one switch.
This is partly because it was my first time - I'd guess I could do it
again in half the time, not that I'm planning to try it again soon!

A couple of questions did pop up:

Stuck to the bottom of the seat was what appeared to be a Recaro QC
tag - does anyone know if the seats were in fact manufactured by
Recaro?

Also, I noticed some alternate mounting holes in the tracks.  It looked
like it might be possible to mount the whole seat about an inch farther
forward.  Does anyone know if this is in fact the case?  I wouldn't be
interested in changing mine, but I know someone else who might.
