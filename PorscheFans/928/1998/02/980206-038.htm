Right on!  Compared to my previous car, a Maserati Bi-Turbo, the 928 is the
epitome of what a superbly fine, fast motorcar should be.  The Maserati was
more of a point and punch hot-rod.

> I've typed them in above.  The 928 came third.  (Put an S4 or GT into 
> that mix and it would have won!)
> 
> Here's the stuff they said about the Porsche:
> 
> "The star of our test is the 928. At $38,000, it is still in the 
> 'expensive' rather than 'breathless' price category.  It's a perfectly 
> usable everyday car, styled like an automobile rather than like a 
> spaceship, yet it outperformed almost everything else which we were able 
> to pit it against.
> 
> "Phil Hill says, 'The 928 must be the most highly developed road car 
> there is.  The minute you drive away you can feel the sophistication. 
> It's quiet, it has impeccavle manners, the controls are just right and 
> even though the chassis in front-engined, the Porsche is so good that it 
> allows you to get away with all sorts of sloppy driving that the M1, for 
> example, would never tolerate.  Everything about it is top class.'
> 
> " 'A terrific, terrific car,' says Stirling Moss.  'Absolutely superb, 
> it has very good adhesion with the Pirelli P7 tyres - they develop quite 
> strong cornering forces and give very smooth transitions.  The chassis 
> is very well balanced, with hardly noticeable understeer, then slight 
> roll oversteer on the overrun.  There's a super amount of smooth engine 
> performance in a straight line from the big over-head cam 4.5 litre V8.'
> 
> " 'The gear lever is a bit balky because of the remote linkage needed 
> for the rear-mounted five speed gearbox, and the leather interior isn't 
> quite as well finished as in the Mercedes.  But I'm very comfortable in 
> the cockpit, the controls and instruments are all in the right place and 
> I can see out all around.  The 928 is a genuine 2+2 road car with a 
> decent bit of luggage space, which most of these cars aren't.  One can 
> do absolutely great things with this car.'
> 
> "Cars really do have personality.  The Porsche 928 is friendly and 
> inspiring - an energy-giver rather than an energy-drainer.  It makes you 
> a better driver than you are, and provides a tremendous feeling of 
> security as well as high-speed indestructability.
> 
> "This is one of the few cars in the test that you could load up with a 
> month's worth of luggage and point toward the opposite coast with the 
> sure knowledge that you'd get there safely, in style and happier than 
> when you started.  It's a machine of inherent quality and a dirt-cheap 
> bargain, besides.  And, as Phil Hill says, 'It's the most sophisticated 
> car in this test - the undisputed star.' "
> 
> They wrote about all the cars, NONE of them as enthusiastically as this, 
> and then provided the following conclusion:
> 
> "Unanimously we nominated the Porsche 928 as the car we'd most like for 
> street driving.  It didn't win the test, but it's our favourite.  
> Although the Pantera scored the highest number of performance points and 
> can be technically called the 'best car in the world', it's not the car 
> we'd buy.
> 
> "The 928 is far and away the 'best value for money', as the British say. 
>  It shares with the Mercedes 380SL an uncanny combination of quality, 
> refinement, sophistication, strength and security that lesser machines 
> can't touch, even the ones in this rarefied group.  Plus, the Porsche 
> 928 flat digs in and -flies-.
> 
> "We'd say that the 928 is the best automobile for sale in the world 
> today.  How do we know?  Because we just spent four days driving the 15

> 
> There.  My morning's typing practice.  My main thought was, wow, if they

> the 928 S4 at today's prices is the bargain of the millenium!
