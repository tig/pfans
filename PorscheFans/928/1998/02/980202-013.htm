Check the archives.  There are several posts pointing to locations that
give solid scientific facts stating why one shouldn't use oil additives.  I
once posted a long message on it myself which was a copy of a webpage I
lost the URL to.  There are a number of good reasons for not using them.  I
don't have the facts to back it up in my head, but I can tell you the
reasons I remember.

1. Most additives contain PTFE, often refered to as teflon.  While this
will help performance in the short term, because it will line the walls and
increase slickness, it does a lot of damage over the long term.  This is
because teflon is a solid and will start tearing at the cylinder walls over
time doing much more harm than good.  But if you are rebuiding the engine
after each race, feel free to use one of these additives.  Remember, if the
can says shake well before using, then odds are it will settle in your oil
pan as well.  These same additives will also tend to clog up your oil
filter, assuming the filter is doing its job, it will filter out the teflon
and eventually cause oil starvation since the filter will be clogged.

2. Some additives are just a mix of detergents.  These are desinged to
strip away excess residue in the cylinders.  This means that it would
actually strip away the protective layer a PTFE based additive claims to
put in.  Putting a detergent in would be a good idea, except you can't tell
exactly how much a car needs.  Once it strips away the gunk, then it begins
to strip away the residue oils lining the walls, this you don't want to
have happen.

3. Other types of additives are simply heavy weight oils.  That's all.
Just 50W oil.

4. The University of Nevada Desert Research Center, DuPont Chemical Company
[the makers of teflon], Avco Lycoming (aircraft engine manufacturers),
North Dakota State University, Briggs and Stratton, the University of Utah
Engineering Experimental Station, California State Polytechnic College, and
NASA's Lewis Research Center have ALL studied [additives], and NONE of them
have found ANY evidence of [their] effectiveness.

Later...
