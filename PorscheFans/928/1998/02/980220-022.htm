Have hacksaw, will travel!  Phil (estine!)  No offense taken, as always
there is more than one way to skin a cat...

I cut my '90 GT shifter down an additional 1/2" !

This seems to be a cleaner way to achieve a shorter throw. Will the
part fit all 928's?  I seem to recall Philip E.'s post about trying to
adapt a different lever but without success due to differences in hole
spacing.

David, could you elaborate on this, I had a heck of time compressing the
springs on the shifter assembly and that was with a 'long-nose channel
lock'...

Further, depending upon your success with either method, there are some
pitfalls to keep in mind:

1.  Getting the assembly back together 
2.  Potential damage to the plastic shifter cup forward of the shifter
(located on top of the torque tube - any extra jiggling of the shifter
could accelerate wear and pop it right off - then you're in trouble!)
3.  Unwanted movement of the shift rod to the transaxle causing other
undue stress or wear
4.  Loss of brownie points at a concours?

This is definately not your father's Oldsmobile - stray from stock and
you could be asking for trouble, YMMV!
