Lock the door with the window open.  Unlock with the inside knob and
open the door.  Keep the key close to turn the alarm off because you
will wake up the dead!!

Look in the driver's door ledge.  It should be written down (in German)

If you try to activate the washer, do you either get a puddle of
washer fluid and a electrical motor noise, or no noise and no puddle?

If you have a puddle, you need to change the tubing going to the
nozzle (a lot of the rubber on my 85 is now dried out.  I would assume
your car is similar :(  )

If you do not hear the motor, check the fuse pannel, if that is OK,
you need to go after the motor itself (or its electrical connection)
