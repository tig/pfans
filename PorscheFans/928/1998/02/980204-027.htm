My 87S4 auto. manual (err) says that:- 'If you press the accelerator pedal
down "beyond the full throttle pressure point" to activate the electrical
switch behind accelerator pedal (kick-down) .... ... upshift from 1st to 2nd
gear does not take place until approx. 55Kms/h(34mph)'.
So at 6000 rpm. 1st should pull to 72Kms/h(55mph) aprox. (You have to shift
lever to position 2 to acheive this?)
I personally would like taller 1st and 2nd gears, I find the spacing between
2nd and 3rd too much and 1st gear too low, any ideas on what ratios would
achieve this?
Better still anyone stuck an extra cog in there to make a five speed box,
that way could push 3rd and 4th ratios up for more speed!!!
While we're at it lets have six gears with those buttons on the steering
wheel!
I know a man at Mercedes, I'll talk to him.
Or maybe we will have to wait untill they put the "V8" engine in the front
of the "New 911" with the "six speed gearbox" at the back and then we can
retrofit it to our cars.
Then all you 5 speed manual guys wouldn't be smirking at us auto. boys,
methinks! (Don't wish to create any divisions here in the lists!)
