I would love to have such a display.  Actually, I would like a display
that
would have;

1. Vacuum (would help know if we have a leak in the system)
2. Portion of time the injectors are on (on % basis)
3. O2 sensor reading
4. Fuel pressure (make it easier to find when pump or filter is bad)
5. Knoc sensor (tell if bad gas or bad timing)
6. Other misc. input that goes into the injection brain (early warning
of engine
    problems or faulty wires)

But I guess this type of instrumentation would scare the
non-mechanically incline
car folks and they might loose some sale :-(

Oh, well, I guess I need to take a few EE course and build the thing
myself (this device
is available from Stillen for Nissan car...)
