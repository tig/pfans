I don't have the owner's manual handy so I can't quote precisely, and
I would assume that LL et. al. have beaten this to death but the
owners manual states that the blower does operate on a very low
setting even in the 0 position.  All my German cars do this.  I also
vaguely remember from reading the manual that for the vent selector
the defrost setting and the left-most setting the blower speed is
controlled by the system not the switch.

If I have time tonight I'll quote the manual.
