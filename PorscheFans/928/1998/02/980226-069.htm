 That is, of course, the ideal.  It is simply a matter of *room* under 
the hood.  Putting two turbos under a 928 hood with intercooling is 
possible, but a total nightmare of expen$ive custom everything.  I have 
spent untold man-days under the hood/chassis of my 928s analyzing the 
conversion, and trying various trade-offs.  My conclusion is that a 
Vortech at 5 lbs boost (ie, no intercooler) would be the best bang for 
the buck.  In fact, that is what I had begun to do to my '85 DP car 
(except I'll be adding an intercooler for 12 lbs of boost).  I have some 
custom brackets, and most of the rest of it now, which, if I do decide to 
keep the car, I will be finishing it up this summer.
 But, if you could basically build a 500-550hp 951 engine and basically 
*drop* it in, all you'd be left with would be intercooler routing issues. 
 Yes, there would be a few other details to solve, but far less than a 
twin-turbo approach.  The motor mounts, and bell-housing mounts are the 
same.  This kind of conversion would be do-able by mechanicaly-inclined 
owners in their (well-equipped) garage.  I also think a "kit" could be 
marketed that would really make this a breeze. You'd end up with a 
reliable, serviceable, lighter, *relatively* inexpensive super-supercar.  
 Speaking of service, I'd like to see the mechanic's reaction when he 
asks you what kind of Porsche you need serviced.  "Uh, it's a 958"   8-O  
          :)
