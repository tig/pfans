performance gain by running higher octane fuel than your engine was
designed for. Is that true?"

All I can tell you is what my prof in college lectured regarding this
issue.   The sole purpose of octane is to control the flame front.   The
speed at which the fuel/air mixture burns translates to the pushing
power on the piston.   If it weren't controlled, the explosion could
blow holes in an aluminum piston, cause damage to valves, create
enormous heat problems, etc.   So, control over the explosion is
essential to efficiently and reliably convert to mechanical motion.

Engine tuning is really re-engineering the explosion control.
Increasing compression, valve timing, fuel volatility all are critical
components.

Gasoline marketing departments would have us believe the higher the
octane, the better for your car.  It is rubbish.  Engine design and
tuning will dictate the necessary octane- anything higher is a waste of
money.  So, I think you should listen to your father.
