<<I am just curious:  Does anyone know anything about "Prolong" engine
treatment?  I watch those great looking/sounding commercials where the
test drivers drive their cars without any oil in the hot dessert
conditions and I wonder if I need to go out and invest in this
"space-age" stuff.>>

I didn't respond to the other posts about this engine additive, but i
(this "I" intentionally left UNcapitalized so as to start a punctuation
war) just had to after this one.  And noone take offense, I am smiling
as I type this:

TELEVISION IS NOT REAL!!!

The Prolong commercials may show people driving around the track in
their car, but what they don't show is the total engine rebuild right
after the commercial.  Or, what makes you guys so sure there was only
one Viper used in that info-mercial?  They could have drained the oil
from one, then cut to another driving on the track chock-full of oil. 
Stay away from goofy additives and anything that has to be advertised on
TV after midnight.
Have a good / 928 / Porsche weekend everyone!
