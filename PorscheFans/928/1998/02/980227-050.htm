Don't be going amphibious on me! I think I was extremely lucky to get
the car out of the floodwater when I did (as in "with moments to spare")
I don't want to read some future post where some shark owner drowns his
beast and says, "but Howard got away with it!" 

But, seriously, I do appreciate the concern and support from you and the
List. Last night I went for a drive, what with the clearing weather and
the car's clean major service...and had a blast. The thing corners so
true (although I could feel the breakaway point, I didn't go there) and
induced a wheelspin or two. Then I returned to the phone booth and
changed back into my Howard Post, model citizen, diguise. 

Now, if I could just wipe this shi*eating grin off my face, nobody would
suspect a thing!
