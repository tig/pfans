I recently cleaned up my '86 928S and I believe the oil was coming from
one of the EGR(?) type hoses.  There are 2 hoses that come out of the
oil filler adapter on the right side near the front of the engine.=20
There are 2 more connections at the front, bottom of the airguide
housing,  and another one on the right side going into the throttle
housing, I think.  My hoses were a little loose, due to hardening
rubber?=20

I just looked to see if there is any new oil puddling and hurray there
is not.  I have about 50 miles on the car since the hoses were replaced.
My guess is the 2 hoses that come off of the right valve cover.  The
front one goes to the oil filler adapter and the rear one goes to the
middle of the throttle valve at the bottom right-hand side.
