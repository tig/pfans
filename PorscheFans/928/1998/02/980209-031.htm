Relative prices keep coming up on this list.  The different prices of 928s
between here and the US, even when the ridiculous exchange rate is
taken into account, still seem very bad.

So what are the real relativities?  Here's some figures on NZ prices of
various things.  I'd love it if  a few people out there with a spare minute
just sent back comparitive dollar amounts from where you live.  These
are Auckland figures, and may vary regionally even in NZ, and they are
also only small things I am familiar with:

Cars:
1989 928 S4, 78,000 miles - $55,000
New Lexus LS400, all extras - $174,000
New BMW 328i coupe - $99,000

Houses:
2 bdrm apartment/flat, 15 minutes from CBD, top suburb - $450,000 - $500,000
3 bdrm town-house, 10 minutes from the CBD, nice area - $300,000 - $350,000
3 bdrm family home, 1/4 acre, 20 minutes from CBD, average area - $250,000 - $300,000

Consumables:
Petrol - $4.00 a gallon (roughly) which is probably $3.20 a US gallon (? Andy)
Beer, Steinlager - $32 for 2 dozen 330 ml cans
Really good steak - $16 - $18 a kg.

Appliances:
29" Nicam TV, Sony - around $1700 - $2300 depending on deals
P233MMx PC with software - around $2400 - $2900 depending on deals

And wages:
Clerical, receptionist etc - $25,000 - $30,000 a year
Accountant in small company - $50,000 a year
Computer/network engineer - $60,000 - $80,000 a year (or more for the best)
Dentist - anything from $80,000 - $200,000 depending on how much they hurt

We'd pay:
$45 an hour for a mechanic or TV repairman
$40 an hour for a plumber or electrician
$120 an hour for a PC technician
$30 for a haircut
$2.95 for a Big Mac
$110 for a pair of Levis
$150 for a pair of Reboks or Nikes

There.  How about some comparisons.  (I know this isn't specifically related
to 928s, but I am sure that with all the price discussions it will be of interest.)
