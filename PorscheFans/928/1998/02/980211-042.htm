Once Upon A Time I tried to remove the rear bearings from my 928S. Then 
I took that casting to my local machine shop who charged only $15 each 
to heat and drop the new bearings in.

Its pretty easy to remove the casting which contains the rear wheel
bearing once you've removed the nut on the end of the half shaft. 
Removing the whole casting might make it easier for you to get the half 
shaft out of the bearing, else you'll be removing the half shaft from 
the transmission. Then again, once you are in there you might as well 
replace the shaft boots and regrease the CV joints.
