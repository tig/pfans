I agree with the advise offered by Ken and Larry. I spent a bunch of time 
working in that area of my 85 last summer. A couple of thoughts of my 
own. The idle speed regulator can be removed by taking out the big fat 
inverted T center intake manifold. This should give you enough room to 
work but beware of putting to much weight on the fender as you stretch to 
get in there. As Ken say's you will find a bunch of dried out vacuum 
lines etc when you get in there. The rubber 4 way splitters are almost 
certain to need replacement. $200 sounds like a lot of rubber hoses to 
me. I suspect it might not be that costly. Unless you're a nut for 
originality the generic stuff seem to work just as well and the $4 brass 
4 ways (there are 2) that I used will last for ever. The tubes on the 
idle stabilizer are molded in a specific shape so I would stay with 
originals to ease re installation. The idle stabilizer can be tested out 
of the car. Its a pretty simple design compared to the stepper motors 
that are often used these days. Applying 12v, just make quick contact and 
then disconnect it, will open or close the valve. I don't have a wiring 
diagram in front of me at the moment but I seem to remember that it has 3 
terminals. The center is common and the other two are open and close. 
Sounds like yours might be intermittent however so a bench test might not 
tell you too much unless you find something obvious like the valve 
mechanism all clogged up for example. If it seems to work you will need 
to decide on taking a chance or not. If you do in fact find a bunch of 
leaking vacuum lines that may well be causing your problem... well I 
might give it a reprieve. Once you've done it once you will be able to 
change again it in a couple of hours. $60/ hr is not a bad wage (even 
fixing pc's in New Zealand I'd bet) but its your call. Ed also makes a 
good point. It could be something as simple as "idle speed adjustment". 
This is not quite the right description as the idle speed is 
electronically controlled by the computer and is not adjustable. That's 
what the idle speed regulator does of course. What is adjustable is the 
minimum idle speed. If I remember correctly the procedure is to clamp one 
of the tubes to the regulator so that its effectively disabled and then, 
with a warm engine, the idle speed should be adjusted so it just runs. 
This should be lower that the correct idle speed of course. The regulator 
can increase the revs from this point but not slow it down. This sounds 
easy enough but is a bit of a bugger to do as the tubes are difficult to 
get at with everything in place. Perhaps there's another method??? 
Tweaking it until runs right might well be the way to go.
