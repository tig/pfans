Brian,

  I was just kidding around.  My remark was spurred by a question I posed
  to Loctite about the possibility of a steel bolt freezing itself into
  an aluminum block if Loctite treadlocker was used.  I asked (what I 
  thought was) a direct question but did not receive a direct answer.  
  Someone later found out that the Loctite rep who answered my question 
  was a 911 driver.  Although I'm sure that the rep's response had absolutely 
  nothing to do with the fact that the car in question was a 928, I made the 
  lighthearted suggestion that a fellow 911 driver might get a more pertinent 
  response (i.e. since many 911 drivers don't think the 928 is a "real" 
  Porsche...).  Since you straddle the fence in both the 928 and 911 camps, 
  your name came to mind.
  
  Loctite has since provided us with a detailed explanation of how their
  treadlocker products work and has provided advice on the proper application
  of the products.  No further action is required on anyone's part.
  
  I certainly didn't mean to offend anyone (esp. Chris Musante, the Loctite
  rep who did provide a timely initial response to my question).
