Talk to your agent about the specific laws in your state. In MASS a
single car accident usually involves getting some points on your
license and consequently a raise in your rates.  If there are
extenuating circumstances the "at fault" percentage may be less than
100% in which case you might not get any or as many points.  If you
are unsure or your agent can't answer your questions get a repair
estimate.  If the estimate is close to your deductible it's probably
not worth involving the insurance company.

Hope this helps.
