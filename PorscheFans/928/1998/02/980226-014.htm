Patrick,
           Its like if your first girlfriend was a nice sweet girl who
was nervous just to kiss you goodnight and now you find out she is a
Porno star getting ridden more times than a pony at a county fair.......
there just different now!

I do plan to add on to my Porsche by adding to the original design, I
have a K&N, I plan on adding headers and exhaust from Devek (20 hp), and
also Auto Authority chips (20 hp) plus the suspension will be Bilstein
shocks with Weltmeister springs, Front sway bar from Devek,
Cross-drilled rotors with carbon fibre brakes and steel brake lines plus
I am running Bridgestone Potenza So-2's. So you have to ask your self
will an 88s4 with 320 hp + 40hp give you a run for your money? plus
could you even keep up in cornering? and how much sweeter will my shark
sound at 6000 rpm's?. 

James

James,

You'd be happy to know that the hood crest is off of my 79.

Remember this...every time I kick the ass of another Mustang,
Z-28, Corvette, 300ZX, RX-7, yada yada yada, they think they've
just been toasted by a 928. Now, is that so bad?

I am fully redeemed. I own (2) 928s and one is totally stock
(well, the 84 has a K&N).

Until you get your car up over 400 HP / 400 ft.lbs, my 79 bastard
is faster than your 928.
