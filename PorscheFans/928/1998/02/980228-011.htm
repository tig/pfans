I have finally figured how to organize this web site for all us all to
benefit.  Please instruct all web users to catagorize their questions and
answers by  alphabet listing. Regardless of when, where or how long the
entry is, it will be catagoried on the web page by the appropriate alphabet
letter.  In addition, each user will set up a designated page in their word
processing package and call it, for example, "Car" and simply type in the
alphabet in vertical descending order, a,b,c,etc...z.  Now here is how it
works:  Say you are reading today's 928 web release and you spot number #011
listing as something pertinent to your needs, say tires.  Simply copy that
part of the page with your copy command under Edit, then move it over to the
word document under  the "T" catagory and paste it.  You will then end up
with a simple way to find the information when you want it  if you can
remember the alphabet.  What would make this system simpler is for the
members to submit their questions or answers by alphabet catagory.  Say you
want to answer someone elses question about tires...simply   type   "T   -
tires" and their your statement.  When we copy it to our permanent letter
file, it would be already classified and easy to locate when you need it!
I hope the membership uses this suggestion; it is a win-win for everyone.
