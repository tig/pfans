Since we've been discussing O2 sensors, it's been over a year since I
posted this and there are lots more of us now so I thought I might toss it
out once again.

The O2 sensor is not fused (at least on my '85).  Even if you're having no
problems, it would be wise to check under your car to make sure the wires
to the sensor are in good shape and not chafing against the heat shield or
any other metal surface.  When the +12v wire chafed through on my '85, it
instantly welded itself to the heat shield and within seconds melted all of
the insulation off of all wires feeding it.  Smoke poured from the fuse box
and I by the time I had the car stopped at the side of the road, several
wires had burned completely in two.

I think this must be a very rare occurence since I haven't seen any other
posts about it, but it's very easy to check the wires.  They should be
shrouded in a durable, heat resistant tube as they come out of the hot
exhaust system and should not be touching metal.

BTW, I drove the car for 2 weeks without the sensor and noticed absolutely
no difference in the way my engine ran.  I now have the sensor (fused at 5
amps) installed properly.
