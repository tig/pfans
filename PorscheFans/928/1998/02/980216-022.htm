Tom,
Common confusion, when you add the adjusters to an early 928 it will raise
the height up about an inch.  What makes the difference is the spring
height, on early cars with out adjusters the springs are longer than they
are on the later cars with adjusters.

You need to change the springs and add the adjusters at the same time in
order to get the result you are looking for.

If you really want to get low try using later springs without the adjusters
and you will get about a 2" drop and the tire will be just even or slightly
above the fender line. This will work with factory 7" 65mm offset wheels and
225s  with no rub at all, any other size and you are on your own. Caution
when you get this low you will experience a slight amount of bump steer.

P.S. Be sure to get your front suspension aligned after any height change of
over 1/2 to 3/4".

Good Luck,

David Roberts
