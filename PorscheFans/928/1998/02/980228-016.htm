    You are right, there are exceptions. I know a guy with 296,000 on his
original engine and transmission. He started using synthetic (Mobil 1 I
think) at 275,000 in the engine. He has had synthetic in the tranmission
since 180,000, and hasn't changed the oil since then, (no drain plug in a
1990 9000 manual transmission). He has less leaks in that than his wife's
140,000 mile 900, and she has always used conventional oil. My mechanic said
that my engine is good enough that I could try synthetic and probably not
have leaks, but it isn't worth the risk.
