I've noticed the following header in most all MIME gibberish messages:
> X-mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 4.71.1712.3

Must be the standard email client in Win95? If there isn't an easy way 
to disable the overcooked MIME formatting in that client, may I suggest 
replacing it with something else? I've been very happy with Eudora Lite 
from http://www.eudora.com/ and its free. These days I use exmh, also a 
freebie, but I'll bet you don't want to install a Un*x clone such as
http://www.freebsd.org/ on your PC (also free).

Also note that MIME is not the problem. The problem is that your email 
client is sending a multipart MIME enclosure. The first part is 
"quoted-printable" plain text. The = signs at the end of lines are 
escaping the end-of-line sequence. You'll notice a paragraph does not 
end with the equals sign.

The really big problem is the 2nd enclosure is a copy of the 1st part
but formatted in HTML. Many email clients have no problem with your
message, other than suddenly the font, font size, and background color
is different than expected. The digest is a different matter, those
readers see your message in the raw no matter what their email client
can do.

If you read the headers of this message you'll see that it too claims 
to be in MIME format (because it is). Its not MIME that people are 
complaining about, its "quoted-printable" and the multiple enclosures.
