Hehehe.....optimistic aren't we Andy? .....Speaking of upside-down burning
wrecks, I just got the newest issue of Panorama, and as usual started looking
for any articles or pictures of 928's (other than the Devek and 928
International ads), when I found one on page 51....not a pretty sight! Oh,
there are also a couple in a picture on page 76, but as usual, the 928 is
nearly non-existant in their publication......I'm sick of it..... We don't get
no respect! I need to borrow someones cat to have walk on every car mentioned
in the issue that isn't a 928.  :) 

Jason, as far as the door locks, I rarely use mine, but I'd think if it was
really annoying you could take out the lens and lightly spray paint the back
of it white and it would tone it down some.
