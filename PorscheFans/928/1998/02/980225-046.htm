Hey DR:

Question, if you know:  When were dual airbags implemented in the 911
series? Were any Porsches single airbag equipped ever?

I always thought airbags would be best mounted in the bumpers or
something, outside.  Someone parking by touch?  POW!  Not with my car,
you don't!  Trying to break my windows?  POW!  Step back, Jack!  Cat
crapping on the hood?  POW! to the moon!

Ooops, ok forget about that last one!
