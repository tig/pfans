I went through very similar frustration over the past months, and maybe
can condense some of the great help others gave me here on THE LIST.   I
have a 79 Euro, and therefore have the basic CIS system without computer
or airflow sensors.

1.  Make sure all vacuum hoses are in good shape and fittings are tight
(no leaks!).
2.  Go  buy "How to Tune & Modify Bosch Fuel Injection" by Ben Watson
($19.95 at Border's bookstores) and follow the instructions.  Credit to
Phil Eskildsen here (hope I got your name correct!)
3.  Spend the $100 for the correct fuel system tester (NAPA sells them
for that  price,       The Bosch unit can be on sale for the same).
4.  The fuel warmup regulator ("fuel pressure regulator") can be had for
$200 new.
5.  You can check fuel pump/delivery for free by following the service
manual.
6.  The fuel distributor is the last likely component.

Your problem sounds like fuel delivery - when engine asks for fuel, too
little is available.  Short of very expensive 'sport repair' (ie
replacing components until you get lucky), the system should be
approached in three stages - first is fuel delivery which is pump,
filter, lines, accumulator.  Second is regulation which involves the
warmup regulator, air valve, cold start injector, and engine temp
sensors.   Third is the fuel distributor.

I replaced the warmup regulator (because everything pointed to it), with
negative result.   All that was left was the fuel distributor which was
replaced with a used unit from 928 International - and that fixed it!

Hope this helps - please keep us posted about progress and results.
Good luck!
