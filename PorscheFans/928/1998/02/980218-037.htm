Well, I picked up another interior so that I can get it to a presentable
point, cosmetically. The original was fairly frag'ed.

I'm waiting on Russell stainless steel braided brake lines (I want to
get a better, less mushy feel to the brakes). 

I decided to change valve covers (previous used pair was leaking
slightly)
and I'm waiting on an order from Summit.

So, I'll get the better interior swapped in this weekend, put the brake
lines on whenever they come in and get back to the motor break-in mode.
I still need about another 9 hours on the motor.

Then, I'll be meeting with a friend from work that has a nice welder and
begin re-doing the exhaust system. I've been running around with the
stock single pipe and I _know_ this is way too restrictive for a 6.3
liter
motor! I'm gonna open that up with a dual 2.5 inch set up.

Lotsa time in the waiting state,
