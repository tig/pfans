Vince, you are the McGyver of the 928 list!?!

Here's some tidbits that you might like:

- Remember those license covers that obscured the plate during flash
photography ie. red light monitors?  Subsequently ruled illegal.  Now
there is an aerosol spray!  

- Remember thinking, "I wish I had a button to turn all these traffic
lights green"?  Well appears alot of big cities have sensors built into
traffic lights that respond to either the cadence of emergency vehicle
strobes, or, the specific pattern of an add-on strobe.  Still urban
legend at this point, but supposedly some electronics / auto-buffs have
devised an infrared "chrome box" to activate those sensors, undetected.

- No further progress reported on the 928 cloaking device... (or flux
capacitor engine swap)

Ok that last one was a joke, but the first two are real!
Phil
