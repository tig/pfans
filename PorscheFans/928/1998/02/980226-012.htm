Actually, that is what GM rated them at when sent from the factory, but the
actual figures given off through some drag racing showed that many of them
weren't near as high as GM claimed.  The last year or two (or something
like that) GM made some changes and rated them at 405 BHP, but I think that
was as much to play contender to the Viper as anything else.

I have driven several Vettes and was not greatly impressed by them.  They
do handle pretty well, but they are not even a comparison to that 928 you
are getting in terms of styling, quality, etc.  Nor even in stock exhaust
note.  When driving a 928S I feel like I'm in a Formula 1 car or something
and feel like I have to punch it going under every overpass or over every
bridge to enjoy listening to that wonderful exhaust note.

Besides, how do you think the ZR-1 Vette got where it was?  German and
English engineering.  :)
