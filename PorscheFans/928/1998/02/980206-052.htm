Ok experts - Shine for me:

According to a recent compression check - my car shows 135-144 
compression in 7 cylinders and 90 compression in one of the cylinders 
(#6)

My mechanic says that he is usually so impressed with the head design 
of the 16v 928 that he wouldnt even worry about this (as being a bad 
valve or leaky ring). He says that since the car has been 
sitting for 2.5 years, he thinks that there is a good chance that 
there is a carbon buildup on one of the valves which is keeping it 
from closing entirely, causing the compression leak, and that driving 
it with some good detergent has a good chance of solving the problem 
before they go into the car and look for a busted valve spring etc.
He even gave me some fuel treatment called 'pro-line' to put in the 
tank for a road trip im taking up to Arizona Next week.

I called up my dad, who has been working on engines since he was an 
embryo, (even though he has no professional or recent experience), 
and he says he can't believe it. 

The reason I'm not terribly stressed at this point is because the 
shop DID get my car to give out numbers good enough to pass smog - 
which was the whole goal. They said it will pass easily as long as 
the car is at operating temperature (Good and hot) he said, when I 
take it in.

PS - I didnt get one request for help with MIME..
