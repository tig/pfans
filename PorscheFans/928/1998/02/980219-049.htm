Good question - I'm sure we're all going to be following this thread. 
There are a number of camber plates / tools available by mail order from
racing catalogs.  Most use bubble floats like spirit levels.  Toe is
another story but also readily available.  I don't know how easy a home
alignment will prove without a lift, service dig out, or those 'slidey'
tire pads (let's the wheels float around so you can adjust settings). 
This might be one of those jobs where it's easier (and maybe more
accurate?) to pay a few bucks to the shop you trust?  

If you do so and you have either lowered your car or have special
settings, don't tell 'em about it until it's on the lift being done as
most non-race oriented shops will back down from non-stock settings. 
Some b.s. about liability and folks abusing the 'bring it back for free
adjustment' offers (back after every race to change settings for free). 
I had this kind of 'argument' with a shop on a different car and know
what, the rears couldn't be brought close to stock anyways (still over
cambered).

Oh well I guess you gotta' try, huh?
