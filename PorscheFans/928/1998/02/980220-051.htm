I'm joining in the discussion of how to identify a GT vs. an S4 because
it may shed light on a question I have about my '88 S4. Susan at Devek
was asking me if I'd bought the S4 with the GT tail. I have noticed that
most S4's have "Porsche" stamped into the rear panel between the tail
lights, whereas my shark has a recessed reflective band connecting both
tail light lenses, a la recent 911's. Above right is the 928S4 insignia.
Is this a "GT" tail? (Other than the S4 insignia) I know my beast had a
rear repair rather early in its life, 1991 if I recall correctly, and
I've wondered if that would explain the reflector strip. Its not the
aftermarket kind because the rear panel receives it flush, as if it were
designed with this in mind. Anybody recognize this description?
