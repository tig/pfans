Hi everyone,
I've been around for a good while just reading all of your info and
learning. I've been looking for about five months for a 928 and have posted
a couple of times when i had questions, otherwise I've been invisible. 
Anyway if you're wondering what the subjuct means ,, the story goes like
this.   I've looked at about 3-4 928's in the past six months and either
they're not taken care of or they're the wrong color (want a black one) or
they are a bit out of my price range. I'm only 22 so damn near everything i
want is out of my price range. :)  Well, last week I was driving home in my
mustang and caught the shape of a 928 out of the corner of my eye sitting
at a small carlot.  Needless to say U-TURN.  OK, so the car was a metallic
BROWN.  It might still be a nice car so I walked up and figured it to be
about a 82-86, I tried the door handle figuring it to be locked since it
was way past closing time. The door opened. Lock Broken?  hmm.. Very clean
car with tan leather.... And I looked up at the odometer and it read an
astonishing  31,980 miles.  Can you say rolled back.  On the door jamb i
saw the number 85 so I figured it to be an 85.  Returning the next day I
learned that the car was an 83'  the 85 was the year of safety laws it
could meet.  They didn't lock the door because they didn't know to lock it
from outside with the key.  Looking the car over, engine is super clean,
never liked those wheels, 1 egg mark on driver's door, a few scratch marks
behind that(not bad).  Upon opening the trunk and lifing the carpet and
looking into the spare tire compartment I found that even the compressor
was still there.  I had brought my mom with me because I work for the
family businesses and credit is a little harder for me to get. I wanted at
least an 85' so I thought I should wait for another one to come along.
About a block away my mom said why don't we go back so I CAN TAKE IT FOR A
TEST DRIVE.  Am I dreaming?  Must be midlife crisis I thought..We went back
and she bought it. Away with her supercoupe ,, Hello 928! The car checked
out with flying colors.  A call to the previous owner confirmed the
miles(all done before purchase of course).  I've already fixed the rear
wiper, and the antenna.  Well now there is another woman 928 owner, but
I'll have to do on here since my mom doesn't even want to learn how to jump
start a car.  So I don't drag this out any longer, I have a few questions. 
The option codes aren't on trunk floor,, Where else can I find them??  Was
there an optional sound package for this year car, it has the little holes
punched in the leather with the speakers underneath?  Also  this is a
technical one,,,,,  sometimes at idle and when I'm giving the car very
light throttle i hear a buzzing noise from the right rear area of the car
(fuel pump ?), any ideas?  Could anyone offer any ideas to solving a
shorting sound from the speakers when the radio is shut off And replacing a
blown speaker in the door?  Any worries I should have about a remote start,
and keyless entry install being done on this car? SORRY for making this
into a novel,, but I'm pretty excited about the car,      I'll probably
take up a whole days list when I get my own.. Thanks for your help.
