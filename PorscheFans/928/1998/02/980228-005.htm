Interesting how they use Al Unser, for example, to give expert testimony
on the effectiveness of Pro-Long, etal.

My ol' Hoosier logic engages (corn fueled, I might add) - I have enough
confidence that car manufacturers would jump at any additive or
'treatment' which would effectively guarantee no moving part failure.
Cynics will feel that those crafty manufacturers actually design failure
so they can generate revenue through repairs and parts.   It is, of
course, hooey.   A marketing department wet-dream revolves around
superior reliability and operating costs, including repairs.  I've
casually discussed this issue with GM and Ford engineers at several
engine manufacturing plants as well as final assembly operations.   No,
I don't claim to know everything, but my job puts me in contact with a
variety of industry and gives me a chance to chat about interesting
subjects like this one.    I better stop now and minimize the boor
factor for all of us.

I guess if I were gonna drive my 928 without any lubrication on the salt
flats, hey....I'd treat it with Pro-Long first.....what the heck?    But
good old maintenance - even with dino oil - is pretty effective.

One last example - I just rebuilt a very poorly maintained 928 engine
with 130k miles on the clock.   There was no ridge in the block, and I
could barely mic out any bearing wear.   I put new rings and bearings
and buttoned it back up.   It now runs proper compression and good oil
pressure.   This engine design deserves the raves it gets for
durability, even with marginal care - at least in my one and only
example.

Most of us bought the car to have an example of extraordinary
engineering and elegant execution of same - and I for one am not
disappointed.
