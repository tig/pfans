Dear Fellow Sharkers,

   What would be a fair price, for buyer (me) and seller for 4 Yoko AVS =
with 1988 S4 rims. They are original 16in and will fit my 83S which =
sorely needs new tires. The tire have only 400-500 hundred miles on =
them.  Also, my car is used year round in NY/Long Island.  So far the =
winter has been very mild but I was looking for a good, all year tire.  =
The Michelin Piolot Z4's were suggested. Are the Yoko's good all year in =
my area.  Now that I have my shark back (after 2 1/2  months in the =
shop) I'll be a contributer and question asker.  Thanks for the help.
