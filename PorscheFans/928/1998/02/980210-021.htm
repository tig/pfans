Fault is supposed to matter to your insurance company, but unfortunately
ins. co.'s can drop you for no reason.  That happened to my father,
who's
a very safe driver, but was hit once by a 1 foot diameter boulder that
fell
out of a dump truck, and once by an uninsured driver turning left onto
a freeway.
