To All:  My '79 shark has cataracts:  Looks like a film of oxide slowly creeping over the
surface of the reflectors inside the glass.  My mechanic tells me there's nothing to
do but purchase the whole d--- uppen poppen assembelwerk.  Has anyone had this evil 
malady curse them, and is my guy right (he usually is)?

On a separate note, the trim around my rear windows has turned from shiny black to dull grey
metallic.  I'm assuming this is due to the anodizing going west - is there any way to resore
these pieces? (This may be the same thing happening to somebody who was talking about different
color trim a few posts ago).

By the way, I LIKE not having 2.5 inches less headroom in my sunroofless vehicle; it's one reason
why I bought it.

By the way II, I'd love to know what company uses Ferraris as company cars!
