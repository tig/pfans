 I have an early 86 928s with the early small brakes.  I plan on taking the
car to the track and I know that this can be a problem by the way the car
brakes on the street after hard use.  I plan on flushing the brake fluid,
replacing my rotors with factory parts and possibly going to a braided steel
line.  

What Brake pads should I get for this early brake system.  I drive the car
hard on the street and will see some track time.  I would like the pads to be
relatively quiet 
and I really dont mind if the brake dust dirties my wheels, as long as they
work!

Does anybody have some experience with a particular company for up grading to
braided steel hoses?

Finally,  I have been working around cars for years and have found that if I
want something done right I usually have to do it myself.  I want to rebuild
my steering rack myself.  Where can I get a rebuilding kit?

Thanks
Glenn
