By the nature of the responses I got about the search engine,
I think I should clarify what the initial intent and operation
might be like. I've got all the pieces in place and am ready to 
prototype an example page. Once that is done, I'll post it
on my personal web site for evaluation, and then I'll send
the scripts and examples to the PorscheFans listmaster/webmaster
to add to the PorscheFans web page.

Simply put, it will allow you to search PorscheFans archives
for any of the keywords you type in, and will respond with
results in the form of a list of messages containing the keywords
you wanted. In the beginning you will be able to select which
list or all, and later could add in a date range, perhaps
something like last N months. The results are links to the messages
so that you can navigate to each easily.

Technically, it requires that each message be tagged so that after
a search there is somthing to navigate to, so some post processing
must be done on current and future archives, but it's a relatively
simple script and should drop in. I'm assuming that the webmaster
won't mind the free work, but someone will have to integrate it in
to the PF website. 

I'll let everyone know after I've got the prototype working. I've
got a couple weeks worth of 928 digests to use as an example database,
so it would be helpful to limit your testing to 928 stuff.
