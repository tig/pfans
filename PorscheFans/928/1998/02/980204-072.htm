Whoa.  Before you freak out too much - I believe the '82s have gas
slotted front discs from the factory (my '84 did).  How many slots did
you count per rotor?  I think there's supposed to be 5 but not sure.

Is your car still shuddering down the road?  Better bring it in to a

Let us know what happened!
