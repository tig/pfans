Shalom "ya All,

 I'd like to thank Brian for his suggestion regarding my AT 3rd gear slippage.
Generally here in Tampa I take der U-Boat to Gary McCullum at Reeves, whom I
beleive possesses the world's complete data base of 928 knowledge in his head.
It was Gary who knowing my propensity for fast, hard driving, showed me how to
adjust the shift points in my AT to shift at higher RPM's thereby increasing
my "YeeHaa" quotient.
In a DEVEK mailer some time ago, it was suggested that if you advance the
timing 20 degrees(?) there is a hidden wealth of HP which may be brought out.
Has anyone done this mod...and what where the results...?
After getting kissed in the ass by a couple of strippers putting makeup on in
the rearview, I need to install a new bumper pad shock on the portside of the
U-Boat. Can anyone offer detailed instructions...?
In regard to the mysterious "rattling" noise, when I first purchased Ute(i've
named it yet...!)I experienced what I beleive to be the same. Turns out there
is a service bulletin concerning bell housing rivets which work themselves
loose after some time. Replacement offers the cure.
Thanks to all for some wonderful and informative reading.
