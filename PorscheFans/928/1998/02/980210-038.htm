Nope - they changed all the rules in about '88 or '89 and completely blew
away the high values of second-hand exotica.  If the pre-1990 rules were
still in force then my 928 would be a $100,000 second-hand car and there
would not be the proliferation of used Japanese imports.  We'd possibly still
have the remains of a car-assembly industry, too!

I'm not sure of the figures now, but I think it's just the GST of 12.5% that we
pay on import.

>(BTW, NZed dollars were .76 USD at the time, I think)

Now I wish THAT was still true!!  I'm just planning my spending money for
a US trip later in the year, and at the moment one of my dollars only buys
58 cents US!!
