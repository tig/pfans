I am the somebody / author.  'Phallusy' was entirely deliberate, and came to
me hanging out some washng.  The sentence was a little contrived, owing to
lack of time.  The desired result, namely humour, seems to have been
acheived.

Perhaps Moila was alluding to her lack of partner?  Some boyfriends can be
real 'tripods'.

On another note, surely someone from Oxford would use the Oxford in
preference to a Webster ?
