Here's my story.
last August a fellow i work with told me (surprisingly enough) that he had a
928 and was thinking about selling it. i had just got some insurance money
from a Sunbean Alpine that had been wrecked so i said that i might buy it. he
left the key on my seat one day and i immediately went out for a test spin and
was hooked. just holding the darn key was enough!
my car is a guards red '82 5-speed of the type that needs help with most
everything. so far i did the timing belt, water pump, tensioner thing and
threw in the front crank seal, with plenty of electrical problems still to
fix. this list has been invaluable and entertaining, and also occasionally..
dumb, but what the heck, it's worth it. i can tell that everyone that actually
owns one of these cars really enjoys it.
OK, i currently need help with my headlights. they recently stopped working,
both of them. they pop up properly, but do not light, even on high beam. i
have checked the fuses with a voltmeter and get juice when the light switch is
turned on. is there a switch in the motor that raises the headlights that is
malfunctioning? or what? any advice would be appreciated.
