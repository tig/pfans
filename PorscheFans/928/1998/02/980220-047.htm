German Corvette Fans!

After eight months and $2000 worth of aggravation and headaches the mechanic
says he fixed my 86/928s.

It's back to itself...chipped and piped with racing headers. The test run
returned with the highway patrol following us back to the shop and an "ear
to ear grin."

From his description, there is a copper electrical bus above the fuse/relay
box in the passenger's footwell. This bus had a hairline crack that would
arc, surge, get hot, all that stuff; and screw up the central nervous system
and black box.

We originally replaced all the relays, spark plug wires....all that stuff
and the problem persisted. Sometimes the car ran great and other time, it
would sputter and misfire and then take off. The heating and arcing finally
fried the black box....most of the expense.

So the solution involved finding/detecting the crack in the copper bus and
soldering/replacing the parts.

If you are having inconsistent electrical problems with your 928, this might
be a place to look.

Regards
Bill
