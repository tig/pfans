Someone mentioned Accusump oil systems recently.  Since I have used the
on SCCA race cars for many years (before I was married), let me bend
your ear for a minute.  Accusump is an oil reservoir which retains from
1qt to 3 qt of additional engine oil.  It works along with your
coventional oil systems and does not require a dry sump.  The Accusump
system does several things well. First the pressurized sump allows
complete oiling of bearings during intial start at a time when the oil
pump is not fully pressurized.  Secondly the oil sump manitains oil
pressure during hard cornering (such as racing) when the oil pump
pick-up may become exposed to air, thus assuring bearing lubrication and
engine life.  Thirdly, and more crucial for racing, accusump allows a
car with a bad oil leak from blow gaskets or large rocks in oil pan to
safely make it back to the pits under its own power without making an
expensive engine into toast.  Fourthly (??)  it is helpful for cars
which sit for periods of time, like all winter< in giving a good dose of
oil on that crucial first start.  The units cost less than $200 for all
the parts and mount in the engine compartment.  Pegasus 800-688-6946 is
one source of supply to the racing community.  For the initial cost this
system is priceless for anyone with a desire to maintain oil lubrication
on their expensive motors.  As you may be aware, aluminum does not have
a great self oiling characteristic when dry.
