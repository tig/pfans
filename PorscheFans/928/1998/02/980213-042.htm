Mike, I also have a red 90 GT.  Recently I noticed the only speed I could get
my blower to run on was high.  After making sure the switch was working ok, I
decided to the problem must be in the resistor pack since the resistor pack
controls current to the fan motor.  The resistor pack is located on the front
of the  blower ducting about mid car.  Its necessary to remove the  plastic
tray at the back of the engine compartment to access the unit.  The connector
for the resistor block is one of the usual large plastic ones used throughout
the car.  I simply removed the connector from the resistor block, then pulled
the rubber connector (the two inch wide rubber band that connects the blower
housing to the air box) to the side.  This allowed me to reach far enough into
the air box to grab the resistor unit from inside the box, hold onto it while
I unscrewed the resistor unit, then pull it out thru the opening between the
blower box and air box.  Its a tight squeez and a little painful on the arm
but it beats removing the hood and blower unit.  Once you have the unit out
just bend the metal tabs aenough to remove the cover.  I used a fine piece of
sandpaper to clean the "point like" contacts inside the resistor block, then
cleaned up all the contacts and replaced the cover.  Its been working fine
ever since.  My blower also runs on low speed as long as the lower slide
switch is in the outside air position(White rectangle on switch and control
unit line up) however if the switch is all the way to the left there is no air
coming out of the vents.  The other thing I noticed is that the air
conditioner pump would not come on while the resistor unit was bad.  Once I
fixed the resistor unit the air conditioner started working again.  Hope This
helps.

Rick..red 90 Gt.
