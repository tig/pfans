I'm sure that pretty much everyone will tell you this is snake oil except
for a few people who have fooled themselves into believing it is good
because they don't want to admit they are wrong.

First off don't be fooled by all of the demonstrations which show an engine
running without oil.  Any new engine will do this, at least for a while.
Briggs and Straton conductive several engine tests.  One such test was with
multiple identical engines.   One engine was simply treated with oil, the
others with various additives including slick 50, Prolong, etc.  Then all
engines were drained.  These engines were then run for 20 hours without
oil.  All of them ran the full 20 hours.  All of them.  Then they were tore
down and inspected for ware.  The engines which received special treatment
were actually more damaged than the engine without any special treatment.
I could go into this even more deeply, but I don't have time, so I will
leave you with this:

- "The University of Nevada Desert Research Center, DuPont Chemical
Company, Avco Lycoming (aircraft engine manufacturers), North Dakota
State University, Briggs and Stratton, the University of Utah
Engineering Experimental Station, California State Polytechnic College,
and NASA's Lewis Research Center have ALL studied [additives], and NONE of
them have found ANY evidence of [their] effectiveness."

Moral: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Later...
