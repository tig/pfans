Hi all,
I noticed a post a few days ago from someone who had obtained headlights from
J.C. Whitney for their 928 < S4. I agree. I also bought the same units for my
'86 last fall. I got the 90/130 watt halogen bulbs and they really brighten
the night!

I was concerned with the extra current draw of the higher wattage bulbs
stressing the OEM electrical equipment. I installed additional relays mounted
in the headlight pods and took power from the  +12 V terminal at the right
front of the engine compartment. I used one relay for the bright filament and
another for the dim filament in each pod. I fused each headlight for 15 amps
and used #14 wire. I also ran another ground wire from each headlight to a
nearby ground connector terminal.

Here is the results of that mod.

With the original hookup to the headlights, I measured 12.5 V and 9.5 amps at
the headlight with the brights on and engine running. That's 118.75 watts.

After installing the relays with the more direct current source, I measured
13.5 V at the headlights. The current was still about 9.5 amps. The power now
was 128.25 watts. Pretty close to the 130 watt rating.

The extra 19 watts (9.5 per headlight) dissipated in the headlights was hardly
noticeable, and that alone wouldn't have been worth the effort, and expense.
The main benefit is that the 19 watts is now used at the headlights and not
being used for  heating the original, barely adequate,  wiring, fusebox, relay
contacts, and connectors. This should help, however minutely, to increase the
electrical system reliability.

If you are considering higher wattage shark eyes, I think this is worth doing.

Just my 928 watts worth.
