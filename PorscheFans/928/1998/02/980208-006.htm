Howdy y'all,
My '83 has the leaky windshield. I was about to ask the list about this. At first I thought it was the sunroof leaking. All drain holes were found to be
clear. Also, if the sunroof leaked, it would leak through the sunroof hole, not from the head liner!

So, how does the windshield leak? I presumed the water would run up the windshield and enter the car. But, it will leak sitting still in a rainstorm or a car wash. Yes, it is embarrassing where it leaks and drips on you :*(

How is this fixed? I thought of running silicon up under the windshield trim strip. Not professional, but cheap and easy. Would the correct way be removing and re-installing the windshield?

Thanks,
Brian Scudder
