 Does anyone know if anyone has tried/done a 944 Turbo engine conversion 
to a 928?  I have a few friends running their 951s in the 400-500HP 
range. I can think of several advantages this would offer, including 
proven technology, relatively inexpensive, significantly lighter, better 
mileage, and still Porsche. One of my best friend's 944 is putting 420 
ft-lbs at the wheels; the car is unbelievably fast (3,000 lb).  A 928 
with a 944 engine would probably weigh 150lbs less, and give the car a 
slight rear weight bias (ala 911).  PowerHaus built that engine, and they 
feel that a 600hp 944 engine is very do-able with daily-driven 
reliability.
 Just an idea.  Feel free to shoot it up. :)

That's the spirit!
