Hi Sharkers!!

Due to Peter Walkers Query:
>Question is, can the damn things be patched???
(gas tanks)
and the countless other times that this has come up, I now post!

I had mine plastic welded, a 4" crack had formed on the bottom drivers
side (US drivers side) and was a steady dribble.  I have been
withholding this information because:
A.  I have not checked with the welder to find out if he is interested
in doing more.
B.  Wanted to give mine a chance to leak if the technique is not sound.

He did it just like one would weld w/metal,  routed a "V" in the tank
along the crack, hooked up his plastic "MIG" apparatus and buzzed
(squished) the crack shut.
2000 mi and no drips!

Mail me and I'll follow up with him about doing more: Otherwise I'll
leave it at .02 !!

Later
