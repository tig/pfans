This is by design; It only stays on for maybe 5 or 6 seconds.

The high intensity washer fluid is stored in a separate reservoir under the
hood - yours could be empty. Refer to your owners manual for the location
of the reservoir (read: I don't know where it is), the manual also lists
the Porsche approved fluid for use in the system.

Everything works just fine on your car......Learn to trust Porsche!
