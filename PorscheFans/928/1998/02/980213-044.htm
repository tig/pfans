Hi Guys,
I have a few questions that perhaps I can get answered.  I've  driven 5 928s
in my search for "THE ONE", from a 1982 to a beautiful 86 1/2 all with autos.
How are these cars supposed to shift?  The 86 1/2 shifted instantaneously
through the gears, actually made me smile.  Inside of course, I didn't want
the seller to know how much I enjoyed that!  All but one other shifted lazily.
The sellers remarked how smooth the trans was. I'm sceptical, should it be
smooth or sharp?
 I've read a lot about replacing the timing belt (chain ?) at 60,000 miles. Is
it a belt (rubber) or chain (metal) ?
Finally, what is a torque tube, what does it do, and are there a lot of
problems with them ?
Any enlightenment is greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Dan
.
