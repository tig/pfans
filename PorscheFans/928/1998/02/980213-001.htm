Just bought a brand new (black) rear luggage cover for AUD$380.00. In USD$
that is $250.00
This was from a major Dealer/Service Centre who had organised a local
upholstery guy to make them. 
Not only is it brand new, but it also has all the fittings included and it
took me 30secs to fit.
For Leonard Zech and other OZ shark owners it was York Motors in Sydney and
the guy who organised it was Vince. "Tell him I sent you"
Unless you already know of course!!!!!!!
