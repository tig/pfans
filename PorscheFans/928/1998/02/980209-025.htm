Thanks for the input Ike.....Yeah the 8.5's are the same as the 10's...just
thicker silicone jacketing on the 10's. Let me get this straight, the 951 (944
Turbo--8 valver) has different wiring and connectors that the 944S? So
apparently, he now has some that will work for the 944S? 
Yep, no ignition wires will give more HP. (no matter what they claim) 
Mine are ok...no miss or anything...just due for replacement at 74,000 miles.
I'll let you know if I get them and how they work. Thanks for the input and
increasing my knowledge on the other water-based variants of Porsche.

Regards,
Greg S.
