  Here's what I wrote to Loctite and the response they gave.  I don't think
  the response will alleviate any concerns...  (I went to their web site to
  find the product numbers (www.loctite.com).)

Hello,

  I participate in an 1100 member internet discussion group concerning
the Porsche 928.  A recent topic of discussion concerned the use of
Loctite to prevent oil pan bolts from becoming loose.  Some have heard
that Loctite should not be used on the engine of the Porsche 928 
because properties of Loctite 243 would cause a chemical reaction 
which could permanently freeze a steel bolt in the high silicone 
content aluminum block.  Is this true?

  Hope you'll be able to shed some light on this issue.  Eleven
hundred technically oriented minds want to know!  Thanks!

I have reviewed your application and have a few suggestions.

As you know, Loctite threadlockers are single compound liquid adhesives
which completely fill the microscopic gaps between interfacing threads.
They cure to a tough solid when they come in contact with metal in the
absence of air (anaerobic).

Loctite 243 achieves significant strength in the presence of light oils
whereas Loctite 242 should be applied to a clean surface.  Loctite 243 has
a breakaway value of 180 in.-lbs. as compared to Loctite 242 which is rated
at 115 in.-lbs.  Both values were on a 3/8" x 16 steel to steel bolt.  I
believe the chemical reaction you are referring to is the curing of the
anaerobic product.  As you can see, product 243 is stronger than 242.

It is suggested that a 8.8 or 10.9 grade steel bolt be used in a Porsche
application.


Regards,
