Well I've been needing a good car fix lately and have been thinking about
an S4.  I had an 1983 S for about six months then sold it for various
reasons that I won't get into. What I'm wondering for those of you that
have driven both the  S and S4 is difference between the new and old manual
gearbox in the two cars.  I think that a change was made in the mid 80s to
a different type of transmission, as well as the changes made to the clutch
system over the years.  What I'd like to know is if the new S4 I'd like to
get will have a better feeling (easier to work) trans/clutch than the 83 S
that I had.  

Thanks for any feedback please CC response to stewartm@cyberis.net
