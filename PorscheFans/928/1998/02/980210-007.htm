>1989 928 S4, 78,000 miles - $55,000

I've seen prices around $20-30K depending on condition and mileage, no
current comparisons.

>New Lexus LS400, all extras - $174,000

About 1/3 of that.

>New BMW 328i coupe - $99,000

Around 1/3, again, if I am remembering right.

>3 bdrm family home, 1/4 acre, 20 minutes from CBD, average area - $250,000
>- $300,000

No idea with the first two, and since housing prices vary widely here in
the US, my parents bought about 2 acres and built a 4 bedroom, 3 story home
here, about 10 minutes from local shopping and business areas, for about
$125K total here in East TN.

>Petrol - $4.00 a gallon (roughly) which is probably $3.20 a US gallon (?
Cheap stuff, $.98, 89 octane is about $1.08, and 92/93 is $1.18

>Beer, Steinlager - $32 for 2 dozen 330 ml cans

Sorry, no ideas here.

>Really good steak - $16 - $18 a kg.

Nor here.  Steak prices vary widely depending on the cut.  I've had superb
steak at $3 per pound, but I know that some cuts can me many times that.

>P233MMx PC with software - around $2400 - $2900 depending on deals

No idea.  My 386/40 is too slow to calculate that number up here.

>Computer/network engineer - $60,000 - $80,000 a year (or more for the >best)

I've seen similar numbers here for them.

>$120 an hour for a PC technician

Ouch

>$30 for a haircut

$7 to get mine shaved off every 3 months :)

>$2.95 for a Big Mac

Right now with them on sale, $0.99

>$110 for a pair of Levis

About $30-40, sometimes on sale for less.

>$150 for a pair of Reboks or Nikes

Wow, some things never change :)  Guess since they come from just up there
in Asia, they can send them to you as cheap as to us....
