Hi all.  And sorry for the 'ricey' subject line - just high on the day
as no sooner than the 'must visit Devek' message got planted in my
subconscious did I find myself not only making a bee line to Belmont but
dragging along Jim & his S4 too! 

An innnocent drop by visit turned 100% productive too as Jim was
battling a weird engine stutter only on full load ("this is bad, I got
smoked by a Cadillac!"  "What?  No way!")  Of course he had already gone
through some by the book diagnostics and I showed up with a vacuum
tester for more head scratchin' .  Our verdict?  Off to Devek and hope
Marc is in!

I got to tell you what I heard in Jim's driveway as his car was just
idling sounded nasty!  Like an underlying rod knock or scraping or
something.  Even worse on the highway as he demonstrated some passing
manuevers and I listened - hell I was worried the engine would blow!

To make the story short one of the coils apparently wasn't firing
properly if at all - Marc produced two new Bosch '88 spec coils and
voila the beast was back!  Jim is once again a happy camper and looking
forward to joining the horsepower wars in a big way (heh heh)...

What more to say?  But glad to be able to turn to the pros!  

Alright, no more ranting (or second guessing) outa' me (at least
tonight)...  I gotta' get online and get your latest messages!

Phil
ps.  Oh yeah - HEY HUCK I left your goodie box at the shop for 'Rubin' -
new t-belt, etc.

pss.  You all get your latest excellence already?  Why is mine so dang
late always!
