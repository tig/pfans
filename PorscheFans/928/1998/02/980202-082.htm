That brings up a question I've been asking myself for years (without getting
any good answers from myself).  What is the difference between horsepower
and torque?  I understand the "seat of the pants" descriptions popular among
motor-heads that don't really know what they're talking about, but I don't
remember the physics principles very well.  (Something about ft-lb versus
ft-lb/time.)  And, how do these numbers relate practically to driving a car?
It seems that (if I remember correctly) my 1980 Euro S has more horsepower
and less torque than the US-spec model of the same year.  Which is "better?"
