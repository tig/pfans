	1. Yes a synthetic oil can either harden or soften oil seals, actually 
dino oil will slightly harden seals with time.  NEO sythetic oil actually 
improves old seals, it's the best!  My gearbox keeps working better with 
the NEO gear oil.  Early synthetics were alot worse, now it shouldn't 
really be a problem.  If you want to get rid of sludge you could use one 
quart of NEO with dino oil run it for a few days and then change it to 
all NEO.  Any 10 year old car will use some oil, so it would be hard to 
put all the blame on the type of oil.

	2. Do you need to make a thread repair, helicoil not enough, helicoil 
stipped?  REID tool supply has several types of thread repair kits, 616 
777 3951  They don't seem to have a min order requirment either.

	3. I just got a card in the mail for connector cleaner & lubricant, 
Miller-Stephenson chemical company.  I havn't used the stuff yet....  $10 
for a sample 1-800323-4621
