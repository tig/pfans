 I have a 1979 928 that is an after-market convertible conversion
(obviously).  I'm having a heck of a time locating replacement
weatherstripping for the window / roofline junction area.  It is a specialty
weatherstrip with a channel that receives the window edge, rather than the
standard strip with the rubber beadthat the window lays against.  I've tried
 numerous convertible specialists and weatherstripping manufactuters without
success.

Any information on the shop that did the convertible work or on this
weatherstripping would be appreciated.  I have not been able to locate a
plaque or other markings on the car that would normally list the name of the
shop.  From what I have been told by various Porsche dealers and shops is
that the convertible shop in question did 50 of these conversions though
nobody I've talked to has any other specifics.

Any info would be welcome.  Thanks.
