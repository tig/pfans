Glad to have you aboard!  I'd love to get over that way and see Europe, but
right now, I'm stuck here in Tennessee in the US of A.

>(BTW How much do you pay for gasoline in the US/Canada?? Here we pay 1.16

Right now I pay $0.95-1.00 per gallon.

I don't have too much personal knowledge to help with the
mechanical/electrical problems, but I do know about hail.  Actually, when I
saw what it was doing to MY car, I think I said, "Oh, Hell."

Anyway, I had my car fixed for $100.  That's right, just $100 and you
couldn't tell there had ever been any dents in it on the hood, front
fenders, roof, doors, etc (that was what he offered to me for doing the
job).   It was called paintless dent removal, and that might help you out
on the unibody part of the car if its not in too bad of shape, and also on
some of the other areas of the car.  The person doing the work takes lots
of long metal tools and "rubs" the dents out from the other side.  Even
under a flourescent light, you really could not tell the car had even had a
dent in it.  And that way you escape any bondo (body filler) in the car and
repainting of that part (but you might want to have the whole thing done if
replacing other parts.  If you can find someone over there that does this,
you might want to look into it if they have a good reputation for their work.
