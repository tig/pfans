My beloved '82 Indischrot friend has an interesting problem. I was driving
spiritedly down I680 on the east side of the San Francisco Bay when the car
began to shudder rapidly. I pulled over and examined it and found nothing
wrong except that the front left wheel and the rear right wheel were a bit
warmer than the others.

Later examination in the daylight showed something more alarming. Both
front brake disks show a very frightening scoring, as if they had been laid
flat and chopped at with a cleaver. The scoring is quite neat and precise,
so much so that it almost looks like it belongs there.

The rear disks are intact, but show some evidence of rust (!) though they
are quite new.

Ideas? Imminent master cylinder failure perhaps?
