Are there any other shark owners from Aust. reading this newsgroup who have
advice on workshops in Brisbane, Queensland?

 Does anyone have any recommendations regarding sources of spare parts (new
and secondhand) in Australia.

After acquiring my '83 928S a couple of months ago I have been reading
these postings with interest and learning rapidly about the great "shark".
The info shared is sensational,,, thanks to all ,,, will contribute when I
have learned something unique.

Thanks

Dean
