It may be that theinsurance company in Evanston refered to last night, was
The Evanston Insurance Company.  They are (were) a specialty market
insurance company that sold its products through special, or what are called
"surplus lines" agents.

I was a licensed "Excess and Surplus Lines Broker" when I was in the biz,
and I did some business with Evanston.  I don't know if they underwrote
track risks, but perhaps so.

To check them out, you need to contact an independent insurance agent...a
BIG agency, because the little guys on Main Street won't know what you are
talking about.  They probably have someone on staff that handles this sort
of special risk insurance.  You may have to work at it though, as even big
agencies often do not have any expertise in other than vanilla
insurance....even your shark is too exotic for most.

Also, in Pano there are a couple of brokers who advertise "track" insurance.
