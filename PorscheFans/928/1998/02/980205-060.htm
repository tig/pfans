Well, It's time to say hello to the group.

	I purchaced a 1983 928S in October and have been loving it ever since. 
As you all know, these cars are living creatures with feelings.  When I
got the car, I realized that the dash lights did not come on.  Feeling
really bummed about this, I was reading the posts and getting ready to
dig in and replace a lot of lights.  I had spent some time working on
some of the switches that were broken and giving the latest addition of
my family the tender loving care it diserved, and one moring while
driving to work it decided to reward me.  The dash lights and climate
control lights came on!  Several weeks later, the right outside mirror
motor started to work.  Needless to say, car and driver are becoming
very, very close.

	As a little side note for those of you experiencing battery drain out
there (I remember reading about a few.)  I initially had that problem. 
As I was hooking the radio back up -- the PO had a radio in place, but
not a single wire was connected -- I found a live wire touching the
floorboard under the passenger foot area.  I could hardly believe it. 
(needless to say -- not stock.)  I have no idea what it was once
connected to, but one thing for sure, now it is NOT connected to the
battery -- and I have not had to jump the car since that.  As you can
see from above, my pet shark really appreciated that.

	All in all, if you ever are feeling down, give your car a bath, rub on
a nice coat of wax, and take it for a quick run through the
countryside.  It will surely reward you!
