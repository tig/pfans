>> the previous ones are being recalled?

I  found out the hard way after I bought a 94' 840 for a bundle of cash,
only to have the motor run like crap. My local BMW dealer said it passed
the compression and leakdown test, and they have a policy of not replacing
the engine or shortblock until it fails the test. Now that's what I call
customer service....
