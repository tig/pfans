I'm steadfast in my belief that you have to try it and *measure* it, 
else its simply a lot of marketing hot air.

Keep a logbook in your car. Write down the brand, grade, milage, date,
price, etc. Note if it was highway or city driving. Keep a calculator
handy and figure the gas milage before driving away from the pump (HP 
calculators are the best, don't want to be seen with a disposable 
calculator in your Porsche).

Buy the brand and grade it takes to prevent engine knock and ping under 
load. Also look for good idle. And watch for the milage. You might find 
a brand that your car(s) like. You might find a poorly calibrated (in 
your favor) gas pump. 

You'll never know unless you document and measure it, all the name
brands are good enough that seat-of-pants over days or weeks won't work.

I'm buying Chevron mostly these days. Sometimes Shell and Exxon. In my 
area Shell is more expensive than other brands, possibly because all 
the Shell stations are brand new fancy things. My cars don't care for 
Conoco (takes several tanks before idle gets rough). And anything that 
contains alcohol. Driving north from Alabama to Indiana I always get 
several MPG better in the Infiniti than on the return trip burning 
Indiana gas.
