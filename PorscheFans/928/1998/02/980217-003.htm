Hi Tom,

Depending on your final gearing you were either just under or just over
100mph. My spread sheet which I used to calibrate my speedometer, before it
went out, shows 91.4 mph @3400 rpm. I have a 2.75 final drive and use
d40m2s (225/50/16). 5th gear goes through at 1:1. 4000rpm is 107.6mph,
5000rpm is 134.5mph, 6000rpm is 161.4, etc...

You were only just getting to the point where the car comes to life. It
gets really exciting when you get into the last 1000rpm on the tach before
redline. That's when you realise how strong even an old shark is.

Good numbers huh?
