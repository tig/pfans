Hi everybody!
In a previous message I told you I bought a '82 928S.
I asked some questions and I had several interesting, helping, encouraging,
and competent replies.
I WAS very happy... A dream turned into reality...

Now reality is turning into a nightmare! :-(

I said that despite the body needed some MAJOR repair the engine ran smoothly.
Well, it did... For one day! The day after I signed the purchase contract,
the injection system decided to get stuck.

Maybe she does not like me??? 

Anyway, I still have not driven my 928, not for a single meter!
Since I got her, I just kept paying mechanics bills.

Here's the problem description:
I've emptied and cleaned the fuel tank - It's OK
I've replaced the fuel pump and the fuel filter.
cleaned the fule hoses from/to tank/fuel pump.
Cleaned injectors... They seem alright.
The problem seems to reside in the fuel injection "head"
(BOSCH part # 0 438 100 027)
It turns out it leaks a huge amount of fuel. The fuel drips in the
underneath chamber (just below the air intake valve) it fills it up... and
if the you continue operating the engine (WHICH TURNS SMOOTHLY!) the fuel
will eventually end up in the cylinders.... then in the oil pan.... Forcing
to change oil/oil filter - Which I did.

What I fear is that PO took apart the inj head. Definitely ruining it.
The new replacement "injection head" costs something like 2,400 USD. There
are some refurbished ones for some hundred dollars less.  Considered I
payed 3,360 USD for the whole car... I'm doubtful.
I even considered installing a MOTRONIC elctronic injection system instead
of K-Jetronic. But I'd spend more... and not get quite the same performance.

The problem is that, since I've not driven this car yet, I do not know if
everything else is properly operating (i.e. brakes, transmission,
electrical devices, accessories,...) 

It seems there are no 928 for parts around here. A porsche mechanic has
one, but the guy asked me 1,200 USD to get the fuel injection system of
this car. Isn't it too much for used components?
Any suggestions? Should I demolish this car, and look for another one?
Should I get the used system?
I hope there is some solution I'm not considering right now.

Tnanx for your help and support. I hope to ride at your side one day!
