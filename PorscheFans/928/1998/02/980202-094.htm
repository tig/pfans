The "radiator" cap on the reservoir has a calibrated spring that will 
bleed the cooling system pressure off it it gets too high. Typically 15 
psi. The only numeric markings I see on my cap says, "100". 100 what?

Appears the '83 928S bleed-off is vented to the ground. The use of a
pressurized reservoir appears to be common in European designed cars. I
like the design used on my Infiniti G20 better: the radiator cap
overflow (bleed) drains to the bottom of a catch tank. When the system
gets hot coolant bleeds off into the cool catch tank. When the system
cools the former overflow is sucked back into the radiator. Supposedly
this system has no air in the coolant. Whatever air is in the coolant
gets blown out the catch tank.

A pressurized cooling system is a good thing. The higher the pressure, 
the higher the boiling point.

'83 928S
