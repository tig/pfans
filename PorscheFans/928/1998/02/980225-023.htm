Hello shark owners,

I have a 1978 car for sale. I've only owned it for a couple of maonths and
now I'm forced to sell it. I bought it from a man here in southern
California who bought it from the orginal owner in 1980. He drove the car as
his personal car until about 10 years ago then it joined the rest of his car
collerction.

The car has 141,200 miles. It's painted a Porsche blue (I don't know the
name of the color) and has auto transmission and air conditioning. I have
replaced the alternator and fixed an oil leak. The PO gave me many receipts
from the years he had owned it and lots of work has been done. It drives
very well. The tires are new and are mounted on phone dial rims.

I live 20 minutes from the San diego airport. Please call me at 619 579-7900
Pacific standard time during the day or e-mail me at chucks@prusd.com.
