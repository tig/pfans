Phil,

I never said it was the only way, just the proper Porsche way ;-)
I just glad no one suggested to use a blow torch ;-)

>I cut my '90 GT shifter down an additional 1/2" !
BAD BOY, BAD BOY, what did that little 1/2" gain you?

Yes, all Models, I have one on my 79 Euro , my 89 S4 and of course it was
standard issue on my 89 GT ;-)

Use 1 pair of needle nose vise grips to hold one connection closed while
using the needle nose channel locks etc. to compress the connection that you
are putting the spring clip on. I use a second pair of needle nose vise
grips to hold the clip secure and insert it into it's groove.
Of course I have done it over a dozen times and practice does make perfect.
;-)

Using above procedure should not be any stress at all on the shifter cup or
assembly (well maybe the first time I did it and got frustrated )

Good question, but I bet you would lose more points if they know it was
"Hacksawed"

That's why Porsche has the Stock Part available that was designed to be used
with the existing shifter linkage. ( GT linkage and S4 linkage same part #)

FYI, this shifter lever was also standard on the 88 Club Sport (option code
M637 - Special Version Club Sport)
