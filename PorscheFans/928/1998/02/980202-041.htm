This is by design.  The intent is that at speed, you will not get much
water on the back window (got to love aerodynamic, oups, shouldn't say
that word...).  With this in mind, the back window just need a couple
of "swipe' once in a while so they designed the switch that way.

Do you have fluid in the high intensity reservoir?  it is not the same
as the
regular winshield washer fluid.  On my 85, it is located at the very
front
of the hood (where your front flap actuator is located).  On an S4, i
think it
is located on top of the blower moter, ie at the very back of the hood)
should
have a red filler cap.

Someone with an S4 can verify the location for you.  If you have fluid
in there,
you will need to check the tubing, which can dry roth, or
relay/fuse/switch...
