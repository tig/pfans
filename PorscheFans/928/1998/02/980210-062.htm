Hello there.  I joined the list recently in anticipation of finally achieving
an ambition I've had since the 928 was introduced. Now I have a line on one
sooner than I was expecting (thanks to my wife, who spotted one looking lonely
and dejected.)  It is a '85 with 52K miles, that needs some body and cosmetic
work (rear quarter just behind the wheel, new front spoiler, some dings) and,
I'm told, some work on the power steering.  I'll probably stop by tomorrow and
look it over in more detail, but I want to have a good mechanic take a look at
it before I get serious about buying it.  Where and who do people recommend in
the DC area?

Thanks,
David
'88 Ford pickup
(maybe soon?) '85 928s
