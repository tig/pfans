Stephen - My '87 makes about 4 sweeps of the rear wiper before
automatically stopping.  There's a relay located behind the tool panel
just to the left of center.  This might be related to the hatch release
or associated interior lighting or, more probably, it's related to the
rear wiper action.  I don't know if there's also a fuse.
My intensive washer system worked fine but the regular washers were
inop. until I pulled (carefully) the entire plumbing setup from the
inside of the rear of the hood and found that a hose had come free from
one of the "Y" fittings in there. The intensive and regular systems are
plumbed in "parallel" with 4 check valves and 2 or 4 "Y" fittings
leading eventually to one hose to each of the two nozzles.  Of course
first I verified that the reservoirs had fluid and that the pumps
worked.
HOWEVER, back to the rear wiper:  does yours automatically engage with
the drive plate when you close the rear hatch?  Mine does not.  It
engages only when I activate the wiper with the switch (and stays
engaged until I open the hatch again).  If I don't hit the switch the
blade assembly is sort of free to move to the edge of the rear hatch
glass or even onto the adjacent painted part of the hatch.  I'm
wondering if this is just a matter of adjusting the resting position of
the blade assembly so that its engagement pin automatically meets the
hole in the motor plate.
