How long do these fans usually stay on after the car is turned off? On my
'87 they are still going after half an hour or so (and that is after easy
driving, with the ambient temperature around 50 degrees or so)
Is the sensor on the intake manifold the only one that can cause the fans to
activate with the ignition off?
Please excuse the newbie questions, I haven't had the car long enough to get
used to it yet.
Any recommendations for a good 928 mechanic in the Seattle(USA)/Eastside
area?

<Howard, I don't know what kind of magic thermostats they have on 944s, but
changing the 928 T/S to a lower temp unit (e.g., 75C), will not in any
way,shape or form alter the cooling fan trip point. The engine will run
cooler (agood thing, generally), but the fans will still come on at the same
temp asthey do currently.
>The only way to alter this is to replace the coolant temp sensor mounted at
the bottom of the radiator for one that has a different resistance
vs.temperature relationship. Other triggers for the cooling fans
includeswitches (meaning a single temp value) for auto transmission fluid,
A/C systempressure, and intake manifold air temp (this one triggers the fans
only whenthe motor is off), and the pushbutton for the A/C system which has
amicroswitch which triggers the fans ON.Steve - 87S4/auto/GP white
