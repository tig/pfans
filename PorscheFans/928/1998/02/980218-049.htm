Just got back from my road trip from tulsa OK to Chicago and back.  almost 700
miles each way took 9 hrs.  total oil added, about 1/2 a qt. I was filling my
tank when I was on the bottom white line of indicator ( did not wait for
light) and car would take anly about 17 gallons and when full, would indicate
a full needles width below top full line.  

I was averaging about 80-85 mph, a few sprints, trafic and construction,
average came to about 20 mpg.  I could have swore I got about 25 mpg before I
did a Very major tune up.  Maybe I fixed all the air leaks in the intake and
my rebuilt injectors flow more.
