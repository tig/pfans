Hello all,

I noticed that one of my rear wheels wiggles just a bit.  I have not
noticed any odd sounds.  Looking closely, the hub and axle assembly is
moving in relation to the carrier.  My guess would be the wheel bearing? 
Is this something that I can take the carrier/hub assembly to a machine
shop and let them press off the old bearing and press on the new one, or
should I let a repair shop do the whole thing.  In the manuals there is
reference to heating the carrier to 300 degrees, is this neccessary? 
Could another part other than the bearing be causing this wiggle?

In the manuals there are pictures of the engine 1986 engine with 2 CO
test tubes, one at the rear of each cylinder bank(pg 24-204).  My engine
only has 1, at the rear of the drivers side cylinder bank.  Have I maybe
lost 1 of the CO tubes or is this the way it is supposed to be?  

Also, I would like to check my CO level myself.  Does anybody know of a
method to rent a CO meter or use a meter while adjusting the CO level?

I found that with the accelerator floored, the throttle was only opening
about 1/2 way.  I adjusted the cable and checked the WOT sensor
position, now working.  Also I adjusted the push rod that activates the
kickdown switch.  The manual spec for this rod adjustment is 48mm +/-1mm
between ball head centers.  This seemed way to short to me?  I adjusted
this to 68mm overall length which is 48mm in length excluding the ball
heads.  This activates the kickdown switch without excessive effort when
the accelerator pedal hits the stop.
