Has anyone heard of PS systems.  I looked them up on the internet. They are
out of Miami Florida and they will rebuild a 928 rack for $179 1 yr warranty.
I have emailed the guy twice and each time he responded the next day.  There
really isnt much to a rebuild and this price is really more in line with a
rebuild for any other car.  Does any one have experience with them?  I paid
twice this amount for a rack that was suppose to be a rebuild. It came back
filthy and needing bushings.
