Thanks Jim and John,

I'm clear now.  I love ascii pictures!

I understand the upper and lower assy's are different. 
The upper control arm and ball joint are replaced as a
unit (bummer) and the lower assy. is built-up.  The
lower unit has 3 pieces; the ball joint, the ball joint
carrier, and the control arm itself.  Replace the
aluminum carrier (if fitted) with steel and ball joint
(if worn) on the lower assy.
