	Went thru entire car and cleaned all the electrical ground points....2 above
	fuse panel, 1 under instrument pod,  2 coil strap to engine wires,  2 on the
	right front engine bay, 1 on left front engine bay, 1 engine to body, and the
	battery ground point. Others I missed?  

There's also one on each side, rear corner.  You need to slightly remove the rear quarter
panel to access it.

	Removed and cleaned every fuse, relay, and bottom row of connectors on the
	fuse panel, along with the EZK and LH control unit connections and many, many
	misc connectors under there and under the instrument pod. 

	Verified charging is well, however the guage still reads 13 to 13.5 volts when
	it's really charging at 14 volts.  

The voltmeter is known to be off calibration.  You can adjust it internally.

	Went thru the manuals and did all the EZK and LH tests that can be done
	without the groovy diagnostic tool and oscilloscope, and all is well except
	for the oxygen sensor which does have the correct voltage (between .1 and 1
	volt) when running, but the voltage reading does not increase when throttle is
	applied. (should increase)
	Ordered one today from Vertex today for $119.50.
	I've seen posts mostly saying that the oxygen sensor will not affect
	performance, but I spoke to someone at the frenzy with an 87', and he said
	that when he replaced his, it made a big difference. 

It's best to get the exact replacement O2 sensor.  Alot of people think that all O2
sensors are the same.  Not true.  Some are more sensitive than others.  The LH/EZK system
is an adaptive system.  It learns and constantly adjust its internal lookup parameter
tables according to your driving environment.  The O2 sensor does play an important role
as part of this system.
