This didn't exactly match my experience with my '82.  I obtained a shift
lever from an '86 (still have it) and found the hole spacing was closer
that on my '82 shift lever.  This would not have been a problem except
that due to bends in the '82 shift rods, it was just not possible for me
to get the rod ends close enough to fit the hole spacing in the '86
lever - this, along with the difficulty (for the average non-expert
shifter-replacer) of getting all the little plastic bushings, springs
back in led to my recommendation of hacksawing.  Am I crazy (well, it is
just barely possible) or it it possible that your '79 Euro shift rods
(along with '86 and later rods) don't have the two little jogs I found
in my '82?  My shift rods and lever look kind of like this (jog
exagerated):

O <-lever & knob

|----------------\_____________  top rod
|                         _____________   bottom rod
|----------------/

BTW, a hint for spring compression I found here and will probably use
next time:

1.  Compress spring (off lever) with vise grip.
2.  Wrap with fine copper wire to hold compressed.
3.  Install springs, bushings, lever, circlips etc.
4.  Cut copper wire with small wirecutters.
