I know of several more, though they're probably not subscribers to this 
list.

When I was looking for my 928, I drove a beautifully maintained 86 
automatic
that belonged to a woman who decided it was time for a Jaguar.  She ended 
up
selling it to another woman in the area.

My wife has a friend who bought herself a black/black 87 automatic last 
spring
as a present for finishing her residency in neuro-ophthalmology, I think.  
Just
in case you're wondering, she's happily married.

My wife would like to be a 928 owner - she's looking for a 85 or 86 
5-speed.
Problem is I haven't figured out how to pay for it yet...

I suspect that most women who do own Porsches just aren't list subscribers.
Many if not most of the 944s I see are driven by women - but there are very 
few
on the 944 list.
