I just went through the process of blasting treating and painting my intake
runners.  
I called the guy that is listed in the tech section of the panorama mag.  He
was the one listed under paint and interiors I think.  He knew the answer and
quickly rattled off that it was I believe an 83-84 944 color Zemuratt silver.
Any good paint shop will have a sample book and be able to mix up a new and
improved epoxy mix.  
I got very good results and the color is perfect.  Good luck.

Leaving for chicago from Tulsa OK friday, I hope the shark does well!!! its a
9hr drive
