If anyone who reads this list has had their front suspension rebuilt....would
you give me an idea of what you had replaced and what the cost was.

Local independant exotic shop here in Raleigh has stated that all ball joints,
tie rods, steering rack, bearings, and shocks/struts need replacing.  The
bushings
were all ok though.  Let me know what your experiences/prices were.

Also, found that my alternator is not charging correctly, what do ya'll
recommend?  Rebuilt or new? Bosch/Other? 

By the way.....Pirelli has the P8000 Vizzoli...which is a Z rated aquatred
design.
Talk about a smooth riding tire without sacrificing any of the performance.
And
the tire is rated 40K.  Priced right at 134.99/ea (225/50 ZR16) These replaced
the Yokohama A0008...which were too slippery in the rear (on
acceleration....or is my foot to heavy?)
