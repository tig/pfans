Just a reference to your shifting issue:

My '79 Euro 5-speed, 130k miles, has the obligatory paper synchro
syndrome.   First is non-existent, and second growls readily until
enough oil is sloshed through the gearbox to quiet it down.  As a few
'regulars' in here know, I've only recently been able to hop in the car
and tool around at will (and folks, the thing is running great and the
miles mystically float away.......).

I put off any attention to the gearbox since everything went into the
engine rebuild and putting the interior/exterior back together.   I
decided to change the gearbox oil as a failsafe and to help the synchros
mesh a little better.  After a quick run to Sears for the $8.99 17mm
allen wrench required on the plugs, the oil was drained.
Whew......sort of a runny chocolate mousse- like appearance!   It
smelled right, but certainly looked wrong.  Due mainly to availability
issue, Mobil Synthetic 75W-90 gear oil was
installed...........and..........voila.........MUCH improved shifting!
It's still a little notchy, but almost like getting a $40 re-synchro
job!

I'm sure any new oil would have helped, and any brand synthetic superior
to dino-lube.    My point is that if you experience any noise or paper
synchro syndrome, the most economical and convenient 'remedy' would be
to try replacing the gearbox lube.   I had great results.
