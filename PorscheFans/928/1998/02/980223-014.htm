Just wanted to respond to this from experience.  In theory it sounds
good that if the PO doesn't have service records he/she is "trying to
hide something."  However, that is not the case most of the time.  There
are a lot of people out there (I know none are on this list), who don't
keep receipts and don't care about turning over service records when
they sell their car.  How many times has someone on this list traded a
car (be it Toyota, Porsche, etc) and not handed over service records? 
And don't say it doesn't matter on "cheaper" cars, $10K is a lot of
money to some.  And also keep in mind that 928's are no longer $70K
cars.  Unfortunately some sell for less than new Saturns - which brings
in a whole new "class" of owner.  Some of which don't keep paperwork.
Then there are others who just don't think about it.  Then there's
people like me who keep everything in a three ring binder.  However, the
last two Ferraris that I have sold to a customer ( a 348 w/ 7K miles and
an 87 Testarossa) had NO records at all.  The cars have not caused the
owners one bit of trouble.  So what I'm saying is that yes service
records are important, but not everything.  If they aren't available on
a marginal car, pass on it.  But don't pass on a deal on a car that has
low, low miles, and / or is in excellent shape just because the PO may
have been disorganized.  If I had a fire in my office and my records
were lost would any of you buy my 928 or 930??

Food for thought.
