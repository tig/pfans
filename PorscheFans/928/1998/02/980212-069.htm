I'm wondering how much "looseness" is due to bolts backing out, and how 
much may be due to gasket shrinkage. Just what kind of gasket is used 
for the crankcase pan?

As I recal, the bottom half of the block (split at the crankshaft 
bearings) is assembled with a liquid gasket for minimal thickness 
variation when its critical for the bearings. Is similar used for the 
bottom pan, or a traditional felt gasket?

Has anybody wired these bolts and run a few years before rechecking? If 
a wired bolt loosens then the problem is in the gasket.
