David,

Thought I would respond to your post about Falkens.  We had a customer
recently who had Falkens on her '80 928 and was so unhappy with the road
noise she "turned them in" for some Michelins, which are much better. 
She said she felt like she was driving a truck.  Luckily the place she
bought them from was willing to exchange them for full credit.

I'm not sure if they were the same model, Ziex, as you are looking at,
but they were in that price range, so probably the same.

Anyway, for what it's worth...
