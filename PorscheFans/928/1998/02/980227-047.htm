I can think of a couple of places on tracks where I tend to hit
the stops - they are both transitions to/from an oval to a road
course - but it never happens to  me on the street. However, I
try not to push very hard on the street either. The fact that
your '90 did the same thing makes me think that the Michigan
roads must be sensationally bad!

My car needs new shocks, and I've been contemplating stiffer
springs also. This would be the time to do it, since there
wouldn't be any extra labor. One disadvantage is that the
Devek setup also lowers the car some, and it's not like
there's excess clearance under there now.
