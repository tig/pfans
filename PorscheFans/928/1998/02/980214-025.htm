The S4 has a connection for a special Bosh tool that does exactly this.
It is worth ~$5,000(and people thought the belt indicator was
expansive).

I think some of the diagnostic can be done with an oscilloscope, but
those arn't cheap either.
I wish the diagnostic was like my honda's, short a jumper and count the
blinks.

Does the S4 electronic display display any error code (I have not
encountered these, but
not look for them closely, in the service manuals).

Do you want a black 87 S4??
