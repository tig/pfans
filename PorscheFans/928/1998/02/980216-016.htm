Guys,

Just how much oil is a 73K miles 91 S4 expected to get through?

I bought the car with about 69K on it and I've had to top it up twice as 
the lovely animated display warned me of impending engine seizure (not 
really - just warned me the level was on minimum).

Do 928s burn a lot of oil?  I've only had 944s before, but their oil 
consumption was negligible.

I don't think I've got a leak, the driveway is clear, but as it's gravel 
it's difficult to be sure.

On another matter, the car was up on the lift the other day having the 
front tyres replaced (I'd recommend Micheldever tyres to UK people BTW), 
and I got to see underneath the beast for the first time.  Frightening!  
What are all those louvre vents and ducts for anyway?  And should I be 
worried about a gearbox/diff which is oily to the touch?

Anyone?

Dan.
