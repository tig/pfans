Ahhh, the $92,800 question.  

....and the answer is...I don't know.

The conductive grease I used is from a tube that just happened to fall into
my tool box when I was working as a co-op student at GE.  They used it to
prevent corrosion in connections between large aluminum bus bars that
carried thousands of amps.  I have also used it on battery terminals and
the terminals look like new when I recycle the battery years later.  The
tube has absolutely no markings on it but I have heard that most electrical
supply stores that sell mainly to electrical contractors would have
something similar.
