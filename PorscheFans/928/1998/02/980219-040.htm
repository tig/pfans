Patrick:    Lets hear alot more about your 6.5 liter 79 928.  Who and how=

did you do it?
(isnt the 79 only a 4.4 L stock???)  Stroker, bore, pistons.    What the
torque and HP?
General question, can the stock 928s 84  4.7liter motor be bored out to t=
he
S4 5 liter size ??
The strokes are all the same for all 928's, is the block different for th=
e
s4?

West coast 928 sharkys.   Im fired up that we will have a showing at Sear=
s
Point!!
Maybe we should set up camp in big circle.
March 14, see you all there.   Will be the most fun you have ever had ( A=
nd
I have done Most  everything )

Shifter hight:     Ive been through this with my 84.   Man, what was Dr
Porsche thinking with the
length of that shifter.  (out of control tall)   You have to cut about an=

Inch or two with a power hack saw,
and then match the notch of the part you cut off to fit into the rubber
mating housing shifter nob,covered with leather.   It should push right o=
n
and lock into position.  What a difference.
the car is already a pain to shift because of the long throw, now it shif=
ts
like a S4 or 944.
Best thing ( of many) i ever did.!!!!
