On my 1983S, I found that there is a box that after so many miles turns on a
reminder light (AKA. idiot light) for EGR service.  On my car, the box is on
the passenger side, right beside the seat, under a carpeted panel.  There
are two thumb screws.  In the box, there was a failed vinyl gear, which
allowed the incessant clicking.  If your box clicks, too, take a look
inside.  You will likely find this problem.  If you click, you're broken.
These things were built to be quiet unless they have failed.  (source: ME,
self-proclaimed expert after having been driven crazy with the clicking.)

I made a professional decision to disconnect the bloody clicker, and let
life go on.

My disclaimer:  you (and I) will surely be flamed for disconnecting this
box, because some will say it serves some other very important function.
Long and short of it, is that I have done it and all has been well for half
a year.  Maybe I should consider that my Oxygen Sensor is due for
replacement.

Could be a pebble. . .or a nail !

Good luck - and stay away from "those" mushrooms,  and make all your friends
pronounce the "e" at the end of Porsche.
