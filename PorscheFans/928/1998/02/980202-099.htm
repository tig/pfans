Hi all,

Thought I'd share some notes from a recent trip I took with the 928.  Some
background:  my car is a 1984 928S 5-spd; she currently has somewhat over
176,000 miles on her.  I've had some problems in the past with idle speed,
brakes, and clutch, but all were fixable with time and money.

Departed LA (that's Los Angeles, not Louisiana) to New Mexico (a little
town called Las Cruces, near El Paso, TX) for family.  Then on to
Albuquerque for business.  Then on to Las Vegas for pleasure, and finally
back to LA.  Grand total of about 2,100 miles in 11 days.  Used 1/2 quart
of oil.  Temperature variations of a high of 70 degrees in California to 20
degrees in New Mexico.  Speeds of about 80 MPH average (Speed limit on I-10
from CA-AZ border to NM-TX border is 75 so everyone goes about 80).  Before
you remind me that the 928 *can* go faster, please note that the state
police use radar in NM, AZ and Nevada and I don't need any more tickets!

The car was great!  No headaches, no emergencies, and no need to fix
anything.  Period.  Nada!  Absolutely great experience!!!

For those of you worrying about high mileage 928's, take it from me that a
well-maintained 928 will hang in there for a long time!

Some interesting facts/experiences....

If you like steaks, and you're ever near El Paso or Las Cruces, go to a
restaurant called "State Line" (it's right on the New Mexico/Texas state
line) just off Interstate 10.  Order the tenderloin and their home baked
bread.  Oh boy!!!!  

In Albuquerque the temperature at night was around 20 degrees.  This gave
me a new crack in my dashboard to match the one I got in cold weather at
Mammoth Mountain a few years back.  It also gave me the smoothest running
transmission I've ever felt in this car!!!  As with many 5-speeds, my
synchros are not as great as they could be (speed shifting is *not* a good
idea for me).  Well, when I headed out with that stone cold tranny, she
shifted better than I've ever felt before.  Wonder if I should change my
gear oil again and go to a more viscuous (sp?) fluid.  Right now I'm
running Red Line 75W90.

When I was crossing the Hoover dam on the approach to Las Vegas I heard a
hell of a squeaking bounced back from the mountain side.  Next morning I
took the car to (shudder) a Ford-Porsche dealer, expecting the worst.  Boy
was I pleasantly surprised.  The Porsche mechanic, Mike, was absolutely
super!  They have better Porsche expertise than the local Porsche
dealership here in LA.  Well organized shop, tools hung on the wall and
labeled clearly, clean as a whistle.  There were 2 other 928's in for
service and other miscellaneous Porsches scattered around.  The squeal was
a dry seal on the front wheel bearing... fixed in a jiffy and we spent a
little while under the car just inspecting and talking shop.  If you're in
Las Vegas and need help on your car, try Gaudin Ford Porsche (and they cost
about 60% of what I pay per hour in a comparable dealership in LA).

Speaking of Las Vegas, it's gotten a lot bigger, brighter, fancier, etc.
The New York New York casino/hotel is something to see!!!  Especially the
roller coaster (nope, didn't have the nerve to try it).  The battle between
two sailing ships at Treasure Island is lots of fun, as are the Tigers and
the volcano at the Mirage.  And lots of pretty show girls and great acts at
the various casinos.  You can bungee jump from a platform about 10 or 15
stories high (nope, didn't do that either).

Cruise control sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.  From LA to Tucson, it
didn't.  From Tucson thru the rest of the trip it worked great.  Go figure.

Anyway, I had a great trip, enjoyed the heck out of the drive, and couldn't
be happier with the car's performance (may the gods of 928's keep smiling
on me...).

By the way, I'm not associated with any of the above restaurants, Ford
dealerships, casinos, or anything else.  Just passing along what I learned.
