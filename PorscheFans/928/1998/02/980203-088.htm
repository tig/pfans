Some weeks (months ?) ago there was a brief thread about tails holding
water. Specifically - the tail light housings seeming to work as well
as a large bag of desiccant at sucking up and retaining water.

Today, after washing the Beast, while drying I noticed that it was
impossible to to get the rear dry because water was pooling beneath
the rear light housings and then dribbling down the rear.  A little
later as I was removing the battery for storage I noticed water drops
IN the rear compartment near the lights.

I use only a minimum of water pressure when I rinse. It was not me
with the fire hose shooting water into the tail lights; They just suck
the water in by themselves with a minimum of help.

OK. So, everybody, knows this.  Why am I posting?

There is a lot of electrical stuff back there.  It's not supposed to
be wet!

Has anyone found a way of sealing the tail light housings so that they
keep water out rather than sucking it in?
