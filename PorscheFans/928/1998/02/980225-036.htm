Danger, Will Robinson! The belt tension sensor has been known to cry wolf
now and then, but it has also been known to give valid early warning of a
low tension situation. One scenario I've experienced and heard about from
others is to go for a long, hard drive and then see the light come on. Stop
the engine, restart, and the light's off, but comes on a while later. For
me, this was the real thing, and a visit to the shop showed the belt just
getting out of spec and well deserving of adjustment.

I've also seen the indicator come on while I'm just rolling normally down
the interstate. Stop engine, restart, and the light's off and stays off.
Isolated events like this appear not to mean anything serious, and I'd
rather have an occasional false positive as long as I get the real ones as
well.

I strongly suggest you reconnect that sensor and make sure it's working
properly.
