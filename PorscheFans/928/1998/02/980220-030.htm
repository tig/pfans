	[snip]
	        My problem is that it will start up PERFECT (like it is
running off
	of gas from the cold start valve) but after it has substained
ignition for
	about 2 seconds it will fall to just below idle and will not rev
up.  From
	there the idel will become increasingly lower and subsiquently
rougher, it
	won't usually stall unless you step on the gas pedal.  

	        I've changed all the filters, oil, air, fuel ect. and
have flushed
	and spray tested the injectors, checked to make shure both pumps
are running
	and pumping.

	        I suspect the fault to exist either in the fuel pressure
regulator
	at the head of the block, or perhaps in the air flow meter.  I
did however
	notice that my pressure regulator will NOT hold a vacume threw
the line that
	enters threw the top of the regulator.  But because of the 928
manuals
	veigness in the actual fuel delivery system in the CIS I'm
having dificulty
	asertaining what is the culprit.

	????Can anyone lend some advise????

	J Renfrew

	First thing that I would check are fuel pressures.  There are
three types of pressure: system, control and residual pressure.  The
system pressure is the total fuel pump pressure when running constantly.
This is very important in a CIS system.  Control pressure is metered at
the fuel plunger.  The warm-up regulator play a role in the control
pressure as well.  The residual pressure is maintained by the fuel
accumulator after engine shutdown.  A properly working fuel accumulator
allows easy startup when engine is warm.

	Verify these before you do anything else.
