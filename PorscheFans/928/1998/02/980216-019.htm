Turns out to be a *very* late '84 (serial number 3049) with a few options (158
Radio, 438 Comfort Right Seat, 490 HiFi soundsystem, 494 2 speakers on back
shelf/amplifier system, 533 Alarm system, 650 Sunroof) and a lot of things that
must have been standard that year (power windows) and a few unlisted oddities,
such as tinted windows, an odd paintjob (the doorpiller says it is
"preussischblaumetalic", but it is a silvery-purple with silver edging) and
matching (light) purple leather interior.

It started and ran fine, it felt pretty good during the (short) drive around
the building (no tags).   Shifting was miminal under the circumstances, but the
automatic felt fine with what it got to do, braking good but with some
sussuruss (but it has been sitting for a few months, so I'm not surprised.)  No
real chance to test it yet.

It has a number of small faults (wear on the drivers seat, though it was
comfortable enough, missing air vent vanes, loose ash tray, needs to be
cleaned, etc.) and three major ones 1) a truck rolled into the right rear,
which now needs some body work, 2) the power steering unit leaks and 3) the
speedometer doesn't work, and the indicated milage is slightly over 52K.  The
last worries me, as this leaves me with no idea how close we are to the 60K
belt replacement.

I've been assured that they can get me the maint. records, though they don't
know how quickly, and they don't have a problem driving it over to the mechanic
of my choice (thanks to Carl Anderson, on the list, for the recommendation of
one) so that is definately the next step.

What are 'fair' '84s going for?  (Maybe I'm being generous, it may only rank as
a beater, especially if the milage is way off.)  I can't find anything online,
and the while I've got some feel for what '86-'87 models are going for, this
one is a couple of steps down from that.  And then there is the question of how
much the *known* stuff is going to cost to fix...
