 In regard to the posting by Howard Post concerning his flood status and
the
intentional leaving behind of his "95 Cat" which he could not "care less
about", it has always been my contention that Porsche owners are
slightly
higher on the evolutionary scale. Mr. Post obviously has no regard for
the
life of an animal which depended upon him for sustanance and it's very
survival. To this I surmise that if we cannot care for the welfare of a
pet
who has come to depend upon and trust us, then how can we care fully for
an
inanimate piece of machinery..?
If I found myself in the same predicament, I assure you that I would
leave mr.
Post wet, hungry, and frightened.
To Mr. Post; You Sir, are a moron.

Don't you think you're overreacting?  Cats are a hell of a lot more
durable and resourceful than you would think.  Don't you guys hate the
way they cannot resist getting on cars and putting those damn paw print
sliding scratches (very evident on black cars).
