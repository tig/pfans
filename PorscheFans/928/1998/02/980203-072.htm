Hi John, my owner's manual (83) calls for 87 octane (low grade gas) and
I've noticed Imparts ad in Panorama for Techron which says "Porsche
recommends Techron".  I know BMW does too.  So based on these factors I
use Chevron regular (contains aforementioned techronian chemistry
experiment additive) which is 85 cents a gallon here in Atlanta, for
which I am indeed thankful.

Speaking of the products of the Bavarian Motorworks featuring great
handling married to questionable electronics and other problems, I have
heard that the 4 litre V8 found in 540/740/840 cars originally featured
unlined (aluminum) cylinder walls which were plagued with problems.  Has
anyone heard that the BMW V8's cylinder walls are now iron sleeved and
the previous ones are being recalled?  What an avoidable scenario, as
the 70's designed 928 V8 avoided these frictional diasters through high
silicone content in the aluminum (pretty sure I'm right here too, feel
free to comment anyone).

blk 83 5 speed I've spent so much I hope to build a living room around
it
