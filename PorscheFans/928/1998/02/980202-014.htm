Andy already recommended resetting the controller and that should be
your 
first step.

Next, you should check how your sensors were disconnected.  They work by 
wearing out a wire until the circuit becomes open.  Maybe one of the
detector
is worn off or one of the "disconnected" sensor (normally, to eliminate
this
system, people just put a jumper wire inside the detector's plug).  If
the
jumper has fallen off or became loose, your system would think that you
have a worn out pad.

If this is not the problem, I think that you should check the brake
fluid level
(well you should anyway) because there is a level detector in the
reservoir and
I think there is not a seperate ligth to indicate low level.
