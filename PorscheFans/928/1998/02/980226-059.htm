Once again the debate on the color rages on...

I called Mr Paterk (spelling)  he is listed in the Panorama magazine as the
paint and body expert in the tech section.  called him and he knew right away
what the color was.  Unfortunately I dont remember what it is, something like
zurmatt , zemuratt  , zermatt silver.  It was a body color used on early 80s
944.  But it was applied without a protective clear  coat on the intake
runners to give an aluminum feel to the intake.  without the clear coat the
paint deteriorated, especially if a detail shop aplied one of their products,
it would turn brown.  Look inder the rubber sleeves and you will see a silver
with a goldish, bronze tinge.

This is exactly how the sample in the book I saw looked like.  It does look
like silver, but when compared to something that is  actually is silver, you
can see the gold.

The color exsits, the paint shop I used was very high end and did lambo,
porsche, maserati etc restorations and repaints.  He had the industry sample
books!

I had the intake and v covers blasted by an aviation shop, conversion coated
to stabilize the magnesium.  The paint shop used a light acid etch primer and
painted with an epoxy based paint of the color in question.

The metal is very porous and the result reflected this.  The factory paint was
very thick and covered this coarseness.  To avoid peeling of the paint like
the factory (from heat cycling?), we opted for a light coat.  The finish was
very durable.  slipped wrenches and screwdrivers didnt do anything to chip or
mar the surface.

Blasting and treating at aviation shop in Tulsa ( valve covers , runners, oil
spout)
$325

Prime and paint and was carefully wrapped in bubble wrap by proffesional paint
shop  $225

My busted knuckles and TLC   $0

This all looks expensive, but the result was very good, only have the best do
the work.  I  used the aviation shop because they work with magnesium and
expensive parts on a daily basis and had the process to stabilize the
magnesium.  These may never need to be painted again.

A lot of time was involved because the valve covers have webbing on the inside
that was time consuming to blast and paint, I got my moneys worth!!!
