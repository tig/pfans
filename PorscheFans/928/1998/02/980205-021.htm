I found this (and a lot of other very interesting conversation) at
www.pacific.net/~arroyo/messages/3278.htm

>>2) There can be no doubt that a properly prepared 928 can
compete on the track with any other Porsche. Mark Anderson's
6.4 litre 928 is proof of that. And Tilo Steurer has just completed a 6.0
litre,
compression reduced, Vortech S-Trim (@ only 9 lbs.) supercharged 928
with Electromotive engine mgmt., which must put out around 600 hp and
God knows how much torque. If his car has been lightened to the 2700 or
so lbs. that a race prepped 928 should weigh, it should outrun just about
any 951T. And if you had a 6.0 litre R-Trim supercharged, properly
intercooled 928 with Motec, you'd be looking at an easy, reliable 1000 hp.
If the transaxle could be beefed up to handle the power (the stock unit is
supposedly only good to 700 hp), and could put enough rubber on the
ground to get the power down, I think even Martin Snow in his turbo would
be watching the back end of such a 928 pull away on the track. <<
