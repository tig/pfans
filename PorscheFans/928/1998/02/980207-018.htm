Hey y'all...

I have been a lurker on this list for just a short while, and I have
found everyone here to be very friendly and knowledgeable. Now that the
time has finally come for me to request some information, I'm hoping to
get some informative and helpful replies. :-)

Oh, and since I don't always have time to weed through all the messages
here, please direct any replies to my email address directly at:
idratherbedriving@unforgettable.com -Thanx! :-)

First off, I do not own a 928. I drive an Acura 2.2CL. ...However, my
2-year lease is up this coming October, and I will need a new car. I
have given serious consideration to several cars in the $10-$15K range,
including:

1) '87-'88 Porsche 928-S4, (the average asking price here in L.A. seems
to be around $12-16K)

2) '91-'92 Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo (the average asking price here in
L.A. seems to be around $11-15K)

3) '93 Mazda RX-7 Twin Turbo (the average asking price here in L.A.
seems to be around $14-18K)

What I need here is some friendly advice from people in the know, as I
am torn between these three cars. I realize that all three are expensive

to maintain and insure, and I must admit that I know far more about the
Nissan than either the Porsche or the Mazda.  If anyone has any advice
for me (aside from one-line replies saying "just get the 928 dude, it's
cooler!"), I would very much appreciate it.

I am interested in finding out everything there is to know about all
three cars, and I have already done so (to some extent) with the
300ZXTT. This is my attempt to find out all there is to know about the
'87-'88 928-S4. I'm soliciting your expert advice pertaining to stuff
like the following:

1) What to look for in terms of purchasing one...
        -signs of potential problems
        -how to tell a "good" car from a "bad one" with a few quick
glances (if possible)
        -common problems -how to find out whether or not they have been
fixed
        -important recalls and TSBs -how to find out whether or not they

have been
         performed
        -anything (telltale or otherwise) I should keep my eyes open for

2) General thoughts about which car I am better off with for in long run

3) Why I should buy a 928-S4 instead of the other two (constructive
thoughts)

4) Is there any reason why I might not want to buy the 928-S4?

5) Can I reasonably expect to purchase one (here in the L.A. area) in
relatively good shape for around $13,000.00+/?

I must admit that the 928-S4 is probably my favorite of the above three
cars in terms of style, functionality, etc.  I have long been a fan of
the car, and I have always wanted one. Now that it's looking like I
might finally purchase one, I figured it's high time to educate myself
as comprehensively as possible. :-)

....Again, please send your replies directly to my email address to
ensure that I'll receive it. If you see fit, feel free to cc the list
too. ...That's totally up to you of course. :-)

Thanx in advance for your all help with this. :-)

~Matt
