Hi all,

A couple of days ago I lost all power assist on my 87 5spd.(79k miles)
the obvious (belt, fluid level)
were OK. I suspect the pump gave out. Occasionally prior to the failure
there would be a moaning
noise during steering specially when cold. I took the car to the local
shop were they believe
that it is the PS pump, but they were concerned about glittering
particles floating in the PS fluid
reservoir these particles looked like dust. The mechanics did not want
to elaborate on whether the
rack seals might be damaged.

Finally my questions:

1- Has anyone on this list replaced a pump and if so is there anything I
should look out for.

2- Is replacing the PS pump relatively easy (I do have the service
manuals and it appears easy)?
    This would be my first "real" repair on this car.

3- What do you guys/gals think of the steering rack. Is it likely to be
damaged?

4- The mechanics mention that the PS fluid should be flushed. How does
one go about
    doing this considering the high pressure involved.

5- Any other suggestions.
