>how to tell an S4 from a GT?  Specifically a 1990 model 928?

First, the obvious. Is the transmission manual? If so, and it's a US car
(JAO or JBO rather than ZZZ in the VIN), then it's highly unlikely to be an
S4.

However, there is at least one easy check. Look at the engine number
(stamped on a horizontal, upward-facing surface on the top front of the
block, a little left of center, but right of the dipstick; open the hood,
use a flashlight, and, if all else fails, follow the picture in the owner's
manual). It will have two rows, the top of which is the engine model
designation. A GT engine will say "M28/47", a stick S4 "M28/41", and an
automatic S4 "M28/42".

The second row is the engine number. For a 1990 GT, this will have the form
85Lxxxxx. For a 1990 S4, it will be 81Lxxxxx.

Neither of these is dependable for this purpose.

The M-code 639 means the car is a GT. However, lots (speaking relatively,
of course) of real GTs have no such M-code.

You have my sympathy.
