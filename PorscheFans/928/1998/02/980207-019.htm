So, I was getting a bit of wind noise in the "cockpit" at speed.  When
I took a close look at the car, I noticed that the driver's door was
not quite flush with the rear quarter panel.  Having dealt with
settling door hinges and drying weatherstripping in the same area on
my prior porsche, I thought "hey, I can handle this one".  I went
down, got an allen wrench, and moved the post for the door latch a
smidge farther inboard.  This worked well for a couple of days with
only nominally (so I thought) greater effort to seat the door when
getting in and out.
Now, however, I can't get in from the outside!  The inside pull latch
still works, and with the door open I can see that the door handle
does actuate part of the latch mechanism.  Apparently not all of the
right parts however?
Does anyone have any information on how to procede without sending
springs 'n clips 'n shims flying out all over the driveway? Ingress
and egress via the passenger door is going to be rough on the
upholstery.  THanks!
