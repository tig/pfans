When I wrote on this before, I felt that the answers were along the 
lines of "of course it's Year 2000 compliant, it's a car" rather than 
informed knowledge. Knowing that some Fords and the Renault Megane 
would have problems, I wrote to Porsche Cars GB.

Their reply is "Having now had the opportunity of discussing this with 
our technical department we would suggest that at present there are no 
known problem areas which give cause for concern in this matter. 
However, within the next few months a member of our technical team 
will be visiting Porsche Ag, the manufacturer to discuss this matter 
further with regard to all Porsche models and their compliance for the 
year 2000.

"Once this meeting is concluded should any technical details need to 
be passed on to Porsche owners the appropriate steps will be taken to 
ensure that all Official Porsche Centres are communicated the relevant 
information"
