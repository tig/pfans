I had exactly the same problem with my '85 (115k Mi).  I replaced the idle
regulator and it helped but did not completely fix the problem.
Exasperated, I took the car to my mechanic.  After a couple of minutes, he
commented that the idle speed was a little low so he turned it up to spec
and the problem completely disappeared.  It's been running perfect ever
since (over a year).
