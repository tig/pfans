Invitation to Porsche-Travel Mille Miglia Travel 98
The deadline is February  the 15th. 1998.

Dear Porsche-Friends,

Mille Miglia Travel 98 together with Travel Agency Rampinini, Como have
worked out a package for a Porsche-Friends group to travel to the Mille
Miglia in May 1998 (the Mille Miglia runs from May 14th to 17th 1998,
the
Start/Finish is in Brescia Italy).
It is one of worlds most historic road races, running through
breathtaking
Northern Italy and is unique in fact that you can drive (not race) on
the
same roads as the competitors, while the event takes place.
It is the intention of a group of PorscheFansEurope from various
European
countries to travel to this event. The various National groups will
assemble
in their own countries and travel to Italy in convoy. We will arrange
interesting stops along the way and arrange to meet up with European
Club
members (whether they are or are not travelling to the Mille Miglia )
along
the way.

THE ACTUAL MILLE MIGLIA ITINARY IS AS FOLLOWS:
The Porsche-Friends will meet together on the afternoon of May 13th for
the
first time in Como (Italy), at the Hotel Como. We will sort our Porsches
into driving groups of up to 5 cars each, out of our MAXIMUM of 15 cars.
Each group being led by an experienced Porsche-Friend. Each group can
make
their own routes/timetable for the trip period or use the route
suggested.
After this there is time to get to know one another, talk about Porsches
etc, have dinner and overnight there.
On morning of May 14th we all drive to Brescia, there we can look the
race
cars and experience the atmosphere of the event as they prepare to run
the
Mille Miglia. Early on evening we drive to a restaurant nearby the
route.
There we have dinner and await for the first participants, when they
have
passed us, we drive within the field to Ferrara, then to Minerbio where
our
hotel is (30km away from Ferrara).
On May 15th, we follow the field on the official route in two or three
groups (max. 5 cars each) via Ravenna-Rimini-San Marino-Gubbio-Spolento
(on
the way we pass the two most impressive sections of the Mille Miglia the
Monti Sibilini and Monte Terminillo) to the area of Rieti, there we take
a
short cut from the original race route to Soirano nel Cimino. It is
nearby
Viterbo where our hotel is located. We could then enjoy the pool and a
dine
on a meal typical of the region.
On May 16th, we meet the Oldtimer at Viterbo after short drive. We drive
within the race field north through the Toskana via Montefiasione, Siena
to
Florenz. We pass Florenz before the Oldtimer competitors to arrive
earlier
at the most impressive points of the 3rd day (the Futa and the Raticosa
Pass). On the late afternoon we arrive at our hotel in Bologna and after
our
farewell Dinner we will have drinks at the hotel bar.
On May 17th there is set no program. Everybody can do whatever they
want.
Some may wish to set off and go directly home but some of us will make a
little Detour on the way back to the Ferrari exhibition in Modena.
