I hope you are not serious.  This is a joke right?  No 951 from what I've
read on the 944 list can put out this kind of power without spending HUGE
amounts of money and reliability would be $#!+.  You could make yourself =
a
6 liter 928 cheaper and get more power and more importantly, useable
torque.  No one in their right mind would bastardize a 928 with a
4-cylinder 944 engine.

Out of 2.5 liters or even 2.8 or 3.0?  NO WAY.  Make them put that in
writing.  A 993 TT can put out this kind of power but it takes a $20K mod
to do it and that engine is a lot larger displacement with superior
breathing  characteristics, 6 cylinders, etc.
