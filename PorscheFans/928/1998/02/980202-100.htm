Since the speedometer is working, it should definitly be a problem at the
inst. cluster itself right? I am going to remove the cluster tommorow and take
a look.

 Hi
 I have had the non or part time odometer problem on two or three VDO
 instrumented cars, Audi, VW, & MB I think. Probably because I only drive
 older cars. My problem was a plastic (nylon) gear, about 1/2 inch in
 diameter, that is pressed on the shaft that turns the odometer cylinders.
 Over time and baking in the sun, the gear shrinks and develops a small crack
 at the hub. The gear then slips on the shaft instead of turning it. This was
 on VDO units driven by a speedometer cable. I dont know how the electronic
 speedometer / odometer units operate. The odometer part may be similar.
 You've got to take it out anyway so have a look.
 
 The solution I used was to clean the gear and shaft with degreasing solvent.
 It's tough due to limited space. Use a foam Q tip like you would use tape
 head cleaning. I mixed a small amount of JB Weld epoxy and carefully applied
 it to the gear hub / shaft end. Don't let the JB Weld sag into the works!
 Let it cure and re-assemble. I never had any more trouble after the fix. I
 would also suggest cleaning and lubricating the odometer unit to be sure it
 wasn't stuck together with old grease.
 
 It's really not to difficult to remove the pod to get the speedo out. Get a
 27mm socket, 4" extension, and a long handle to remove the steering wheel, a
 long 5mm allen wrench to undo 2 bolts (nearly hidden, near front outer edges
 of the pod - underneath), and an 8 or 10mm socket to undo 2 more bolts near
 the turn signal switch unit and the pod is nearly free. This is after taking
 off the shield under the pod held on with 2 phillips headed screws, and the
 turn signal / light switch assembly. Careful to not pull the wires loose
 that go to electrical plugs that go to the instrument cluster and work it
 free of the pod starting from the right side (for left hand drive cars)
 
 Hope this helps
