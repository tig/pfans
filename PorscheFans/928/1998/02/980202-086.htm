> What is the difference between horsepower and torque?

    In this arena, torque is the rotational force generated by the
motor, and power is the amount of 'work' the motor can do.  More power
gives higher top speed (all other things being equal).  More torque
gives quicker acceleration (same proviso).
    Of particular interest when driving on the road is the amount of
torque available throughout the rev range.  This affects the ability to
accelerate without changing to a lower gear.  [The gearbox and final
drive act as torque multipliers, excepting 'overdrive' or 'direct' gear
ratios.]  Race cars typically have very little torque until high revs,
making them painful (or interesting) to drive on the street.
    The 1987 S4 (for example) has a great deal of torque available over
a wide rev range; at least 300 lb feet from 2,700 rpm to 4,750 rpm.  It
was the flexibility given by this breadth of torque that was the big
improvement from the European S2, motor, the increase in power being a
modest 10hp.
    There was a wonderful post to the list some weeks ago giving the
precise relationship between torque and power.
    Whether Torque or Power is better, depends on what you're intending
to do.   Extractors will often give more power and more torque, both at
the top end, while sacrificing some low-end torque to accomplish this.
There is no free lunch.  [Unless you believe Devek's claims for
advancing the valve timing on S4's.]
    Generally speaking, more mid-range torque will make for easier
driving;  more power will get you more impressive speeding tickets.
    Phew!
