	The cam seals are not hard, but you gotta have patience and a little
	trick is involved.   There is a rubber O-ring that sits in a groove of
	the cam cover (the aluminum piece bolted to the front of the cam
	housings in which the larger diameter cam seal resides) and slips over
	the camshaft   In other words, there is the relatively large seal that's
	easily installed - but there is also a very small rubber seal that is a
	challenge.

There is a neophrene washer about the size of a dime within an oil galley on the left side
cam cover.  I hope you replaced it and while doing so, put some sealant on both side of
it.  This area is a major oil leak source.  When it leaks, it gives the impression that
you have a leaky cam seal.  Cost about $1.50 from the dealer.
