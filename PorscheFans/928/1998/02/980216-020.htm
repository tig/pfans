Here's yet another question for y'all:

I'm putting new Koni shocks in the front of my '83 S, and want to update 
to the adjustable height capability.  I'd like to lower my car just a 
wee little bit...

(Yes I've followed ALL the discussions about lowering the car, I know 
how to check for the ride height, and I just don't want to get into that 
discussion again.  Anyway, I just don't like the large gap I have 
between the wheel top and fender.  The front of my car seems to sit a 
bit higher than others I've checked.)

Anyway, here's the problem:

I got a used set of the adjustable collars and the spring perch.  When I 
set the threaded collar to it's LOWEST setting, put it on the new shock, 
and place the spring perch on top,  The perch ends up being 3/4" HIGHER 
than the perch on my original Boge shock!  I don't see any way to even 
get it to the SAME height as my original, let alone get it any LOWER!  
Am I missing something here?

The "new" spring perches I got are EXACTLY the same as my old ones, 
should they be different to let the spring sit lower?  Do I have the 
wrong ones?  Do cars that come with this set-up have shorter springs?  
Do I need those too?  I was told that there's only one Koni shock # 
listed for all years, so I guess it's not a matter of having the wrong 
shock?  I'm sooo confused...  HELP!  (Please)
