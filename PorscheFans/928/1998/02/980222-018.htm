David,
In 91-95 they changed the "mushroom cap" type knob to a nice fat (shaped
like a momo but even bigger) shifter knob that is great. I agree with you
about the older factory shift knob, take a look at one of the 90's cars and
you might be surprised. I have the later style on my 89's and they are
great.

Lets not try to judge Porsche by comparing their 80's cars to other's 90
car's. Even though some manufacturers are just now catching up with
Porsche's 1977 technology (ala Corvette C-5 versus 77 928).


P.S. David, don't be jealous of my 3 5-speed's because the 79 is for sale,
of course I do have my eye on 2 more 5-speed's. I am working on a different
color for each day of the week ;- )
