The Kiwi thing is something I didnt think of. I used 'Armour All' on 
mine and it worked like a charm... Of course after I did that I took 
the car to get painted and have a different spoiler put on but thats 
a different spoiler.

Anyone want to buy an S-Spoiler? It may not be original, it doesnt 
say porsche on it, and my car is a 78' so its not supposed to have 
one anyway right? But its complete and in excellent condition, 3 
pieces. It has the little strips that run up the sides of the rear 
hatch about 3/4 of the way.. I'll probably just trade it to my local 
dismantler for one of the interior bits that I need but I just 
thought to ask if anyone wanted it.
