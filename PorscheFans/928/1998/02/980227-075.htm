rear quarter panel to access it.

Thanks Vince, I knew I was missing some somewhere.

Have you done this, or do you know if it can be done correctly the first time
without adjusting/checking till it's right? Or can it be adjusted while in
operation?

Still waiting for parts.....Ignition wires, dist. caps and rotors, oxygen
sensor, shift cup, shift rod coupling bushings,
manifold to converter gaskets, and rubber exhaust hanger. 
Since I sorta got all this oxygen sensor stuff started I'll be sure to let you
all know if I can tell or measure a difference. Hopefully, between it and the
tune-up items, I'll get over my feelings of being down on power of late.
I still can't believe it doesn't miss with that # 2 wire showing infinite
resistance..... weird.

Oh, this may interest some of you..... I ordered the shift cup with these
other parts, and subsequently ordered bushings for the shift rod coupling in
the rear also, as, after inspection, I found that 3/4 of the play is in the
rear coupling, not at the front shifter cup. So you guys may want to check
yours. I'm replacing both, but YMMV.
You can take off the shifter and boots and see where the play is
easily.....(front or rear rod)
FWIW, my shifter play fore/aft feels fine.....just like anyone else's who'd
think theirs was fine, but believe me, it's definitely not "as-new" and will
be much better with the new components. If you don't believe me, (not that I
have a propensity to lie or exaggerate) pull your shifter and boots, notice
the play, then hold the rod with the most play while you move the shifter and
you can see how much difference it will make. 
Got the car up, and exhaust off.....come on UPS man!  (probably early next
week)

starting to show signs of tanning.    :-(
