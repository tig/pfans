Does anyone out there get the factory magazine Christophorus?  We got
our January issue today and it has a funny article about a German TV
producer that staged a "flying 928" stunt as a birthday present for his
boss (who drives a 928), with the cooperation of Porsche's director of
PR.  

Here's a quote:

"The stunt producer left nothing to chance.  When the 928 grazed the
bridge's parapet during the first attempt at 105 mph, he revved up the
second 928 to 115 mph.  The result was a perfect flight.  It was
incredible to see how the car - which is usually known for its good grip
on the road - went sailing through the air."

Don't think it would be a good idea to scan the article and put it on
our web site, but next time any of you are by here remind me to show it
to you.  The sight of a beautiful GTS (with phone dial wheels???) flying
through the air is a sight to see!  Hee hee!
