My 85 does not have ABS but did your mechanic check the ABS sensor on
each wheel?If you are not the original owner, the previous owner might
have disabled or removed
one of the sensor.

Yes it can be done.  The cheapest way is to find a good used one.

I am forwarding this message to the 928 Porschefans list.  We now have
over 1100 members,
most of them owners and all somewhat mechanically inclined.  I will ask
the list to answer
you directly and strongly suggest you give it a try, there are a lot of
nice folks that are
willing to talk about anything close the 928 subject...

No problem, not much of an answer anyway.

PS.  You should avoid using all uppercaps.  This is the equivalent of
screaming and, well,
most people don't like it.  Just when you thought that the internet was
all about abolishing
rules...
