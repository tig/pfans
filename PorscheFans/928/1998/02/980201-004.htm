Or not (tube swap)?  The sound is like a intermittent loose bearing as
opposed to a screeching bearing on a course with impending lockup. 
(Sterling what did your old tube sound like?  And I forgot was the
replacement noisy as well?)  I recall the water pump is still recent but
you should check the P-PO records.

You're right of course on my assessment of the 'rattle' - a minor
irritant when cold and in park/neutral, no noise on the move in gear. 
Call me Mad Max but I dyno'd the car (slightly better than spec using
1.2 correction figure for a/t), ran at Sear's (definately faster than
specs in the manual) and drove in general everyday for close to a year
with no change in the noise or performance.  

Still, that's me, I have faith in the build strength of the 928, felt
ultra confident with the car given it's previous history + my informal
inspection and try to be realistic about an 'older' model car.  FWIWW I
paid $9k in 1996 and started refreshing immediately with new brakes &
fluids throughout.  Of course I'd want to have everything perfect - but
I guess that is what makes these cars a labor of love.  I just couldn't
let Lucky's GT slip away even though I was S4 hunting!  That plus six
cars but only five spaces dictacted the sale.
