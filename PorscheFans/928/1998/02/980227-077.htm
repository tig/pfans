Hi

  I recently picked up some 928 prints that I've never seen before. Just
wondering if someone has seen these before. The story I got from the
person I bought them from is that they are from an ad campaign that
Porsche never put out. And these prints are actually the printer's
proofs. They all have 928 GTS models in them and they look great.
They are about 14"x 22" and have a white border with the Porsche logo

ne shows a cobleston  Oe street with German shops on the bockground and
there is the rear view of a GTS on the foreground.

  Another shot seems to be taken from the inside of an Arab bazaar and
outside on the street is a black GTS.

  There is an aerial shot of a guy holding a rope going up to the sky
and on the ground you see the shadow of a hot air ballon. He just happens
to be standing next to a beautifull silver GTS. The whole scene is shot in
this vast plain and you can see a heard of sheep on the distance.

  The last one shows a blue GTS parked in front of an old wall which looks
like it's a church, and there is a nun guiding a line of kids as one
strays behind to admire the 928.


  From the content it looks like this prints were from a worldwide campaing
and maybe they just weren't used in the USA. If anyone has seen these
before let me know.
