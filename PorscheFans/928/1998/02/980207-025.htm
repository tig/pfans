Hi all,

Speaking of flying 928's, has anyone else seen the flying 928 in the latest
issue of "Christophorus"? On page 70, it describes shooting of an episode of a
series called "An Alarm for Cobra 11". In it, a 928 has to fly across a bridge
and land on all fours. It has pictures of the flyer and states the car was
remotely steered and required the largest ramp ever erected.  The first take
had the 928 leaving at 105 mph but scraped the bridge. The second take had the
car leave at 115 mph and make a perfect flight. The car has the GTS rear
reflector setup and what look like the rear fender flares. But the wheels are
the old phone dial style. Weren't those only available in 15 inches? Certainly
not GTS material. Maybe they were stronger on impact =;-)

Speaking of flying cars and aerodynamics, man, I haven't read as much
sniveling and finger pointing since the latest Clinton scandel of the week.

I think you're all in violent agreement with each other. The difference is in
what the person is defining as "aerodynamics". One could argue that the
classical two pairs of opposing forces acting on an aircraft: lift vs.weight
and thrust vs.drag are the encompassing aerodynamic forces. One could also
argue that weight is not a first order contributor to automobile aerodynamics
since it's always reacted by an equal push from the ground. So if one defines
aerodynamics as solely lift (or downforce) vs.drag, than weight won't be a
factor. But a lighter car goes faster and speed certainly is a first order
contributor to aerodynamics. Weight (or mass) also affects how much downforce
is needed to keep the car negotiating a curve and not going straight off the
road.

So, IMHO, both camps are right. It depends on what is being defined as
aerodynamics. 

BTW, I'm a mechanical engineer and not an aerodynamicist. I'm just trying to
recall the brown bag lunchtime lectures given by the aero people to us non-
aero people during by years at McDonnell Douglas. I knew I shouldn't have
slept through those.
 
BTW, I read in the British magazine "F1 Racing" (the best one if you're a die
hard F1 fan) that the current FI cars create so much downforce and, as a
consequence, so much drag, that when the drivers lift off the gas at speed,
they experience about 1g deceleration BEFORE they apply the brakes. That was
in a column written by the head engineer at Team Tyrrell. Talk about seat belt
burn!!
