Bob,

  This is interesting.  I called them 3 weeks ago about an '89 S4 I was 
  considering and they were able to tell me where the car had been serviced 
  in addition to what they told you.  Sure enough, when I went to look at 
  the car, the stamps in the warranty booklet matched the list of service 
  locations that PCNA had given me.
  
  Congrats on your purchase!  Auto or 5-speed?
