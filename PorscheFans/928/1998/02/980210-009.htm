All the chatter about the poor cat that got left behind....well, I have two
VERY EXPENSIVE cats.  They are about as spoiled as they can be, but the also
go out at every opportunity.  I worry a lot, because we have foxes and
coyotes around, and the occasional Fisher, but my guys are woods kitties and
they know as much about what is around as possible...they are also pretty
big, which helps.

So.  When they climb on the top of my Porsche (not often left outside,
actually), or my BLACK Audi....I chuckle.  They are, afterall, merely CARS,
and can be repainted and replaced.  The cats are a part of my family, and
respond of their own rather than just to what my input is....the cars just
sit there until I DO something, like start them.

I used to subscribe to the 911 list but quit because those people have NO
sense of humor and outside of their rear-engined penis extensions, don't
have a life, I think.  I hope that this list doesn't become that way, too.

Lighten up guys...life is WAY too short to flame ANYONE on this list, except
in jest, of course!

Now, if you will excuse me, it is just past 8:30 in the morning, and the
temperature has just risen past fifteen degrees F...I need to go throw my
two cats out into the snow!
