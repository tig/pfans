Hi Dave,

I have a '90 S4, and I put the 75C thermostat from Devek in my car. Before the
change, the needle on coolant temp gauge would be parked right at or just
below the last white tick mark (210F?). After installing the thermostat, the
needle takes longer to get to its highest reading, which is about a needle
width below the 210F mark. So it runs a little cooler, which is what one would
expect since the difference in temp ratings of the stock (83C) vs. new
thermostat is about 8C. I've noticed no changes in the fuel injection system,
or anything else.

Also, just for GP, I wired the cooling air flaps open. As expected, the engine
took longer to heat up. It would still hit the same max temp as with the air
flaps opening and closing. But, the engine temperature would vary quite a bit
more than with the flaps operating normally.

Hope that helps,

John Weber
