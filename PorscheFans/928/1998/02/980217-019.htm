Gentlemen (& Ladies) - I have a problem with my driver's side power window.
A few days ago I rolled it down, it dropped about halfway and then slide
completely down into the door. On attempting to roll it up I could hear the
motor running but observed no window movement. My actions thus far have been
to remove the inner door panel where I found that the regulator arm had
popped out of the horizontal  track which is attached to the window. The
white plastic bushing which was attached to the regulator arm had broken
into three pieces. I have ordered one from my local dealer but have no idea
how to install. It appears as though it was molded onto the regulator arm at
time of manufacture. Has anyone had this problem before and if so is there a
solution other than hooking the horizontal track on the metal portion of the
regulator at the tip and running the window up and leaving it closed
permanently? Thanks in advance...
