Phil Adamson,
                     I really don't care if I or other people misspell
or use apostrophe's in the wrong way because the fact is most people are
to busy too care. If you have the time to check over all of your
message's and to correct everyone else's all the more power to you. I
however don't have the time or even care enough to bother, the most you
will get out of me is a quick spell check that's built into my e-mail.

As far as Patricks engine goes, I don't care if he puts a jet engine on
the back and screams yahooo!!!! while he goes 200 mph but I would much
rather see him keep a 928 engine because it is such a perfect balance of
power and balance (remember the perfect 50-50 weight balance?). I
respect what everyone's opinion is, I may disagree, but I respect it. 

We are not talking about Cancer or World Peace here people we are
talking about car's so don't take everything so seriously

James Brown,
1 928 
2 people mad at him and maybe more.

PS I am a Canadian not an American but its like people from Australian
and people from New Zealand there all basically the same right? :)
