OK, I think I got it....  I have an 84 928S with unknown maintenance
history, but likly NOT
lubed with synthetic oil.  If I understand the previous postings, I
should NOT switch to
a synthetic like Mobil 1 because of ....?  I assume there are different
wetting characteristics
compared to dino oil that would result in the drying of seals, gaskets,
et al?

If I wished to benefit from the initial synthetic film that is so
important during startups, is
it safe or appropriate to go with a dino/synthetic mix ?  Some sage
advice would be
appreciated, since sincerely want to keep my shark running a looong
while.
