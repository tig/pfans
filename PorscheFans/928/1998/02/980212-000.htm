Hi fellas,
I originally posted stating that the 89's got the deeper gearing (2.64 as
compared to the previous 2.20) of the euro models .....to which the replies
were.....(see above) 
So, again, according to the article in Panorama, "the 89's (as compared to
previous models) got the deeper gearing of the European versions".....and
further...... 
"All 928's have a one-to-one top gear...ring and pinion determines final drive
ratio. 
All manual transmissions with 2.75, 2.73, and 2.64 are close ratio gearboxes.
All with 2.20 and 2.26 are wide ratio gearboxes."
So, indeed, the final drive ratio was lower in 89'.....AND.....the
transmissions were close ratio gearboxes. 
So, am I now enlightened? 

Regards, 
Greg Schickel
  
PS.....Both times that Vince has posted the 928 owners list, my download only
retrieved that section of the digest. Did this happen to anyone else?
PSS.....BTW, Thanks Vince....printed it, so now I have the info. on who owns
what and the e-mail addresses I was missing.
PSSS.....don't forget the IRC on Wednesday nights!
PSSSS......just kidding......(ramblin' gene trying to rear it's ugly head
again.....:)
