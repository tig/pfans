Ken,
There is a connector plug for the belt sensor located on the right front
timing cover just above the hydraulic tensioner. Remove this plug and clean
out the connector and the plug. Also check the wire that goes from this
connector up to the wiring harness for a short or break that could cause an
intermittent loss of continuity due to engine vibrations under heavy load..
Had the same problem on my 89 S4, it fooled all of the Porsche dealer
mechanics who said it needed a new hydraulic tensioner, new pulleys, cam
sprockets, etc.,etc. to the tune of about $3500 (Kind of an odd diagnosis
since I had installed a brand new tensioner, belt, and all of the pulleys 2
weeks earlier for $800).  I found out that the connector on the front of the
right timing belt cover was dirty and corroded, cleaned connector plug, etc.
all  has been well for over a year.

There also is a Tech bulletin from Porsche that has a trouble shooting guide
for the tension sensor. I will try to find out the exact number of the Tech
Bulletin for you.

Maybe we should get an extra copy and send it to all of the Porsche
Mechanics :-)
