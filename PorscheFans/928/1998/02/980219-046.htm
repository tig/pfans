Good guess, I'd say. 

Not long ago Mark Hoverson wrote an outstanding step-by-step procedure
for pressing out and replacing these bearings on your own.  Maybe he'll
repost it.  If not, I'm sure I have it in my archives.  Might also be in
the FAQ - haven't checked lately.

Yes.  There was a follow-up to Mark's procedure (posted by David Kelly?)
pointing out that a local machine shop was able to heat and press the
bearings for $15

Well, that's another option.  Probably an expensive one.

Not using Mark's Do-It-Yourownself method.

> Could another part other than the bearing be causing this wiggle?

I doubt it.  At least not the way you describe it.  Believe me, you
don't want it to be anything else!
