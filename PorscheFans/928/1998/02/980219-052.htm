        My 78 has recently come out of a 4 year storage, and has had all of
the extended service jobs preformed in the last couple weeks in order to get
it back on the road again.  Althought I'm running into a hitch.

        My problem is that it will start up PERFECT (like it is running off
of gas from the cold start valve) but after it has substained ignition for
about 2 seconds it will fall to just below idle and will not rev up.  From
there the idel will become increasingly lower and subsiquently rougher, it
won't usually stall unless you step on the gas pedal.  

        I've changed all the filters, oil, air, fuel ect. and have flushed
and spray tested the injectors, checked to make shure both pumps are running
and pumping.

        I suspect the fault to exist either in the fuel pressure regulator
at the head of the block, or perhaps in the air flow meter.  I did however
notice that my pressure regulator will NOT hold a vacume threw the line that
enters threw the top of the regulator.  But because of the 928 manuals
veigness in the actual fuel delivery system in the CIS I'm having dificulty
asertaining what is the culprit.

????Can anyone lend some advise????
