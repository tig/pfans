I feel obligated to respond to Weasel's comments, who wrote:

	I just heard a commercial for LoJack, that car security system, on
the radio in New York today.  They were telling some story about a guy who
had his Porsche stolen even though he had the standard Porsche security
system.  I was horrified to hear them butcher the pronunciation of
Porsche.  I'd expect so much more from a company that deals with anything
automotive.  I felt obliged to drop them some email about it :)  But
regardless, has anyone had any experience with these?  I found this web
site about auto-security that suggested that any stolen car is either
wrecked or stripped for parts within hours after it is stolen so such
security devices are of little use if your car is stolen by experienced
thieves.  Of course, the dealership trying to sell me LoJack couldn't
disagree more.  I'm not sure who to believe, except that the website had
no vested interest in getting me to hold on to my money while the
dealership had interest in getting me to part with it.  Any opinions out
there?

   LoJack carefully reviews and approves all copy for radio commercials, even
if written by outside ad agencies.  LoJack cannot always review a 'local
talent's' inflection, accent, dialect, or interpretation of the copy.  In fact
national companies (LoJack is now in 15 States) often prefer the 'local
talent' to lend their own personality to the copy.  This often adds
credibility to the story.  
   Interestingly, I'm not sure LoJack would have picked up on the
mispronunciation I think you refer to, since in the New England area Porsche
is mostly expressed as (right or wrong) a single syllable word.  
   There is, unfortunately, usually some confusion about what a 'LoJack' is.
This is why the company tries to advertise using the story technique.  The
best way to understand LoJack is to listen to the ads.  
   LoJack is not an automobile security system, per se.  It is a Stolen
Vehicle Recovery System.  This means it is put to use only after the security
systems have failed, and someone has managed to successfully steal your car.  
   Actually, at this point, LoJack is pretty much out of the picture having
sold you the device and installed it in your car.  This is because the police
actually operate the system and are the only people authorized to activate and
track the stolen car.  
   Although it is true that when a car is stolen, it is often fairly quickly
stripped for parts, the success of the LoJack device is in its ability to lead
police to the car within a few hours instead of a few days.  This fast
recovery usually results in the bad guys being caught in the act as opposed to
being long gone.  

Weasel, I hope this helps you understand LoJack a little more.
