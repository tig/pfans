The insurance policy requires you to put additives in your car??  The
additive topic has been beaten thoroughly on this list and the general
concensus is DON'T use them.  Use a good 20W-50 synthetic oil in your
crankcase and synthetic ATF in the transmission.  Most of the parts of this
car that are lubricated by good oil will last several hundred thousand
miles.  However, your policy may pay off on some of the other parts of the
car.
