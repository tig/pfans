 A little "hunting" is normal with the EFI type of engines.  The hunting 
is from the system trying to maintain a perfect stoichiometric mixture 
for reduced emissions.  It is designed to get feedback from the oxygen 
sensor to accomplish this.  However, the sensor has a very nonlinear 
relationship (very steep transfer curve) as it goes through it's 
"perfect" mixture reading.  That is why the system is normally constantly 
slewing the mixture up and down tightly around this set-point.  Normally 
it should be a slight RPM undulation, also you can sometimes feel the car 
"surge" about once a second during light acceleration.  It sounds like 
you may have a bad oxygen sensor--try disconnecting it, if the problem 
goes away, that was it (the single green wire loose near the fuse-panel; 
it has a connector on it).  Else, a bad temp sensor, or air-fuel meter.  
(On CIS engines this symptom normally indicates too rich a mixture AND 
too advanced timing.)
