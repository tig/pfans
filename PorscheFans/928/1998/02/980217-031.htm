Dan,

Have you read the manual (the one that comes w/ the car, not shop manual) or
928 Performance Portfolio?  You should...it would answer many of your ???.

I think you are loosing oil from somewhere...neither of my 928's burn oil, but
the '88 was leaking from most of its motor seals on the top end of the motor.
They say GTS's burn a bit of oil, but that has not been my experience so far.
I would pull off the shroud under the car (it is there to smooth air flow and
thus give better cd) and check along the side of the motor to see if you have
any leaking gaskets, also check all of the oil pan bolts as they can get
loose.  DON'T over tighten these!  If you crush your cork oil pan gasket you
damn near have to remove the motor to replace it.  The local Porsche dealer
quoted me $700 to R&R the oil pan gasket.

Good luck.
Cheers,
James Morrison
