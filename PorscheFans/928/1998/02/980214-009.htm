        "The cheap belt tensioner (no longer available) did twist the
belt.  It
had two parts on a hinge and a spring, put the belt in the slot hold the

other part and pull the tool up till it touched the engine."

        " Now the question; if somebody on this list did
reinvent the old tool how many of us would buy it? "

Good qustion!   I know I would.   It should be quite simple to base off
the 'factory' tool.


     " Most other cars have a spring tensioner on the car!  Pry the
tensioner
back, bolt it down, replace the belt, release the tensioner then lock
it.."

The ones I've had using the design you mention were for serpentine
auxiliary drives (power steering, alternator, smog pump, etc) only.  The
example I'm most faimiliar with is the Ford 302 setup used in most of
their applications since the mid-80's.   Did some cars use this spring -
tension design for timing of the camshafts as well?


       " PAN BOLTS;  I can see the problem with using loctite, "

I doubt there's much I can add to the subject at this point, but I've
used small amounts of Permatex Blue (the stuff guaranteed against oil
leaks) on bolt threads to accomplish the task of helping keep them in
place.   The effect is to fill in the teeny voids between threads with
this mildly adhesive stuff - and that minimizes the effects of vibration
and heat cycles.   Hard to guage effectiveness, but it's cheap, easy,
and doesn't hurt a thing.
