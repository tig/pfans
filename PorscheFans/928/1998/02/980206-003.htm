Philip,
I, for one, appreciated reading your post regarding the 1981 Popular Mechanics
Million Dollar Road Test. Thanks for sacrificing your delicate typing fingers,
as it gave me a warm fuzzy feeling to read it!  This should be required
reading for anyone 
still contemplating the purchase of a 928. (perhaps when our biased opinions
regarding the 928 aren't enough to convince them, then maybe the un-biased
comments made by Phil Hill and Stirling Moss can persuade them that it's the
"smart" thing to do)  The 928 has a heart of gold, and we know that, but it's
still nice to read we're not the only ones who think so. 
I bought mine 5 or so years ago, and I must say when I first saw one, I
thought it was the most beautiful car I'd ever seen, and vowed that I'd have
one someday.
After years of reading everything I could on them, I realized that this car
has a soul to back it up it's beauty, so I guess you could say I bought mine
with my heart and my head, but believe me, either way, it will steal your
heart.
I had an older gentleman stop me at a store in southern Indiana a few weeks
ago and he mentioned it'd been a long time since he'd seen one, and then said
he always thought they were the most beautiful cars ever made......smart man!
