Be careful here. It turns out that these bolts are not supposed to be
torqued very hard (or they will squash the oil pan gasket, which then will
not spring back, leading to real leaks) and should not be Loctited (to
avoid a chemical reaction between steel and aluminum which can freeze a
bolt permanently in its tapped hole). Rather, just check them every time
you're in the neighborhood (e.g., when you change your oil). This is, no
doubt, Porsche's way of keeping you in intimate contact with your car.
