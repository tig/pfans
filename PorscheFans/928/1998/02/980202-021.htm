Perhaps this is a safety feature? After all, one would not want to
release the hatch while travelling at highway+ speeds (that would most
certainly change the aerodynamics, wouldn't it?). As for the hatch
release working if the door is then opened, well, I for one will most
likely not open my door at the aforementioned speeds (also an effect on
aerodynamics), unless of course I need to open the hatch to dump a body
out or something (I paid cash for my 928)(Also an effect on aerodynamics
since the weight is now reduced).

1. Get in car, close door
     Key in OFF or ACC position:  hatch releases
     Key in IGN position:  hatch does not release AND can no longer   be
released with doors closed, regardless of key position, until door is
opened
and then closed to reset hatch release lockout function.

2. Either door open, any key position: hatch releases.

The moral here is that the owner's manual may be telling the truth (like
Clinton), but there's more to the story than meets the eye.  BTW, I
performed
the above steps several times to assure repeatability of operation, and
I feel
resonably safe in saying that this is how the hatch is supposed to work.

So...the next time you pick up your significant other at the grocery
store in
the rain (or want the bellhop to grab your bags) and want to pop the
hatch
with the car running, just open the door and then pull the release...it
should
work.
