I installed an AFR meter on another car and have observed this weird
ping-ponging rich to lean - closed loop operation and as Marc sez is
normal.  Only time when the O2 readings stabilize is pretty much under
WOT.

What I found interesting was that cold or hot engine, it never
approaches 14.7:1 or even 14.0:1 !  Runs closer to rich side of things
at 13.7:1 (idling) or even 12.5:1 (WOT).  The meter instructions
indicate this is normal as well.  We should all note that these sub-$200
meters are in no way as accurate as 'real' AFR equipment ie. Horiba,
etc. but exist to give a ballpark measure.  

I'd much rather be running slightly 'rich' than lean that's for sure! 
The car passes all emissions tests so runs clean.  Maybe it's programmed
to add just a hair more fuel to make up for all the crazy additives &
sulfur content of U.S. gas?  At least I know it has a good pump &
regulator!

Er, where were we...

Whew, I thought you were gonna' say they turn all wheels and clocks 10's
in the 1/4 mile!

That's one wild 928 garage setup!  I'm just adding pegboard now to keep
my tools better organized!
