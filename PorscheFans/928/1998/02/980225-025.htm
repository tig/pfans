Fellow Shark Chums:

[[sexist flame suit ON]]

One of my fellow staffers here informed me that "Men have it so tough
because they have those huge egos to deal with."  When I laughed at her and
asked why she thought women were different,  she continued "Women have
vanity, which is much different!"

Carrying this to an illogical conclusion:

Most women here (my office) are concerned about wearing the same dress more
than once in a week or maybe even a month.  While the car is important to
them as part of an image,  it is more on the anti-negative side than the
positive.  More effort is spent making sure you don't drive the wrong car
than might be spent looking for the right car.  With
dependability/reliability and O&M costs high on these cars,  women may make
a better choice.  Maybe no 'fashion statement' is better than one that
repeats itself every day.

[[Sexist flame suit OFF]]

I think of the car as a toy, or maybe like a piece of jewelry like a fine
watch.  Not being a big-time jewelry wearer,  the watch is about my only
expression of individuality as far as dress;  otherwise it's gray suit and a
tie every day.  Maybe the tie qualifies as an individual expression too.
Thoroughly enjoy driving the car, though. And while it is an adequate
expression,  there may be better choices for some.  I've met a lot of judges
as a result of driving Lotus, Ferrari, and other "exotics" thanks solely to
their appearance.  I decided that conservative performance sedans were safer
in that regard.  Now that I'm a "distinguished gray-haired executive
reaching for a bit of lost youth",  I don't even get a second glance.  I'm
also invisible to under-thirty females, so it's not an ego-fulfilling issue.
I still thoroughly enjoy driving it.
