We noticed while replacing some intake manifold and cam cover gaskets
that the butterfly flap in the intake plenum, which is supposed to open
at about 4000rpm for increased torque, was stuck closed.  The vacuum
operated actuator didn't have enough oomph to open it until we manually
opened and closed the flap a few times and cleaned where the flap seats
when closed.  Without major disassembly, about all that can now be seen
is the very top of the flap's pivot shaft, and I don't know whether the
vacuum line to the actuator is accessable or not for testing.  In any
case, careful observation of the top of that shaft as rpm's increase
would tell the story.  I wonder how long that flap had been stuck.
(This applies only to '87 and later I think.)
