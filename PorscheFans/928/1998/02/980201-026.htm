Hi everybody!
I joined the list... for what I think is a VERY good reason: 
I just bought (Jan 30th) a '82 928S.
I am from Milan, Italy -  Yes, the country of Ferrari, Lamborghini, Alfa
Romeo, Maserati, Lancia... And I bought a Porsche... Well, there must be
some GOOD reason!


I hope I won't have to work just to pay the maintenance and gas!!
(BTW How much do you pay for gasoline in the US/Canada?? Here we pay 1.16
USD for 1 litre - I hope I won't get too bad mileage!)

My car's body is in VERY poor conditions, it was exposed to hail (I hope
this is the correct term for "rain of ice cubes") and it is completely
covered with bumps all over. Poor baby. I'll work on it... And drive her
back to the forgotten beauty!
Some water got in thru the windshield and ruined the console.
BUT, the engine sounds fantastic and there is no sign of oil leakage at
all. The odo marks 116.000 Km.
I bought it for 3,360 USD. I hope the body work won't cost me more than that!
Fortunately we don't have that much problems in getting spare parts: EVERY
part for EVERY model of 928 is available here. It takes 1-2 days to have
it. If it has to be imported form Germany it takes 3-4 days. The problem,
as usual, is PRICES! So I'm looking around to see if I can find a
demolished 928  with the interior in good shape to use as spare parts.

Here are some questions for you, I'd appreciate if you could help:
1) I read messages coming from USA and Canada. Is there someone else from
Europe on this list? It would be nice to meet!
2) Does anyone have the electric wiring of 928S? Is it possible to scan
some parts and let me have them?
3) I do not have the user's manual... There is a button with the "!"
exclamation point on it in the central console beside the fasten belts
sign, What is it for? Is it some kind of test?
4) Is the electric seat commands board supposed to be FIRMLY attached to
the iron structure of the seat, or is it supposed to stay attached just to
the leather cover?
5) My 928 does not have the sun-roof. Did anyone install one on a 928 that
didn't have it? It seems the roof is very narrow, so I think it is very
difficult to have the roof slide open... Any suggestion?
6) Embarassing question: Where is the fuse box located? I almost took apart
half of the car... And still can't find it!
7) The ventilation/AC fan does not seem to work. I'll check the fuses and
the wire connectors. (when I'll find them!). Does anyone has some
diagnostic procedure to follow to solve this issue?

Well... I'd have many other questions... But I do not want to bother you...
At least not SO MUCH, not SO SOON!

Thank you very much for your attention and for helping me.
