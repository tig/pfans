A couple of questions for you all.

My 85S doesn't have the 928S decal on the back and I'm thinking about 
replacing it. Question is, what colour should it be. Grey and silver seem 
to be the colours to choose from. My car is gold (weissgold or something 
like that) so I wonder what was on it originally? Decals are also 
available for the large P O R S C H E lettering on the back as well. Mine 
has the lettering molded into it, are they all that way or did some just 
have decals? Perhaps the decal is supposed to sit in the moulded letter 
but I think that would be a bit too loud for my tastes.

I found red fluid under the front of car. I thought the worst (steering 
rack) but was pleased to see that it was a leak from a hose. It seems to 
have swelled a little where it connects to the reservoir. Is there 
anything special about the rubber used in the hose, i.e. do I have to buy 
something specifically made for the job, or is a more generic hose OK?
