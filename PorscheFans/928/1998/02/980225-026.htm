Fellow shark chums:

I've had exceptional luck using synthetic oil in many older engines.  As far
as loosening old sludge and crud into the oil system,  what leads anyone to
believe that synthetic is any worse than a good detergent dino oil in the
same service?

Porsche has not recommended non-detergent oil for it's cars since the 50's
when detergent oils were first introduced.  The only "modern" engines I've
seen with a non-detergent recommendation have been Harley-Davidson (straight
50 weight ND!); Even they gave this up after they figured out they wouldn'd
really have a crankcase full of suds.

Early synthetics somehow developed a reputation for leaking and damaging
seals and gaskets.  The myth lives on long after that was addressed in the
formulations less than two years after they were introduced way back when.
It's not too likely that you are still using that old stuff.

So, if you are concerened that you'll free up a bunch of sludge when you
change the oil,  change it twice.  Pull a cam cover to see what has really
built up in there.


For those who remember this far back,  my '65 SC used to develop a thick
gray paste in the oil sump even though the oil was changed more than
regularly.  It was apparent from the plug and screen that it was continuing
to build up in there even with the frequent services.  It went away in a
couple changes when I changed from Penzoil (then the 'Dealer's Choice') to
Valvoline.  That was 25 years ago, though, and the oils have improved a lot
since then.  I still refuse to use Penzoil even in my lawnmower.  Old
grudges die hard, eh?  Everything gets at least Mobil-1 now, except the
scooters and the race car that live on Bel-Ray (thanks to a sponsorship deal...)
