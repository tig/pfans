Hi all,
I am just about to do a 90K mile service on my car but I would
like to fix this problem first. For reference, it is an '87 5 spd.
Recently (for the last week or so) my car has been hunting at
idle (ramping up and down from perhaps 400 to 900 rpm). It is a 
very regular hunting (goes up and down approximately once per
second). Also, when coming to a stop it often stalls. 
Beyond the idle and stalling, it seems to run just fine (can't be
TOTALLY sure I'm not down on a bit of power since I don't really let
loose with my snow tires in place, but it seems to rev fine.)
Disconnecting Temp sensor II changes things slightly, but does not
stop the hunting.
Anyone have any insight as to what the problem might be? The onset 
seemed to coincide with filling the gas tank, but a new tank of a
different brand and some Techron don't seem to be solving anything.

Thanks much in advance

David Schultz
