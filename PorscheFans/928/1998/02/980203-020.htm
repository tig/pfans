Stephane,

Sorry, it does sound like they are overly
pressurized.

Is there any chance that the water pump is pumping
against a closed thermostat while the car is warming
up, and that when the t'stat opens up, there is less
pressure on the hoses?

I guess we'll all have to get out there and feel our
hoses (radiator that is) when the motor is just getting
warm.
