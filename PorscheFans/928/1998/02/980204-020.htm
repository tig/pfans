If what you're describing on the front disks is what I think it is,
they're fine. The front disks are slotted, to encourage gas, and
maybe other bad things, to escape from under the pad under hard
usage. 

The problem you're having sounds like one Stephane had, which was
eventually cured by replacing the master cylinder. You might also
check to be sure that there is adequate free play at the pedal;
there's a spec for how much the rod into the master cylinder is
supposed to move before resistance is felt.
