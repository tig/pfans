  Plug wires won't be too difficult to change on the '83.  Remove the air
  intake tubes and the upper portion of the air cleaner housing to gain
  access.  Just make sure you change only one wire at a time.  You will need 
  a gauge to set the plug gap.  I would replace the dist cap and rotor as
  well.  The nodes on the cap will be numbered, so remove one wire from the
  old cap and place it correctly on the new cap to avoid crossing wires.
  
  As for fluids, I changed the trans/diff fluid over to Amsoil this 
  weekend.  For me, every new job brings the opportunity to buy new 
  tools, and this one was no exception.  I bought a 17mm drain plug socket 
  for $5 and a 1 pt. suction gun for $10.  I used the suction gun to pump 
  the oil into the fill hole. Both were made by Plews and both made the job 
  very easy.
  
  If you change the antifreeze, remember that there are drain ports on the
  block as well as in the radiator.
  
  Have fun.  Doing this type of work on the 928 is not very difficult.
