Dear Mr. Hoffman,

Yes, I did overeact to Mr. Post's comment. My observation was based upon my
perception of his words. Mr. Post did write me back to explain that his
cat(whom he does care for), was happily situated upstairs well beyond harms
reach. Interesting note: rather than vacation a number of years ago, I opted
to go to gunsmithing school in Colorado for a year. During the refinishing
segment, it was demonstrated to us how cat urine is probably the most
effective way of removing the purple/black oxide finish popularly known as
"bluing". I never did inquire as to how the urine was collected though...
