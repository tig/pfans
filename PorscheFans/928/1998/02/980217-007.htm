>Just how much oil is a 73K miles 91 S4 expected to get through?

There was a thread about a month ago (I think I started it) on this
very subject.  My _estimate_ of the consensus was that 1 quart per
1000 miles is the maximum oil consumption of a healthy Shark.
Consumption that high seems to be most prevalent with those of us who
do not drive our Beasts regularly coupled with harder driving.  It
also seems that the newer sharks drink more oil, but that may be
correlation without causality - simply due to the newer Sharks not
being driven as much as the older ones.

IMHO, if your Shark is using 1 quart per 1000 miles or higher you
should check for oil leaks otherwise it's probably normal.

Last weekend I had to add another half quart and spent some time
looking for an oil leak - and I found one (see below).

Perhaps, perhaps not.  If the leak is a trickle then you may be able
to just keep the level topped off.  I have a very slight leak in the
transaxel.  My mechanic recommended monitoring the situation as repair
would cost about $1500 (have to pull th tranny). He said that as long
as the leak was slight and the level of fluid in the transaxel was
monitored there would be no problem.

I'm actually interested in other answers to your question - primarily
as a guage of my mechanic's competence.

The engine oil leak spoor I found was that the driver's side valve
cover has oil on top of it.  I'm going to browse the shop manuals and
see if I can do a little investigative work.  I'd be interested in any
similar experiences and words of wisdom.
