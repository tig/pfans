Greetings all:

Further to the pan bolt/Loctite thread (bad pun, sorry), since Loctite's
HQ is two towns over, I did the same thing Jim did, except by phone. 

Jim, you'll be pleased to hear that your email was well-known to the
tech guy I talked to.  He found the response, but gave me a different
name as the sender, one Chris Musante.  He's one of our region's (CVR)
911 hot shoes...on his way, as we speak, to race at Sebring.

Couldn't reach him (will do so when he returns), but can offer the
following from the folks that build his engines:  use the European "red"
Loctite, available from Automotion.  

Per the local shop's 928 guru, use it on the pan gasket and on the
bolts, BUT just resolve that you'll have to check the torque
periodically.  

He also notes that the dissimilar metals problem exists on every item
connected to the block.  He doesn't feel that use of any Loctite product
helps or aggravates the phenomenon.    

Once again, a less than conclusive result.

Regards,
