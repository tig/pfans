OK, I have to confess.  "My" car is really my wife's car.  I drive the 
914 to work everyday.  When we go out together in the 928 she usually 
"lets" me drive ;-).  I get to do all the work on it (which I love) and 
keep it looking good (am I a good husband or what?).  She loves getting 
looks from guys in Camaros, Firebirds, Mustangs, etc., and then burning 
their asses!  Sometimes, if I follow her to work in the morning, I'll 
look over and see her in the black shark with her sunglasses on, long 
blonde hair flowing down over her shoulders, and hear the sound of that 
throbbing V-8, and I'll tell you what, I almost lose it right there!  
And we've been married for 20 years!


Women and sharks were made for each other!
