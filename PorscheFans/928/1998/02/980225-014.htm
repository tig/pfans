>    I think what you are calling the fuel injection head is called the
fuel
> distributor. There is a rubber O-ring on the bottom that may be bad
causing
> the leak. Maybe the PO did not install it properly. Three screws hold the
> fuel distributor in place and you should have to use an impact driver to
> get them out. Also you will have to disconect all the fuel lines to be
able
> to remove the fuel distributor. The O-ring from dealer should only cost a
> few dollars. The fuel distributor is usually the last part to go, but if
> the PO tampered with it, he could have forgot to replace the O-ring or
> installed it wrong.
>    928 International can get you a fuel distributor for much less and
they
> are on the web.
>    For those prices you could fly my wife and me to Italy and I'll
replace
> your fuel distributor with one of my extras :) !
>     Good luck! Let me know how it goes.
