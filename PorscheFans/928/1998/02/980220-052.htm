I can't help responding to the question of the value of service records
when contemplating the puchase of a 928, or any other car, for that
matter. Way back when, I was looking at an absolutely cherry car and was
so enthusiastic, I considered not bothering with the mechanic's check.
And, of course, no service records. Well, it turned out that all sorts
of things were wrong with the thing, the seller had done a masterful job
of disguising its ills. I don't recall many specifics, except that the
mechanic had to show me a very obscure place where the original color
showed (which is not in itself evidence of trouble, but things like a
bent frame were-seller had done a great job with alignment, etc. to
disguise) Moral, I suppose, is the more sophisticated you are
mechanically, the less vulnerable you may be, but within limits.

Before buying my Shark last year, I noticed from its records that it had
been in a rear-ender early in its life. So at the mechanical check, I
asked the mechanic to specifically look for any possible legacy from
that. Also, such common and vital work as tension belt (and water pump)
replacement is something you either have to know when last replaced, or
have to do immediately after buying because...don't make me tell all the
bad things a blown belt might rain down on you. (And that's a $1,200
swing in fair purchase price right there.)

Bottom line, for a relatively high end car like a 928, I'd have to
wonder why an owner wouldn't have all records. Its just expected. What
else didn't he do? Or, worse, what's he trying to hide? You'd be betting
a fair chunk of change that you could find the answers to these
questions. I know that I wouldn't. There are other Sharks in the sea.
Wait for one whose pedigree you can establish and I predict you'll sleep
better at night.
