There's a table at the bottom of the page, and the 928 is one of the
cars tested.  Be warned, that the page author is a Pantera fan.

I still have a photocopy of the whole of that article from the 1981 Pop.
Mechanics.  It was my ONE reference to ALL the cars that were the
greatest during my late teens.  I should OCR parts of it, but what the
Pantera fan doesn't tell you is that, right at the end of the article the
testers all got together and agreed that if the were going to take any
of the cars and drive it any distance for a weekend vacation, the 928
was the one they would choose.  The feeling was "here are the numbers,
but the 928 was our favourite."

It was the ONLY time I can remember wanting a 928, actually!

It was a fabulous article, too.  A totally fantasy, all those cars in one
place getting hammered to death and evaluated.  I probably read it
30 or 40 times over the years.  It's in a box in the bottom garage,
I will find it in the weekend....
