Just a small story/explanation for the Yanks on the list:

Several years ago, while in Auckland, NZ, my trip coincided with the
annual 'football' contest between Sydney and Auckland.   It was played
locally - Aussie rules, as we would say here in the States.

The entire country seemed intent on this 'contest' (game to us).
Immediately after the contest, people poured into the bar of the hotel I
was staying and stood transfixed (with the rhymic punctuation of beer
glasses rising and falling) watching the game re-televised over the
Tellies (TV's) througout the bar.   After it was over, the game was
immediately played over again!   Looking through the crowd, all heads
watched the screens, eyes fixated and mouths agape.   It was impressive
to see such intensity.

So, thanks Mr. Zeck for the memory.
