Chris,
I have worked on five or six cars (and trucks) with these devices installed,
and nearly all of them had to be removed because they caused more problems
than they prevented.  It seems like a good idea, but either the circuitry
fails,
or the internal contacts build up too much resistance to allow maximum
current
flow to the starter.  In order to keep the price affordable for the majority
of
consumers, the manufacturer had to "cut a few corners".  Due to the high
current
draw, it is difficult to (cheaply) put something in series with the battery
(and the
starter) that will have long-term reliability.

Your best bet, if the car is not going to be driven for an extended time, is
to dis-
connect the battery, or get an "automatic, electronic" trickle charger to
keep the
battery charged.  Be sure it is one that will sense the battery's state, and
auto-
matically turn off when it is fully charged.  This type of charger usually
starts at
around $100.  Leaving a normal charger on a battery continuously will RUIN
the
battery.
