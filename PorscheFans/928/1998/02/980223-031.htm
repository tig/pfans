Dear Brother's (& little sister's) of the fraternal, Holy order of
Porsche:

Guten tag, Wie Geht's mit dir, greeting's!

I just purchased a 1982 Porsche 928 and this beauty rocks, it is almost
better than sex, but don't tell my girlfriend.....please!!

The problem that I am having is that sometimes when I turn off the
headlights, the individual headlamps won't retract...so I pulled the
whole switch out of the dash and it is sitting loose in the hole.

The way I get it to close is to fiddle with the whole switch mechanism
until the lamps retract...while it is closing, I can hear a "clicking"
in the electric box located next to the fuse box at the floor of the
passenger footwell.

If I replace the switch, what are the chances that I have a problem with
a connection down behind the dash???  I hope that is not the problem!!
Has anyone ever had that problem with the light switch??

The car only has 99,000 miles so I am hoping I only need to replace the
lightswitch it self???

Thanks

Mark
