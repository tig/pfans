FWIW: I've been reading the motorhead magazines' reviews of the 928 for
years, and one of the constant points of criticism has been the
suspension settings. Gradually, model by model, the 928's settings (and
setups) have been upgraded, stiffer and stiffer (this would only be
natural, as the engines were also growing in HP and torque.). The
original 928, which was reputedly designed with the U.S. market in mind,
was considered much too soft, at least by Posche standards. By the GT,
(or was it the GTS?) reviewers were beginning to question if Porsche had
gone too far, especially with the sport package. The obvious conundrum
is the conflict between the prodigious power and the weight penalty of
all the creature comforts we enjoy. Something had to give.
 
The S4 seems the consensus winner for best balance between performance
and comfort, but I remember the author of a review in Excellence, while
profuse in his praise, blasting the ease at which the S4 bottomed out on
uneven pavement. (That issue sits on my headbord at home, if anyone
wants me to quote mo/yr). My own experience is that its a touch more
compliant than I'd like, but I've always preferred the Germanic
sensibilities in this area.
