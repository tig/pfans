Hello Everyone:

I have a bit of information for any Porsche owners living in the state
of Florida.  I was cruising behind a dump truck and got my windshield
creamed by a flying rock...totally cracked it all the way across.

I later learned that Florida insurance companies are required by law to
replace windshields that have cracks which hinder driving ability i.e. a
crack located in the line of vision.

So I took my Porsche to a local glass company that my insurance company
uses for their claims and the total bill on the windshield was $900.00. 
All I did was sign on the bottom line and walked out without paying a
dime, the insurance company picked up the tab.  This law may also apply
in your state, so call your insurance company or local commissioner and
get the facts on this one.

Or better yet move to Florida for a month, get it replaced and then move
back

Mark
