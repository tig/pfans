Add 'Heated O2 sensor' to the varietal O2 sensor flavors, used when the
sensor is mounted too far away from the exhaust manifold to heat
properly (about 600 degrees allows the beginning of accurate readings or
so I've read).

Interesting...  Is there a standard for O2 sensor output?  I'll check
these voltages in my other car manuals to see the difference on a small
scale.

This is getting good.  I'm going to fall back on an old post which
stated the only thing a bad O2 sensor will cause is failed emmissions
testing.  I've no idea about running condition and/or incorrect
signaling type to the CPU... but I know that I refuse to pay $200 for a
sensor simply for the name.  And you've already found the same part no.
for a different application for half the cost, so why should we get
gouged like that!  Just for a connector?  Puh-lease not!!!

Penny-wise and dollar-foolish or something like that...
Phil
