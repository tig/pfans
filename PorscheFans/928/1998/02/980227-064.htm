  My '83 doesn't have a sticker either.  Call 1-800-PORSCHE and ask them
  to give you the 800# for the department that can tell you which options
  are on "your" car.  You'll need the VIN.

  Speakers are under those holes.  I'm not aware of an audio upgrade option,
  although the radio itself was an option.  $45K and you still didn't get a
  radio as standard equipment!

  Probably the fuel pump.  Some are known to be noisy.  You should change
  the fuel filter for good measure.

  Yes.  A negligible number of people would know how to properly install
  such a device in this car.  I would strongly advise against doing so.

  I don't blame you!  The best hand-me-down car that I could get at your 
  age was my parent's '71 Toyota Corona stationwagon...
  
  Take good care of it for your mother and maybe she'll give it to you
  one day!
  
  Congrats!
