A customer of mine wants to sell his 1986 Black 928.  One owner, about 56K,
Automatic, Cream leather, original paint (very nice..no dents or dings), new
tires, etc.  This car was driven to the office in the mornings and the golf
course in the afternoons.  No time trial, autox, etc.  I have serviced this
car since new and have all of the records on it. Best guess as to value???
The car is in Fort Worth, Texas

Don:
I spent nearly six months researching, reading, investigating & searching
before I bought my LATE (serial # 1,000 or higher) 1986 928 S 5-speed with 92k
and (for all intents & purposes) one owner, all records, new Dunlop D40 tires,
uncracked dash and very good (not perfect) bodywork & interior, rear AC and
limited slip diff.  I paid $13,500.  I needed new rotors & pads, most of the
front speakers were (still are) on their last legs, had two minor windshield
dings and cosmetic dings on two wheel rims, the light behind the water temp
gauge was out, the driver's side seat's rear height adjuster was out, some
interior lights were (still are) intermittent, and the passenter side hatch
release did not work.  My inspection did NOT show an AC compressor on its last
legs, so that cost me an unexpected $850.  I replaced my timing belt immediate
after my 2,000 mile drive home (but, stupidly, did not change my water pump
while in there, which has given no problems) despite records indicating a
change at 60k as specified by Porsche.  I have also needed to replace my idle
stabilizer valve.  All in all, I spent a little more than the $2k than any
buyer of a used 928 more than, say, eight years old, should expect to spend in
their first year after purchase.

If the car you mention is in *very good* but not concours condition, with no
dash cracks, torn leather or dinged wheel rims, then I think a real world
price would be $15k to $16k.  This assumes that EVERYTHING works: power
windows, seats, mirrors, hatch release, stereo, hvac, cruise, interior lights,
sunroof... EVERYTHING!  A good shopper can legitimately demand and get $2k to
$5k off this price depending on how much isn't working.  This also assumes
that the buyer's inspection won't come back saying something like "needs new
rotors, shocks, power steering rack, etc., all of which pull the real world
value down in a big hurry.

You do not mention if this is a LATE 1986 928.  Cars built from serial number
1,000 and up have the much better "S4" brakes, which are larger and include
the superb Brembo 4-piston front calipers, as well as the anti-lock that was
standard on all 1986's (and 85's, if I remember correctly).  Add between $500
and $750 to the price if this car has the larger brakes.

The way the market seems to be going the much rarer 5-speeds are gaining in
value over automatics due to the used markets greater emphasis on performance
over convenience.  The market does not seem to value either the rear AC or the
limited slip differential (the later very rare & highly desirable for peak
performance), tho' the rear AC might command a few extra $ in Texas' heat,
especially given the popular but toasty black!  Prices for the 32v 85-86
models will always be somewhat dependant on how many of the cosmetically more
popular 87 & later models are available at the time you go to market.
Unfortunately, many ill-informed buyers will choose a poor 87+ over a superior
condition 85/86.

Of course, in our world, it's worth whatever you can get someone to pay for
it.  I hope this helps.
