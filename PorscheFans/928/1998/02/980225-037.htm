Hi Howard:

WHEW!  Glad the car made it through the storms.  Still not over yet so
storage somewhere safe in order?

Actually dual airbags became the standard across the board for Porsche
in MY 1990.  The were the first auto maker to adopt this standard.  I
don't think it will be feasible to try to retrofit the system but who
knows.  Just trying to find all the components will be a challenge -
wheel with non-exploded bag, ditto pax dash (and new dashboard for that
matter), all kinds of sensors, the brain box, wiring harnesses etc. 
Don't know what would happen if you only did the drivers wheel.  If you
got that far then the whole sheebang shouldn't be a problem.  

I've never heard of this done before though (most requests have been to
disable/remove airbags) ...  Since most mechanical shops won't touch the
airbag system even if it came stock, that leaves you to entrust this job
to a bodyshop.  I don't think Porsche itself would touch the retrofit
due to liability issues.

I questioned myself as well when I removed the airbag module off a
different car.  To be honest with you all, I wore my helmet, gloves and
a cup (stop laughing, dammit!)  and stayed low to the car floor when
pulling the connectors off under the dash (of course the battery was
already disco'd).   If the bag explodes it leaves behind all kinds of
crap from the charge and I read it causes chemical burns to boot.  

The feeling of impending doom didn't go away even after it was
disconnected and I handled the loose assembly like Eddy Murphy did with
the package of 'sound sensing bullets' in Beverly Hills Cop.   (I'm
laughing now thinking of net surfers pulling a search "Eddy Murphy" and
finding this lovely thread)

Interesting project idea though.
