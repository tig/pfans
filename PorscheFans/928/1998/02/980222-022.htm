     First let me say that I don't have any monetary interest in the Lojack
company.  Lojack is not even available here in sacramento.  Back in 1989/90 I
was employed as a law enforcement officer in Santa Monica CA.  Lojack came to
town and I was fortunate enough to be one of the trainers for the police
department.   
     The Lojack auto recovery system consists of a device which is hidden in
your vehice by a Lojack installer, after you purchase the system(around $500in
1990).  The device is dormant until you report your car as STOLEN (yikes) to
the local police department.  Once the police dept. inputs the your stolen
veh's information into the stolen vehicle system(a nation wide computer
system) the  Lojack device  in your car starts sending out a signal which is
picked up by police cars equipted with a tracking device.  The information
provided is the same information an officer would get if he/she ran the plate
on a stolen car.  Make, model, color, method of theft, etc.
      I recovered a brand new, M.B.Z. 500 SL, because of the Lojack system.
The creep that stole the car was not aware that the rental car agency that
he'd stolen the car from had installed the lojack system in all their high end
cars.                  
      The crook was very slick in his method of theft, and recovery of the
vehicle would have doubtful at best.  If you have the availability of Lojack
in your area I would highly recommend having it installed.  It won't keep your
shark from being stolen, but it may help you get it back before it makes it to
a shipping container, or chop shop.
