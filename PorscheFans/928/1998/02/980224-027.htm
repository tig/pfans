I'm sure you'll get several responses to this one - best bet is to replace
the relay - that's what makes the clicking noise you are hearing.  If the
switch was the problem there would be no power to the relay.  Can't really
determine if the root cause is indeed the switch by your description.  A
simple test with a multimeter jumped across the switch contacts would narrow
down the problem.

In the meantime you can raise or lower the headlights manually by removing
the rubber boot from the control motor and turn the knob located at the top
of the motor housing.

Subject: There's a ghost in my headlights


The problem that I am having is that sometimes when I turn off the
headlights, the individual headlamps won't retract...so I pulled the
whole switch out of the dash and it is sitting loose in the hole.

The way I get it to close is to fiddle with the whole switch mechanism
until the lamps retract...while it is closing, I can hear a "clicking"
in the electric box located next to the fuse box at the floor of the
passenger footwell.

If I replace the switch, what are the chances that I have a problem with
a connection down behind the dash???  I hope that is not the problem!!
Has anyone ever had that problem with the light switch??
