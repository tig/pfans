You mean the Maserati Barbecue?  Interesting sideline:  some little
design
flaw in that car, something like the PCV valve aims itself into the
alternator,
so if you're running really hard, and there's lots of crankcase
pressure, you
blow a bit of oil vapor into the alternator, which burns quite nicely.

A friend of mine is a mech for Ron Tonkin's exotics, and he's seen quite
a 
few of these come in post-flame-throwing.  He told me he had a Bi-T pass
him on the way to Bend, OR going hell-bent, and joked to his wife,
"we'll
see him on fire in a bit"....and it happened to the guy just a few miles
ahead.
