Actually, you tried to make a hell of a lot more points
than just that. I dismissed all of them.

James, you should relax. My mission is to give the 928
undue respect. There are far too many other cars out there
in the asphalt jungle that can out perform the stock, early 928
in acceleration. That's the only weakness of an early 928. Tilo
did a great job of "smoking" the competition at TWS in
his 928. His _was_ all Porsche, but not stock. I'm sure
that he spend quite a bit more than me to get the performance
he now commands. He was 8 seconds faster than the NSXs. 8
seconds! That's like, a time lapse of forever! My 84 has
lost the holeshot/drag twice...once to a Mustink and once
to an IROC. It means nothing to those drivers that I can
annihilate them in the twisties or on the top end. Now, I
have a PorsChevy that'll smoke every aspect of those loosers.

My mission is to kill the wannabe's. It'll always look like
a 79 928 did 'em in. From that point on, everytime they see
another 928 of any vintage, they'll divert course to avoid 
further public humiliation.

I'm on your side. Too bad you don't accept that.
