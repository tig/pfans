	I have a problem with the fuse for my license plate lights and
hood light
	system.
	The fuse keeps blowing but when I replace it, it is fine and
wont blow.
	usually lasts a few days to a few weeks before it blows. Im
baffled!

	Im driving my car to chicago from tulsa OK this weekend.  Its
about a 9 hr
	drive. I wonder what kind of milage I will make.  Last time I
took the trip I
	made about 24 mpg with the AC on!

	I had a similar problem with my '83 S and found that one of the
license plate light's hot wire was shorting to ground.  The wire was
mis-routed and got caught between the rear bumper cover and the aluminum
bumper member.  The vibration eventually chafe the insulation, thereby
exposing the wire.  Since I was restoring the S, removing the bumper
cover to access it was not a problem.  Maybe this is your problem.
