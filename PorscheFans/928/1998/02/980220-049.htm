What you're saving by doing that is wear on the clutch throwout
bearing (and associated bits). It's the thing that makes the
connection between the non-rotating clutch release lever and
the rotating clutch mechanism. The clutch itself doesn't wear
significantly when it is fully engaged or fully disengaged,
only when it's partially engaged (i.e., slipping). So stay
off the clutch pedal at the stop lights, and you'll be doing
the right thing. Some people even recommend staying off the
clutch pedal when starting the car, since the pressure from
the throwout bearing is absorbed by crankshaft bearings (and
seals?) which are in their least-lubricated state when
starting.
