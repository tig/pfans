Is anyone else annoyed by the indicator light of the "Central Locking
System" that is located next to the "Central Warning System" light on the
center console?  The Porsche engineers have baffled me again.  As you well
know, the light for the locking system goes from dim to bright when the
locking system is activated (i.e. the doors are locked).  Unfortunately, I
always catch the light in my peripheral vision while driving, and a brief
bout of anxiety sets in when I think that the Warning System light has come
on.  I would have thought that the locking system light should be bright
when the doors are not locked to warn you that you need to lock them, and
then go dim once the doors have been locked.  Has anyone ever tried to
reverse the sequence of the light in question so that it will dim when the
doors are locked?
