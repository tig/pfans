My Saab runs on dino oil, but this is what I understand from my mechanic
and experiences on The SAAB Network mailing list. Synthetic oil DOESN'T
damage seals. However, over time gaskets shrink, crack, flex, and do
other stuff. This leaves small gaps. Conventional oil gets into these
gaps and dries up, thus closing small gaps. Synthetic oil breaks up the
conventional oil seals in the gaskets. If you use synthetic from the
start, the gaskets don't move, shrink or crack as much. That is the
reason for no leaks. Mechanics on the Saab list recommend not going to
synthetic at over 80,000 miles if you have any leaks. If you don't have
any leaks they don't recommend changing to synthetic over 120,000 miles.

dealer saying synth was bad)
