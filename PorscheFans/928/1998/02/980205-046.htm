It's possible (per the shop manual) to check the power steering pump,
if you have the right bits and pieces. Probably a dealer does, and
you don't. It was my impression that the typical rack failure was
to start leaking into the boots; why do you think rack rather than
pump? Incidentally, there's a filter built into the (plastic)
reservoir, which could conceivably be clogged. You should replace
the reservoir ($26 US) in any case.

Finally, I've been told several times that you should get all new
fluid into the system after any failure, because it's probably 
loaded with metal bits which will ruin the new piece you put in.
