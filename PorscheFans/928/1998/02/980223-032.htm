I need help. I'm considering plunking down some considerable cash for an '89
928S4 (automatic). The first thing I did was confirm VIN #'s throughout the
vehicle and confirm option codes. I gave it a thorough visual exam looking for
signs of paint work or body damage. So far the vehicle has passed muster. I'm
having a mechnic do a leak-down on Wednesday. My question is, what other areas
of concern should I focus on? The owner has few records. It drives well (sport
shocks), although an extremely firm ride for a lux. vehicle. Big ? is milage.
The current title shows milage is incorrect because of faulty odometer. Last
accurate milage was in '95 when the vehicle had 44,000. Any imput would be
welcomed.
