Agreed that the first posting was a bit rough but I think the intent
was right.  I own 2 cats that stays indoor all the time (they don't go
in the garage so no paw print problem).  If left alone to fend for
themselves, they would not survive.  This situation is entirely my
fault.  I always kept them inside because they are my pets and did not
want to find them run over or crapping on other peoples plant of walking
on their car (if they wanted to put up with cats, they would get their
own...).  Now that I made them totaly dependant, its up to me to care
for them.

To recap, you can be a moron for leaving your cat behind or you can be
a moron for letting your pet roam the neighbourhood and scratching
other peoples car paint...
