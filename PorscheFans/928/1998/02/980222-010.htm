Moira,

WOW! I suppose venting your anger was something you had to do.
However, I kind of liked the idea of refraining ourselves from
using vulgar, offensive (not to me, certainly) language in our
postings to the list. (May be the word "dicks" could have been
perfectly replaced with what you used in your subject line,
namely: "anatomical extensions", or "tripodic protuberances",
or something along those lines :-) ...)

At any rate, when it comes to spellings and/or semantics in many
of the postings, sometimes it's better to just ignore them, or
try to look on the possible positive side of the idea. For instance,
a quick look at the phonetics in the word "phallusy" would reveal
that perhaps the author meant to write "fallacy" whose phonetics
are almost identical; and, rigorous grammar aside, could perfectly
fit in the context of the idea.

Just for the record (from the Webster's Dictionary):

FALLACY: deception, false idea, erroneousness, an argument failing
         to satisfy the conditions of valid or correct inference.

as for PHALLUSY, you seem to have gotten it right...


Saludos,
