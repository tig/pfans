Leonard Musgray asked about the auto flaps and "ticking" coming from the
engine intake area...

Well, Leonard, if you happened to read any of my posts about my trials and
tribulations concerning intermittent overheating (finally solved), you'll
remember that I had disconnected my flaps so that they would stay open all the
time.

Takes a lot longer to get the car warmed up (winter here in the northeast),
and the temp indicator never gets above the 1st white mark (about 1/4).  But
on the other hand, it hasn't overheated since then.  Now I've just got to
replace the coolant temp sensor so that the flaps will work properly and then
I can reconnect the motor drive signal.  All in all, based on my experience I
wouldn't disconnect flaps unless you needed to (as in my case).  The engine
should really be running near the center of the gauge or a little higher for
proper operation.

Regarding the ticking...my 87does it also, primarily from the right side, and
is worse the longer the car sits unused.  Use it every day, and the ticking is
noticeably reduced.  The cause is the hydraulic lifter oil draining down the
longer it sits.  When you start a cold engine, it takes quite a while for the
lifter to pump up due to the high viscosity of the oil.  In this regard a
lower viscosity synthetic should fill the lifter sooner and quell the noise.
You can replace the suspect lifter(s) with new ones, but it isn't easy to
positively identify the problem ones.  Also (for what it's worth) I'm told
that even new replacment lifters can have the same problem.

There is a procedure mentioned in the shop manual to clean a spring-loaded
ball check valve in the cylinder head assembly which prevents oil from
draining from the cylinder/camshaft area when the engine is off.  The claim in
the manual is that if a clicking is heard after the engine is first started,
then the check valve is not completely closing when the engine is off, and
therefore should be cleaned.  Of course this doesn't prevent lifter bleed
down, just keeps oil in the camshaft/lifter area so that there is an oil film
on startup.  Haven't tried doing this, therefore don't know how much it would
help.
