Hi,
Will someone give me the size of wheels that are supposed to be from an '88
S4? Someone in Portland, OR, is selling a set and in talking to him on the
phone he indicated that they were of two different widths 7" x 16" and 9" x
16" with 225/50 on the 7" and 245/45 on the 9". I didn't think either of those
sizes were correct and I wanted to be sure before I looked at them. I thought
the S4 came with 8" x 16" all around.

BTW I have an '86 S.

Thanks,
If you respond by direct email, please send to louieott@aol.com. I only
receive the 928 list at the Ott928@aol.com address to cut down on the spam.
