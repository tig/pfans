I do expect both to be under the same pressure.  However, in my case, 
the hoses look like they would inflate if they where not rigid.  What
I am accustomed to see is a hose under slight pressure but that, when
squeezed, you can feel the fluid move around.  In my case, you cannot
squeeze the hoses until the engine cools off.
