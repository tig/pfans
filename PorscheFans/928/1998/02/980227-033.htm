  The upper and lower control arms of all 928s are aluminum and
  should never need to be replaced unless a) the ball joint in
  the upper control goes bad (a rare occurence), or b) you get
  into an accident which damages the control arms.

  They are not the same.  These are two distinct parts.  
  The ball joint carrier is a ~5" long base on which the 
  lower ball joint is actually mounted.  If you crawl under your car, 
  you will see two rounded-triangular "keys" mounted to the
  outer edge of the lower control arm near the spindle; these are
  used to align the front end.  The keys sit against the lower
  ball joint carrier, and the bolts that go through the center of 
  these keys pass through the carrier before they thread into the
  lower control arm.
  
                
                                            __
 control arm->  -------------------------  /  \ <-ball joint
                                        | /    \
                         bolts-> |   |  |--------       
                -----------------|---|---       |
                            |    |   |          | <-carrier
                            -----|---|-----------
                          key-> --- --- <-key
                                 
 
   NOTE:  the description and picture above only apply through
          mid-'86.  After that, the S4 front suspension was used
          and the ball joint and carrier were flipped to sit on
          TOP of the lower control arm.
