Well it was inevitable.. I got nailed doing 100 in a 70 in El Centro CA.

It was one of those times the cop decided to write the ticket before he =
even got out of the cruiser. I saw him going the other way and speed up =
when we passed eachother.. But I just kept on going at the same speed =
looking for him in the rear view mirror. As soon as I saw him being =
sneaky and trying to hide behind another car about half a mile back, I =
downshifted and slowed to 70.. It was too late, he told me that although =
he didnt have radar he used a pacing method from a mile back. He did, =
however, write me up for 95 in a 70, instead of 100.

I won't lie to get out of it, but I will do everything I can to get this =
ticket dismissed. That guy Mr. Tickets in San Diego will take care of =
this thing except he said he wont do it for an El Centro Citation -

I had a question for the list, for anyone in California.. I know that I =
can pay my fine and try to go to traffic school, but I seem to remember =
that there is a certain limit to how fast you were going that would make =
you ineligible for traffic school.. To get the ticket stricken from your =
record. Being a 21 year old 'kid' according to my insurance, paying my =
fine and paying for traffic school, even if I have to spend the night in =
El Centro, would be a lot cheaper than my insurance hike.

Anyone have any comments about this? Remember it was 95 in a 70 not 95 =
in a 60 or 65.. In case that matters.
