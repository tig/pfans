Finally got my Pano yesterday.  While browsing the article
on building Boxters in Finland, I was surprised to see a
picture of one of my company's laser measurement systems
right there at the top of page 8!  Surprised for 2 reasons.
First, I hadn't heard us about selling a system to check
Boxter bodies and second, these systems are not exactly
cheap - that's a significant investment for the volumes
of cars they're building (50/day now, 75/day in March, max
100/day if the 996 takes off).  This shows me how serious
Porsche is about building quality products.

Of course I personally have little interest in Boxsters.
For one thing, there's no place to put both my wife and
my 3-year old daughter, who loves it when I pop her car
seat in the back of the 928 to go for a drive.  And then
there are the prices.  The last one I saw at my local dealer
had a $55K sticker and didn't last long.  Just think of how
many nice 928s you could buy for that kind of money... the
85-86 5-sp my wife wants, a 90-91 GT for me, and enough left
over to build a garage to keep them all in - or maybe set
up a trust fund to pay for their insurance...
