The cam seals are not hard, but you gotta have patience and a little
trick is involved.   There is a rubber O-ring that sits in a groove of
the cam cover (the aluminum piece bolted to the front of the cam
housings in which the larger diameter cam seal resides) and slips over
the camshaft   In other words, there is the relatively large seal that's
easily installed - but there is also a very small rubber seal that is a
challenge.

Vince Yu responded to my post for help while I was trying to figure out
how to install that little O-ring.   It must be kept expanded against
the groove while driving the assembly over the camshaft.  Our solution
was to use a stepped socket from the tool box to keep the O-ring
expanded, and quickly driving the whole affair over the shaft so that
the O-ring stayed in the groove.   It winds up shaving a slight amount
of material off the O-ring, but at least in my case appears to have
worked okay.

This is hard to describe, but you will understand when you take things
apart.   The direct answer to your questions is that the seals are
definitely within the scope of home repair - but that little O-ring will
challenge you a bit.

Good luck!   And credit to Vince ......
