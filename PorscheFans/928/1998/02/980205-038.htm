<< Here in Sweden there is a new system of speed control under development.
 It will use GPS satelites for controlling how fast and where you are going.
 They have started in a little scale with cab trafic for school children in
one
 town and in two years they will have tested it ready. And then, if it works,
 all cars will have the equipment for controlling how fast you are driving.
 
 Is there a system like this in your country or is this a new swedish
invention? >>

Well the GPS has been used in avaition for a while. It isn't used to control
anything. But you can see how fast your going, direction and time of
destiniation.  They are in rental cars here in the US and in th Cadilliac and
Navigators I think. They use them for directions in the cars. I wouldn't like
to be controlled by anything.
