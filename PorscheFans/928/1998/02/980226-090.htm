While waiting for a 90 to become ready for purchase,
someone emailed me about an ad in the paper just today,
saw the car and bought it on the spot! So the 90 is no 
longer (needed too much and had no history anyway). 

Feel a little bad cause I told the seller I wanted the
car but was still working on out of state financing.
Sorry.

This car is really well maintained with all books. Needs
nothing. I'd like the paint to mirror a little more, but
I can work on that. High miles, but drove identically as
well as the 90 with half the miles, and I feel better cause
all the work is documented and the mechanic is in town.
