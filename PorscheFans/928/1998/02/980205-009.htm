Kim Crumb, the PCA 928 guru, did explain at the Frenzy that our
shark had som crank problem when it is subjected to racing condition.

This can be corrected by drilling the crank.  Your friend should not
be that worried about this problem as it is not the only Porsche
 afflicted byt this problem.  The 944 engine, most probably also the 924
one, greatly benefit from some extra drilling of the crank if they are
raced.
