The wire are fairly easy to change.  The trick is to change them one by
one to insure that you do not mix them up.  

A gapper for sparkplug is very useful.  At the minimum, it will let
you read the gap of the spark plug to ensure they are set right.  You
want to make sure that the spark plug threads engage fully before you
thighten them up (the heads are aluminum and can be stripped fairly
easily).  

Last thing, you want to put a little anti-seize on the tread of the 
spark plugs before you put them in.  It make removal at a later time
much easier.

Wild guess:

Someone described that a little gear in the VDO spedometer had a
tendency
to break.  It might be this, but I recall he had problem getting
a replacement.  This might jog the person's memory.
