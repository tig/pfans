Please allow me to share a story of what could have happened. . . but
didn't.  While returning from an out of state auction this weekend, I
encountered an illegal roadblock on a country road.  The roadblock was
on a blind curve and consisted of a roadsign, sawhorse and something
else.  Since I was not expecting it, the roadblock caught me completely
by surprise.  I nailed the brakes and launched the antique toys I was
carrying into me and the seatbacks.  (928S-4 stopping power is really
impressive.)  Unable to stop before the roadblock, I took the grassy
shoulder and went around it, at the cost of my car's belly pan.  Fearing
robbery or carjacking, I went about a mile past the roadblock and called
the police.  With God's help, I wasn't hurt and only the belly pan was
damaged.  Now, I'm wondering if I should claim the damage on my
insurance.  Do you think my rates would go up?  I've never had a ticket
or been at fault in an accident, and I'm a 31 year old male.  I have a
$500 deductible for collision, $0 for comprehensive.  If I was certain
my insurance rate would not go up, I would claim the damage and get the
pan replaced.  Also, can those pans be repaired?  I'd like your opinions
on this.

Also, I need 3 of the screws that attach the bellypan to the chassis at
the back, if anyone has some to spare.

Thanks a lot,

LeeH
