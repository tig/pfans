It's worth getting familiar with that buzz. After a nice long drive (so
everything's well warmed up), step outside the car while the engine's
idling and stand behind it. You should hear the buzz of the fuel pump. Get
familiar with the volume and character of that buzz, because any big change
(typically to louder or angrier-sounding) can indicate a blockage in fuel
flow (due, e.g., to clogged filter or non-functional tank venting).

I'm a little surprised to read that Rob is hearing the pump from inside the
car. The only times I've found it to be audible inside have been when it's
laboring, so your advice to change the filter sounds more than
general-principles good. It's also easy to check the tank venting. If you
hear a "whoosh" when you remove the gas cap after using up most of the
contents of the tank, it's not venting, and the pump is working hard
pulling a vacuum in the tank (can eventually implode the tank, and
definitely limits engine performance).
