Well you're off to a good start!

On what you decide to get only YOU will know!! :) 
I've Insured MY '85 928S with AAMI ...and at that point they were doing
GOOD
deals with the "quicktrack" alarm people..I can certainly recommend
them.

I think you should talk to a couple of Porsche mechanics regarding that
urban myth... I recommend you talk to Autohaus Hamilton on Sydney (02)
99051455
to get the "bottom line" on gearboxes of the "Rich and Porsche".

However my "baby" is a 4 speed Auto and I'm VERY happy with it's
performance. 
Yesterday I took part in the Porsche Club of New South Wales Motorkhana
Day. 
She performed flawlessly :^) ...and I didn't feel as though I was at a 
disadvantage for having the automatic gearbox. In fact I was
complemented on 
a couple of occasions for my driving ability with the beast!!
...errr.."baby"
(brag mode off!!!) :^)

Again..you will have EVERY opportunity to get the 928 YOU want..it's
JUST 
a matter of being patient. Yes you WILL find a black one..probably in
QLD

I finally bought my 928S from "Len Vine Automobiles". it was an OK 
experience. (02)9719 8099

I can also recommend Sydney European Car Centre 
...Chris Braer on (02) 9978 5222. 
Chris was on the lookout for SOMETIME for me for the verson I wanted. 
He knows the vehicles VERY WELL and is honest (realistic) about the 
industry in general. Tell him I recommended him to you
...a really NICE GUY!!! is Chris!

OK here's where it gets interesting... I had the SAME thoughts as you as
to the matter of getting an UNLEADED version. Here's the good news. 
After having a GOOD talk to Ian Hamilton I was able to redefine the
model 
and year of 928S to get. The 16 Valve 1985 model "leaded" 4.7 ltr
version 
ended up being the BEST model for me to get. WHY? well..it will HAPPILY 
run on EITHER FUEL!!!!! WITH NO PROBLEMS!!! so I currently run
the "baby" on premium unleaded...YES!!!!! Although designed for leaded, 
the engine has a "knock" sensor ..to eliminate pinging..and
retard/advance 
the timing to compensate for the different fuel types. The tolerances of 
the engine design allow the use of unleaded petrol with NO EFFECT on the 
wear of the engine! so..you DON'T NEED the "lead" to provide lubrication
...it's NOT an issue with the PORSCHE V8 !! cool eh?

OK next issue ..do you get the 16v or the 32v? Again after the chat I 
decided ...and it was agreed by Ian that the BEST version to get (for
me) 
was the LAST of the 16 valve 928S's.
His opinion was that ..(and I agree) the 16 valve engine is a "GO HARD"
V8. 
It was the biggest capacity V8 4.7 ltr 310hp model before they
introduced 
the 32 valve 5ltr.
Now you will learn in your dealings with people and 928's 
...the first model 32 valve (1986, built from October 1985) was NOT the
best. 
They had inlet manifold problems that were redesigned in the following
years. 

I was warned off the 1986-87 models for that reason.

It also became an issue of price..MY price range was between $30-35K so 
1988 models were WAY out of my price range. The 1985 model became my 
"holy grail" ..and to cut a LONG (sorry) story short..I found the baby
at 
Len Vine's for $39.9K and after a COMPREHENSIVE pre inspection test at
IH's 
I bought it for $34k. It needed a few "niggly" things repaired, aircondy 
re-gassed and a short in the air flow system, a broken door latch 
(door would open up over bumps) she was basically in excellent
condition. 
I bought her in December last year ..touch wood ..the "baby" is
performing
FLAWLESSLY!! ..I love it dearly!!!

Hope that helps!
