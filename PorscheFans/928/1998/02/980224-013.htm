	Actually the way to do it is to remove the 928's transaxle and just
	slip the whole Honda powertrain in there. Unfortunately you have
	to leave the Porsche engine in place to retain the proper weight
	balance. The only difficult part is that you have to drill a hole
	in the floor in back so you can insert the dipstick.

	If he has another Honda engine, putting one in the front will make it a 4WD/SUV.
That should take care of the equal weight distribution.  The torque tube is already in
place, so that shouldn't be a problem.  But then, the problem of synchronizing the
shifting between the two engines would be an issue.
