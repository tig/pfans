Yes, that seems to be the way it's supposed to work, BUT - I replaced 
both my resistor pack AND my blower motor with BRAND NEW ones (for other 
reasons - several fan speeds didn't work due to burned out resistors, 
and the blower motor bearings were shot/noisy), and my car still does 
it.  It went away for a short while, but came back.  So, there must be 
more stuff involved in this problem, presumably EVERYTHING in the 
circuit is suspect, speed switch, any relays, grounds, wires 
themselves?, etc., etc., etc....
