Stephane, How ya doin'?
I too experienced some of the adjusting symptoms you had. I think partly due
to the spring sag, you have to adjust up more than you think to put
compression on the spring again. I adjusted mine over a period of a few
days.....spec calls for 180mm + or - 10mm.....car started at 160mm and my goal
was to put it as close as possible to the middle of the spec (180mm)  So, I
went up 6 turns to 170mm, then 7 turns to 172mm, then 8 turns and it was still
172mm, then when I went to 10 turns, it went to 183mm. Go figure......(big
jump there) I also had made an adjustment up that lowered it once. Go figure
again!  Anyway after a few days and many subsequent re-checks in-between
adjustments, I finally ended up with it raised 9 turns to 175mm and left it
there. (it has stayed there too)
I'm like you, I didn't want to go much higher for fear of making it look
jacked-up, but hey, the spec is the spec! Hang in there, you'll get it.
Incidentally, I adjusted mine with the car on the ground and the wheels turned
full lock so that I could just reach in there and adjust. I used a locking
tape measure, and put the body of it on the concrete and pulled the tape up to
the measuring point and locked it. I also marked all 4 tire locations in the
garage so that measurements were consistent. (Also FYI, I measured the threads
on the adjusters and they are really more like 1.5mm per turn) Ride heights
are now correct, but still hoping to get it corner-balanced this spring.
Oh, BTW, has any one on the list installed the Weltmeiester springs, (which
would lower car about 25mm) and still put their car to factory ride height? Or
is there enough up-adjustment to make up for the additional 25mm?
