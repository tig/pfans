Hi Jeff:

Don't know if it helps but if you can have the seller verify presence or
not of Calif. emissions tag under the hood or in the doorjamb, the S4
might have already been prepared for 50-state operation.  I suspect it
was as Porsche was thinking ahead/globally.  My GT came from Florida and
was equipped for Calif. thus saving the $300 49-state reg. fee and no
grief during the smog check.  Well, less grief as alot of the smog shops
were scared to do the test to begin with on a 928, especially one
wearing race type banners on the windshield.

How can you process the title without paying for the car?  Crazy credit
union put you in a chicken and the egg situation.  This type of
roadblock might prevent you from buying any out of state car however
it's a good idea if the purchase stretches you financially in weird
ways.

There are lots of clean cars popping up from time-to-time so don't get
disappointed if this deal doesn't go through.  Is there anything special
about this car that warrants special attention?  Then it may be worth
the extra effort?

Good luck and let us know how it all works out!
Phil Tong
