Sorry to hear about your paint.  This is one of the most unfortunate
sides of having a nice car and I think is more common than people
realize.  I was at a classic car place here in Atlanta and a man came up
in a stunning Jaguar E type roadster with fabulous new red paint
complemented by an eight inch key scratch.  I know someone who bought a
new 1994 911 Speedster who was similarly rewarded in the first few weeks
of ownership.

 I waxed up my '81 Platinum 928 and took it out for dinner. 
Unfortunately,  an hour was all it took for some punk to key it to the
metal.
