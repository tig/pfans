 I have seen this, too.  In my case, it was a seal between the 
oil-separator housing and the block.  Try pulling the oil-separator out, 
and use a 10mm socket on the end of a long extension to tighten the nut 
at the bottom. You'll have to fish around a little the residual oil at 
the bottom, but it's there.  This is from memory, so YMMV.
