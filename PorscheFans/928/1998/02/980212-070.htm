	Great Question:

	Can anybody on the list come up with the Porsche recommended
belt tension
	in pounds, kilograms or whatever? There are probably several of
us on the
	list that can build a reliable tension gauge that could be sold
for a lot
	less than the Porsche part. I'll bet almost all of you would buy
one if it
	was $40 to $50 US. I have access to NC punching equipment for
manufacture
	if needed.

	Anybody? Leaonard? (maybe the torque could be measured from the
Porsche tool)

I was thinking of renting the Porsche tensioner and go purchase a belt
tensioner from Snap-on.  Get enough data points with the Porsche
tensioner and do a conversion / readout on the Snap-on.  This should
work.  Heard the Snap-on tensioner cost about $125 and is of
professional quality.  Jay, if you can pull off the manufacturing of
your own tensioner, I'll be your first customer!
