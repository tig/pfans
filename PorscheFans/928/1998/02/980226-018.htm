After a couple of months of lurking, I am finally in a position to make my
move and find the ideal 928. Like many of you, I remember lusting after
this amazing looking car 15 years ago (at a time when I wasn't interested
in cars and didn't know anything about them...). Now I am very interested
in cars and know a bit more about them - and I still want a 928 more than
anything else.... 

928s are relatively common here in England - I can pick up many of the
exclusive second-hand car magazines here and have a choice of 928s
from the very first to the last GTS. "My" car is a 928 S4 auto, dark blue or
grey metallic, with linen seats and, importantly, the limited slip diff.
Looking at two possiblities this weekend, (thanks to the knowledgeable
members of the list as I now know what to look out for, with promising
examples followed up by a shop inpection); maybe one of them will be
the one.....

Any recommendations from UK list members on specialists in London (or
cars for sale) highly welcome - I intend to use an independent Porsche
shop called CS Engineering, which was recommended by a colleague
who uses them for his racing 911- any thoughts from anyone else?

Just to add to the thread a few weeks ago on fuel prices...Here in
England (and in Europe in general) petrol is highly taxed (something like
70% of the pump price and rising every year) so filling up is always a
painful experience. Last time I filled up, I paid 65 pence a litre. If my maths
is correct, that is $4.00 per US gallon - 3 or 4 times the US price! That
hungry 928 V8 is going to make my wallet very lean :)

Looking forward to joining the 928 clan
