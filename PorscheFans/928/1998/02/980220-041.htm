Am reminded of an old joke, "An inch more a King, an inch less a Queen"
HAHAHA!!!

Ok, before this list denegrates to even lower levels... The 1/2" less
places the shifter more to my liking.  (BTW I really hated the early 911
shifters - felt like I was driving a school bus or something!)  I
thought long and hard before modifying that lever, believe me! Matter of
fact I hesistate to perform any other non-stock mods without carefully
considering the whole effect.  

It took Porsche years and millions to design the 928, then additional
years and millions to further refine it.  Any additional expenditure
from stock on my part is subject to the laws of diminshing returns - a
$900 chip might net me 10 HP, ditto on exhaust mod's in excess of $2k, a
$200 steering wheel creates all kinds of havoc with the airbag system,
etc. etc.  I guess either you go whole hog and end up with a 928 that
perhaps only the owner can appreciate or do your best with the status
quo.

And there certainly is nothing wrong with Porsche OEM spec!

T.G.I.F.  :)
