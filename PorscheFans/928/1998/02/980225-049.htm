Hello all,
Been away from the list for a few weeks and am trying to catch up.
Went thru all my 928 digests and deleted irrelevent (to me) information and
organized my 928 stuff. I have a briefcase file with all my 928 stuff in it
and it's divided into areas like electrical, fuel, cooling, ignition,
etc....and what I've done is reference each area to its relevent posts.For
example, cooling: see digest 105 - # 4 
I'm curious as to how you all keep track of the info relevant to your specific
cars?

Been very busy tinkering with ol' supercar lately........
Put a new Interstate battery in it last week as the old one had a bad cell in
it and was on it's last leg. ($40 cheaper than Porsche battery....an exact fit
and more CCA) ..... Can't complain though, as the last Porsche battery lasted
54 months.

Went thru entire car and cleaned all the electrical ground points....2 above
fuse panel, 1 under instrument pod,  2 coil strap to engine wires,  2 on the
right front engine bay, 1 on left front engine bay, 1 engine to body, and the
battery ground point. Others I missed?  Removed alternator and cleaned
connections on it and also starter connections.
Cleaned all misc. connections under the hood and also the positive connections
on the right and left front. (under hood)
Removed and cleaned every fuse, relay, and bottom row of connectors on the
fuse panel, along with the EZK and LH control unit connections and many, many
misc connectors under there and under the instrument pod. 
Everything really looked pretty good, with the exception of some of the ground
points being corroded and having some paint on the brass ground lugs. Ed
Croasdale had advised that cleaning the fuse panel connections was a good
preventative measure, and I just went a few steps further.....Thanks Ed.
Verified charging is well, however the guage still reads 13 to 13.5 volts when
it's really charging at 14 volts.  
Went thru the manuals and did all the EZK and LH tests that can be done
without the groovy diagnostic tool and oscilloscope, and all is well except
for the oxygen sensor which does have the correct voltage (between .1 and 1
volt) when running, but the voltage reading does not increase when throttle is
applied. (should increase)
Ordered one today from Vertex today for $119.50.
I've seen posts mostly saying that the oxygen sensor will not affect
performance, but I spoke to someone at the frenzy with an 87', and he said
that when he replaced his, it made a big difference. 
Does anyone have experience in this area, or would anyone care to enlighten
me?
Also checked ignition wire resistances, with all being in the 13.9 K ohm
range, except for the # 2 plug wire, which had infinite resistance. I
thought....that's it!....that's why I feel I'm a little down on power of late!
Upon further inspection of the wire I noticed that it was cracked completely
in two at the L where it goes into the spark plug extension section. Pulled
the plug and it was tan, clean, and dry. Hmmmm......come to find out, even
though the wire showed infinite resistance, it was still sending current.
(don't ask how I found this out......let's just say my hair's a little frizzy
today) I guess the current is easily jumping the break.
Needless to say, I ordered the OEM plug wires today also, along with Bosch
distributor and rotor caps.
Was going to try to get Magnecor wires, but tired of being the test goat for
them.
I do have a few questions though.....Do you guys think the wire could be a
reason why I feel a little down on power
or not? ....(I mean it is sending current, just that it's having to jump the
open part) Seems to idle steady and has no misses on acceleration.
What are your ignition wire resistances.....the manual says < 2.5 K ohms is
ok, but this may be earlier model specs. The car has nearly 76,000 miles on
it.....Is it due for wires, distributor caps, and rotors at this point?
If so, have any of you all noticed any difference when these items were
replaced. (usually when I put these items on an otherwise healthy car, I can
never tell a difference) 
Finally saw the shift-cup today.....ooooh, it's way up in there, isn't it?
(next project)
      
Apologies for the very long post......Hopefully some of it will be of
interest.....
Regards to all,
