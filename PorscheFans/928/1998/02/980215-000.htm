Do NOT use D&D - they messed up my front bumper and spoiler.  Actually
they turned out to be just middlemen and sub'd out the job, which I
imagine is a pretty common practice.  Find out first.  Also, I
underestimated just how dirty a car can get traveling uncovered.  
I never shipped a car before this one so let me offer these tips I
learned the very hard way:

1.  Read the contract & especially the damage exclusions BEFORE signing
anything or having the seller sign the car off to the shipping company.

2.  Upon arrival, carefully inspect the car (and test drive it which
doesn't apply here) and note ANY/ALL damage on bill/receipt BEFORE
signing off on delivery.  Matter of fact better re-read any document
they want you to sign as the delivery paperwork might not match the
contract.  (If you get the feeling you ought to be paranoid about this
you're right).

3.  If you must wash the car first cause it's soo dirty you can't see
the paint underneath better do it now because most of the fine print
let's the company off the hook for any damage 'not visible' due to road
grime, etc.  What a bunch of bullsh#t.

4.  Have delivery scheduled for DAYTIME so you can see the car in the
light of day.  I think it is a trick some companies use night time
delivery with the excuse of driver schedules.

5.  A good idea to check references / local BBB for complaints.

Proper transportation won't be cheap but if done right will save you
much grief later.  I am sorry to have used D&D when for just a few
hundred more could've have had a covered trailer and I bet much more
professional service than the "two clowns with truck" service I got.

Good luck - take it from here and let us all know how your shark hunt
turns out!
