Anthony - The Chilton book has some useful basic information about
your 928, but covers the wrong fuel injection system, has no
schematics, and could mislead you on some things (like how to
tell when the clutch is worn to the limit). Unfortunately the
next step is the factory shop manual, which costs about $275
(Steve Taub Porsche was selling them for $236 recently, don't
know whether they still are).

As to fuel, I use regular gas - 87 octane - in mine for street
driving and have never heard any knocking. To be on the safe
side I use premium on the track, but that's probably unnecessary.
