>>Is Red Line Water Wetter a recommended coolant system additive. I
bought a bottle planning on flushing and refilling my coolant  system
soon. Does anyone use it?

Water Wetter roughly doubles the heat transfer rate of water + coolant
mixture.  Works with coolant mixtures, or plain water (as used in
racing).  Most motorcycle road racers use it.  Side benefit:  has a
water pump lube and corrosion inhibitors in it.

If your car runs very hot, it can help bring the temp down as much as
15F.  928s seem to be pretty well cooled though, so you may not notice a
temp difference.  When I had a 1988 Lotus Esprit Turbo, it brought the
temp down 20C, but hey, those Brits never expect any car to be driven in
anything but fog and rain, so I guess it was way undercooled.

For tech details, look at www.redlineoil.com, and go to product info.
