Eduardo,

  A lot will depend on the condition of the car you buy.  Based on 
  experience with my current 928, I'm going to budget about $2K over
  the purchase price of my next 928 to handle fixing problems that might 
  arise over the first year or so of ownership.
  
  Here are some prices I've paid over the years:
  
  T-belt and waterpump change (parts & labor) - $750
  Clutch replacement (parts & labor) - $1400
  Brake master cylinder (parts only) - $175
  ultra high-perf tires (mail order & mnt/bal labor) - $800
  Fuel pump relay - ~$35
  engine oil change (8 qts of Amsoil ($6.80/qt) & filter) - $60
  front coupler on shift linkage - $45 plus 6 or 8 hours of my time
  
  The good news is that once you get a car into shape, it will be reliable.
  The worst problems with the 928 seem to center around the electrics; they 
  are complex and there are lots of switches and components with quality that
  doesn't seem to be on par with the rest of the car.  These will probably 
  require attention more often than the actual mechanicals. 
  
  Proper maintenance is the best way to keep this car in good shape
  running well for reasonable costs.
  
  Good luck with your decision.
