 928 Fans,

Finally caught up with some back to back to back major projects and life is
getting back to normal so I can indulge in my true passion once again.

I have missed everyone and hope all is well with you and your 928's.

From time to time I have been able to sneak a look at  the digest to make
sure Leonard is keeping everyone logarithmically correct, and  that Phil is
keeping everyone excited and enthused about our 928s. It is nice to see some
things never change ;-)

Just picked up a wrecked 86 928S ( major front hit) with only 62,000 miles
on it and it has many very nice parts available, including one of the most
perfect interiors I have ever come across . I will be putting together a
list on the next few days and will post it ASAP.  If anyone needs anything
for their 928 let me know. I will be finished disassembling the 86 over the
next couple of days.

BTW if anyone has an EXTRA LARGE Can opener I could borrow to get the engine
out of this 928, I would appreciate it.
