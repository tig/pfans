Well Carlos, you have options here.

Since it is a closed system, it's either the pump or the rack.
Unfortunately, since both are expensive, you want to pinpoint.
Replacement of the pump is easier than most domestic cars, and the part
is around $250 for a rebuilt unit.   Consider taking it to a mechanic
that can test the pressure/flow of the pump.   On the other hand, if it
must be towed, you may be money ahead just replacing the pump on your
own.   If you choose this course, make SURE you run plenty of fluid
through the system to flush out any suspended particles.

Rack failure often results in suspended metals, but the rack repacement
is much more involved and expensive even when done by yourself.  If the
rack is bad, and your 'new' pump installed, there is a risk of damaging
the new pump.   You can limit the risk by placing the return line in a
large container and keeping fresh fluid available in the pump while a
friend/companion/significant other starts the car and turns the steering
wheel.   For obvious reasons, this should be done as quickly as
possible..

If it were me, due to the age of your car (and your description), I'd
replace the pump myself and go from there.

Good luck whatever you decide - and let us all know how it turns out!
