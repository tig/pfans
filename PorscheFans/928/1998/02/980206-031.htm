The 928 uses a thermostatically-controlled silicone fluid cooling fan
clutch. By failing to move
enough air through the radiator, this clutch may well be responsible for
many of the high-temperature problems that we experience. Since a
replacement clutch costs $400 to $500, not
many of us will replace it on suspicion alone, and there isn't a test
that tell us whether it is good
or bad.

There is, however, a repair procedure for the clutch. This procedure is
not Porsche-approved, and
will not guarantee original performance of the clutch, but it will
greatly improve the performance
of a faulty clutch. I would expect this to take you one or two hours to
complete. Try the
procedure at your own risk. I don't know of any way that this could
damage your car, but if you
find a way to do so, don't blame me! YMMV!

1. Toyota uses a similar fan clutch, but they also sell silicone fluid
to refill their clutches. Go to
your Toyota dealer, and buy a bottle of this silicone oil. It should
cost $6 or $7 for a very small
bottle. You will also need a small quantity of silicone sealer (RTV),
and a heat source. The best is
a flameless hot air gun, but you might be able to use a propane torch if
you are VERY careful.

2. Remove your cooling fan, complete with fan, clutch, bracket and
pulley. No disassembly of the
fan unit is required except as detailed in Steps 4 and 5.

3. Carefully clean the fan unit, especially the front face of the
clutch, which faces the radiator.
Clamp the fan bracket to a work surface with the fan face-up in a
horizontal position, leaving the
fan free to rotate.

4. There should be a 1" x 3" piece of sheet metal across the center of
the clutch. This is a
bimetallic element. DON'T BEND IT! The strip is retained by slots cut
into the ribs on the fan,
and is kept from rotating out of the slots by small dabs of silicone
sealer (RTV). Remove the
RTV, and CAREFULLY rotate the strip slightly to free it from the ribs.
Remember which side is
up.

5. Under the strip should be a silicone rubber grommet, with a small
metal rod in the center of the
grommet. Remove the rod, being careful to not lose it. Remove the
grommet, being careful not to
tear it. Cut the tip off the bottle of silicone oil at the very end.

6. Heat the fan clutch while rotating the fan and clutch at a moderate
speed. Be careful not to
overheat and damage the fan. This expands the air in the clutch, and
moves the oil in the clutch to
the outer edges.

7. Remove the heat source. Continue to rotate the fan and clutch, and
drip the oil into the
grommet hole. The combination of cooling and rotation will pull the oil
in and distribute it to the
outer edges. When oil stops going into the hole, repeat the cycle of
heating and cooling. I suggest
using the entire bottle, since there is no way of knowing how much oil
is really needed.

8. Replace the grommet, and insert the metal rod. Carefully replace the
metal strip, being certain
to not bend it, and to get the right side up. Apply small dabs of RTV to
keep it from rotating.

9. Reinstall the fan unit. Please post any problems to the 928 List at
