Here is a bit of information to think about.  I have had my insurance
through Farmers Insurance since 1991.  Last month I recieved a letter
stating that I no longer fit the profile of the prefered insured of Farmers
Insurance company.  I have not filed a collision claim ever, nor a
comprehensive claim since 1994.  In 1996 I was in an accident in which my
vehicle was totaled, at the fault of the other driver.  My attourney filed a
$2500 PIP claim, (Personal Injury) to help cover my medical expenses, and
ultimately his fee's.  I dug into the statutes.  It is against the law to
cancel or non renew an insured because of a PIP claim.  I called the
regional office for Farmers, and after being very persistant, and at one
point I was nasty about it.  I told the underwriter I was speaking with if
he didn't explain why I didn't fit the profile, I would file a grievance
with the Texas Insurance Commission.  He finally told me that it was the
combination of the type of car and the location of my residence, that placed
me in the profile of a probable high comprehensive claim group.  As it turns
out several years ago there was a hail storm that did Milions of dollars of
damage in auto claims.  The Insurance compainies spend tons of money trying
to forcast where future claims will come from, and try to head them off
before they have to pay for them.  I think the only reason the underwriter
mentioned the hail damage from several years ago, is because the insurance
companies expect a really nasty season in the spring and they are going to
try to minimize their losses.  Anyway I called Gieco, and my coverage went
up, and my premiums went down.  Food for thought!
