  Many list members use these (often in conjunction with
  Weltmeister sport springs) and have had good results.
  For balance, I would replace all 4 vs just the rears.
  Koni shocks are adjustable.

  You need the specs from the manuals (which I don't have
  with me at the moment).

  Check to see if the car has an original style Paris-Rhone
  alternator.  If so, these alternators need all the help they
  can get, so it would be worth tracking down the pieces to
  put the cooling system back in place.
  
  If the car has had another brand of alt installed (e.g. Bosch),
  the cooling setup may have been discarded since it wouldn't be
  a direct bolt-on.  FWIW, I replaced my orig Paris-Rhone with a
  Bosch without the cooling setup and haven't had any problems.

  The 205s will fit the 7" wide rims, so there isn't a real
  safety issue as far as the tires coming unseated from the rim.  
  You're definitely losing out on performance with hard 205s though.
  If you want the performance Porsche built in to your car, go with
  good 225s.
