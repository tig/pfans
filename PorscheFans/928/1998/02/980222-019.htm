My understanding of the belt tension monitor system is that as long as
there isa constant pressure on the pulley, a contact is made.  If the
belt is loose, it would
wabble the pulley and the contact would be broken.  A thight slipping
belt
should not make the check light go on.

At least, that is what I could observe...
