Good idea!

That's what I thought, but Barry at Autosport, the people who work on my
car and are arguably the most knowledgeable independent Porsche fixers
around, told me (in terms of high vehemence) what I related to the list.

>Also, hadn't heard that the sealant aggravated the dissimilar metals problem.

Loctite is (a family of) relatively brittle adhesives, intended to keep
otherwise moveable parts from moving under vibration of thermal cycling;
don't use them if you primarily need a sealant.

>Should an anti-seize compound be used in lieu of Loctite?

Apples and persimmons again. Anti-seize compounds prevent (or at least
discourage) chemical reactions between metal parts, and so have some of the
dimensions of a grease.

>Gotta believe the factory used SOME sort of antivibration adhesive.

It's probably time to ask PCNA; they sometimes shed light when asked.
Meanwhile, a positive (though tedious) answer would be to drill and
safety-wire all the cute little bolts.
