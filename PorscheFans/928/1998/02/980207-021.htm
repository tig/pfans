Talk to Larry Reynolds (carcaresp@aol.com) from car care specialties.  I
talked to himat the frenzy and he told me that the gray paint on Porsche
wheels is Wurths and it is
available in spray can.  He has always been very helpfull and he is very
competent while
he never push stuff on you that will not work.

PS.  I don't get anything from Larry if he sells you something.  I just
think that we should
support people that are that dedicated at providing usefull
information.product at a good
price.
