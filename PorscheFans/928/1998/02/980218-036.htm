I fell in love the first time I saw a 928. My friends dad had a 928S4
guards red with a black interior. I was about 8 at the time. Now I am
18, (almost 19), and looking for an old shark. I'd love to get one now,
(make all the redneck 'stang and Camaro owners at school drewl), but I'm
not sure I could afford to maintain one. I have a 1991 SAAB 9000 5spd
now, it runs great and if treated nicely is cheap to maintain. Is a 928
the same way? I would like a 5spd, but would accept an auto. According
to my price research a 1985 is about the newest that I could afford a
nice one for, (I would be broke at the point of purchase). Are older
ones reliable? I want one that will run almost flawlessly, but I don't
mind some interior/exterior wear and tear. Does anybody have some good
advice for an economicly challenged 928 buyer? I live in Maryland but
would be willing to travel anywhere east of the Mississppi for a good
car if anybody has one for sale.
Has anybody looked at the 1985 928 Iris Blue auto at Sharp Shorts in New
Jersey?
