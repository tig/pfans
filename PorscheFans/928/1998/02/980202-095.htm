I have decided that I want to buy a Porsche, I always liked the =
appearance of the 928 body style over all the others.  However I've been =
reading and hearing contradictory things about the 928.  I've been told =
by some that the 928 is a lemon and the maintenance costs will eat me =
alive and by others that the 928 is no different than any other high =
performance car, that if I buy one that has been well maintained that I =
shouldn't have any more problems with it than any other car.  Which =
story is correct?

I want to buy a car that I can drive and enjoy without fear of =
constantly breaking down or driving me to bankruptcy.  Can someone =
please give me some realistic expectations on 928 ownership?
