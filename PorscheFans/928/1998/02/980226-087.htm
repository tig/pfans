Dear Friends:

In my last letter I explained how a tire mechanic had told me that the
lugs on my Porsche were made out of Titanium....well I was just informed
by a member that they are actually made out of aluminum alloy...oh
shoot, I was ready to try to take this baby up to 20,000 feet and fly
around the world in it.

Sorry for that little mistake!  But this car still rocks anyways...

I do have another question:  I tried to fill the windshield washer
resovoir the other day and when it got to full, water started pouring
out under the car...obviously there is a crack or a leak in the hose or
resovoir itself.

Are these washer fluid tanks hard to get out to replace, do I have to
take the front quarter panel off to replace it??

Mark
