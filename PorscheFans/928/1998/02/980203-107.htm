>There was a post awhile back from a concourse judge, who had his one remade
from lycra.  Where's that archive search engine ?--Andy McIntyre

That was I, fellow "land Shark tamers. When my cover gave up the ghost,  I
decided to try lycra as an alternative to the $950 cover from Porsche. I
bought two yards from a bolt of material at a fabric store for $35. I took
the old delapedated original cover and the new material to an automotive
upholstery shop. They charged me three hours of labor at $55 per hour. They
used the original zipper, snaps, bar, bungie cords and connectors. The also
provided a vinyl edging for the new material. As I said, I'm also a Concours
judge, and the $200 replacement looks very close to original. Since it's
lycra, it stretches in both planes with greater flexibility than OEM. Also,
it's about 50% lighter, so it doesn't sag as much either.

The owner's manual for my 86' 928S recommends using an octane rating of 92.
Since I have AutoThority Chips, I never ever use anything less than 93. On
other cars that do not need premium, you are most likely wasting your $$ if
you use it. However, if the engine knocks, then it may save it while you
find out why it does. On the 928 you are risking serious damage to the rings
and pistons if you use an octane that is too low. Don't be penny-wise and
pound foolish.

To bleed the brakes I use the two person method. I have a vacuum bleeder,
but I find it to be ineffective on the S4 brakes. The job is fairly easy,
but care is required to insure that air is not drawn into the system. Since
I use "ATE Super Blue" and alternate it with the "ATE Gold" (same formula
and boiling points) it is eazy to tell when the "new" fluid is replacing the
old. If you have never bled the brake system, pay to have it done, but watch
and learn.

Happy motoring. Ed
