Just got to say something!!   Surely it has to be rear shocks that have
gone soggy with age? (much like some of us!) They are obviously not holding
your rear end (car that is) down properly.
One of the simple checks for this if you don't want to ask a suspension
shop to check it, is simply to push down hard on one rear corner and then
let it spring back up. If the the back end rocks up and down for a bit,
then for sure your shocks are stuffed. But I really suggest the quickest
and simplest solution is get your neighbourhood (Porsche hopefully)
suspension expert to check.
It also sounds a bit like simple axle tramp, except that the suspension is
a leetle bit more sophisticated on a shark! Its not a Chev with an old beam
axle. Or for Andy in NZ, its not an old Kingswood!  (Oh no! Not the
Kingswood!) (OZ humour!)
The other possibility of course is that someone has installed shocks that
are way too stiff. That way you also get massive axle tramp effects. The
test for this is even simpler! You can't push a corner down at all! :)
On another slightly older thread, we were talking about wide tyres etc and
friction and all that. One thing that was not mentioned to those
contemplating really wide tyres is that sometimes the combination can be
affected by the law of diminishing returns. This applies when you put on a
tyre so wide that the suspension is actually incapable of keeping the
entire cross section on the road at high cornering loads. In this case one
side of the tyre actually lifts up and the end result of your wider tyre is
less contact area than you had with a narrower one.
