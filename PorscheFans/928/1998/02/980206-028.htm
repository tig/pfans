  I'd be surprised if the wheels were causing the fade.  Most likely, the
  brake pads aren't up to the task during an AX.  Check the archives earlier
  this week where John White posted the type of pads he was using for 
  street/track.  You might have better luck using something similar.
  
  In general, BBS wheels are lightweight high performance wheels although
  they've spun off another line called Moda that may not fit into the "racing"
  catagory.  I can't believe that your mesh wheels would restrict air flow
  any more than the stock forged wheels used exclusively from '83-'88.
