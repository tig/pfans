David,

I don't believe that Recaro is or was owned by Porsche, but Porsche did buy a
part of them.

Back when making the 356, Porsche couldn't keep up with the demands. They
outsourced (as we call it now) some of the body production. (That also
happened during some of the 911 years). Through the years, Porsche used
various suppliers. By the way, the emblem just behind the right front wheel on
356's identifys the body builder. At any rate, one of those companies Porsche
used for 356 bodies was called Reutter Karosserie ( I think Karosserie means
carraige or coach builders). Reutter was founded in 1906. It had a coach
building branch and a seat building branch. With the development of the 911
and the large capital investment required for tooling, Reutter management
decided to sell the coach building branch to Porsche. That happened in July
1963. With the seat building business, Reutter formed the Recaro company. The
name Recaro was created by combining the "Re" from Reutter and the "Karo"
which was changed to "Caro" from Karosserie. 

Today, Recaro supplies seats to most of the German car makers. They provide
the slick after market sport seats that most of us know them from as well as
many of the standard Porsche seats.

I hope that helps,
