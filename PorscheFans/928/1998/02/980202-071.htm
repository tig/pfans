Buon giorno, Millo from Milano!  Welcome to our eclectic group!

Did you hear the results of the 24 Hours of Daytona?  Forza Ferrari!!

Before attempting to answer some of your questions, let me first
recommend that you hit Phil Tong's web site:  www.928s4vr.com.  You'll
find more info than you can use!

As to gasoline prices, we're near that number...only per gallon (about 4
ltr., as I guess you know).  From my travels in Italy, your price
includes a very high tax.  That's the main reason for such a difference.

Sounds like you've a lot of work ahead of you.  The hail (yes, you
correctly translated) damage will be quite a task.

In answer to the specific questions, herewith my offering:
	1.  Other Euro members - watch the list.  Your posting was on the same
day as a fellow from Holland.  We've got folks from the UK, Germany,
Denmark and Finland, as I recall.
	2.  Wiring diagram - buying the shop manual from DEVEK is one option. 
Get DEVEK's info from Phil's site.
	3.  The "!" is a warning device, as you've no doubt surmised.  Pushing
it turns it off if the fault is minor.  Again, you need the shop manuals
for more info.
	4.  Can't help you on the seats, mine are manually adjusted.
	5.  Ditto the Sunroof, mine's like yours. 
	6.  The fuse box is in the passenger footwell, behind a _wooden_ panel
that is under the carpet.  Yes, hard to believe, but it IS functional.
	7.  If the fan problem isn't fuse related, ask the list again.

Hope you enjoy the list.  I KNOW you'll enjoy the car.

Ciao and Best regards,
