I race a dinghy and have to check rig tension regularly. The tool for 
this costs around GBP20 (say 30USD). The basic design could probably 
be used on the cambelt. If someone wants to try making one, just go to 
a chandler and have a look or buy a rig tension gauge. I don't know if 
you could just modify the standard tool - I am measuring around 350lb 
on the boat.

The tool comprises two strip of metal, joined at one end so they can 
spring apart and back. One is bent at right angles at the end and has 
a calibration scale. The end where they are joined hooks onto the wire 
(belt). The outer strip is then pulled away until the inner strip 
reaches a fixed point on the scale. The tension is then measured by 
how far the wire has moved on the scale.

Being based on a spring, this wears over time, but is good for several 
hundred measurements.

I take no resonsibility if anyone tries it! My local Porsche 
specialist did mine.
