My indicator did tell me that my belt was loose and it did
so accurately.  Both prior to changing the belt and ~1000 miles
after the belt was changed.  Since then the light has been quiet
(and I have not experienced any t-belt related problem...)

My opinion is to plug it in.  See if it works.  If it does, good.
If you think it does not, you can always unplug it again.
