There is a special point for mesuring the heigh of the car.
Maybe Brian, with is new digital camera, can send you (and me 
for the FAQ) the location of the suspension adjstment height.

You should replace the tube.  Mine is not the original type
but a tube from an aircraft (bought from Zimms in Texas).
The tube will limit the amount of water that might enter the
alternator (really important ??) but will also create a 
good flow of air over the temperature sender mounted inside
the front left fender (this is used by your interior temperature
controller).

If the tire fit, I would keep them there for a while.  Just
don't push the car too much in corners.  Your traction will
be limited do to the tire footprint and hard compound.
