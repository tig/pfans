The high-silicone aluminum block (Alusil) was developed by Reynolds in
the USA. GM adopted it for the Vega, which was intended as a high-tech
but inexpensive compact auto. The engines got a terrible reputation,
largely because they would lose their coolant, and since there was
virtually no warning system, the owner would fry the engine. The Vega
also had a massive cast iron cylinder head sitting on a very
light-weight aluminum block - not one of Generous Motors' best ideas.
After GM put a coolant loss warning system on the Vegas, their
reliability increased, but their reputation didn't improve. A common fix
was installing cast-iron sleeves and standard pistons, but the silicone
bores could be refurbished with a chemical brush honing process (as can
the 928's bores).

Reynolds got into Can-Am racing as a means of advertising the process,
and cast some BIG-block Chevy engine blocks. Some of these were well
over 500 cubic inches. These ruled the class until Penske and Porsche
brought in the Turbo-Panzers and so dominated the class that the series
died.

The 928 uses the same process. Apparently, Porsche and Reynolds did
their homework well, as the blocks show excellent wear characteristics.
