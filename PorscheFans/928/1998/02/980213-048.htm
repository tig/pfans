Sharkers,

	It is that time again, but this time I am at a loss. I need to put
new tires (all 4) onto one of my machines, a mercedes 2-door SEC, a
heavy beast at 3700 lbs. While I do not autocross it (though I might
give it a try this year) I do drive it hard on the street.

	The car is my everyday driver, running the range daily (no pun
intended - a little texas humour :) of residential streets to 75-80
mph heavy traffic beltway travel to 80+ mph interstate between
houston,dallas and san antonio, in all kinds of weather.

	Tires I am considering (mostly because I know of them) are the 
Michelon Pilot series (XGT-V4?), the Bridgestone RE-71 (cheap), Yoko 
AVS Intermediates and the Continental CZ91. Size needed is either 
205/65-15 (the factory size) or 215/60-15.

	Long tread life is not my major concern, but very good dry traction
AND very good wet traction is. Living in Houston we get alot of rain
and have our share of flood streets pretty regularly. So shedding
water is very important to me. Being quiet is a plus too.

	What are the lists thoughts on the above choices? Is there a better
recommendation that I have overlooked? Has anyone used the
Continental CZ91's on a car? I am open to other suggestions 
as well. I checked out Tire Rack's web site, but according to them 
ALL of there tires are the greatest.

	Sorry for the non-porsche content but I figure you guys are the 
professional experts on performance tires on heavier (sorry, I mean 
it in a relative kind of way) cars.

thanks for your time,
