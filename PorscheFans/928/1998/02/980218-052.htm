Not really.  It's a high-strung, precision piece of machinery that, though
very reliable when properly maintained, can be very expensive when
something breaks.  After all, an '85 is a 13 year old car and there are
lots of little (but not necessarily cheap) things that may need replacement.

IF you can find a 928 that has been well cared for, it will probably be
very reliable.  However, you'd be taking a big risk that something may go
wrong and it may be very expensive to repair.  If you're handy with a
wrench, the car really is not too hard to work on yourself, but there are
some things better left to a pro.  I don't mean to diminish your enthusiasm
- just want you to understand what you may be getting into.

If you decide to go for it, don't try to save money by getting a beater.
You'll pay more for a good one but you'll come out ahead in the long run.
