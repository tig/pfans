Graham,

  A Hershey bar is a chocolate bar traditionally produced by the Hershey 
  Chocolate Company in Hershey, Pennsylvania USA.  Some may argue that their
  chocolate isn't as good or as exotic as other brands like Ghirardelli's,
  but since I can at least eat a Hershey bar without getting a headache, I
  don't classify it as "cheap" chocolate, and that suits me just fine.  They 
  also have (had?) a neat amusement park that I used to go to when I was a kid.

  Did you know that the glove box in your 928 is air conditioned specifically
  to keep your chocolate bars cool?  Honest!  You will find this factoid
  written in factory brochures for the 928.
