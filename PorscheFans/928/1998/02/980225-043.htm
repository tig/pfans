Howdy from Texas, folks!

I'm new to the list, having discovered the archives just recently. I am
planning a springtime restoration of my 1986 928S, which I have had for a
little over three years now, and I am soliciting advice and other's
experience in similar efforts.

The body on the car is extremely sound, with one very minor and not
noticeable "ping" (a round "ding") on the far front passengar side
quarterpanel. I will certainly have this fixed when time comes for
painting. The paint was in fair condition when I bought the car, and moving
to a new house in an area with moderate construction has not helped it in
the last year and a half. Several small (1/8") bubbles have started along
the driver's side window seams, exposing all the way down to the metal.
Needless to say, I'm chagrined and it's time for some work.

The budget: let's say in the ballpark of $5,000 signed, sealed and delivered.

What I want to avoid: the new paint/old car look that can result from
putting a fresh paint job on a 12 year old vehicle.

Desired color: the incredible midnight blue which I've seen on a number of
911's. The car is currently Marine Blue Metallic, which can look like a
hazy purple when viewed in the wrong light. I dislike the purple hue, and
want to make sure that the new paint is blue from all angles/all lighting.

Here's what I figure I have to do, and here's where anyone who's done it
can help me:

1) new paint (duh!). I intend to go to a high-end shop; my mechanic has a
highly recommended shop which they use.
2) replace/refurbish all exterior rubber within reason (rear "bumpers",
window seals, sunroof seal etc.)
3) new mirrors driver/passenger side, painted with the car
4) replace/refurbish front spoiler (or just remove and not replace -
thoughts?)
5) replace/refurbish rear spoiler
6) polish wheels - they are not in good shape (hazy shine)

What am I missing? Is there any way to do anything to the metal trim around
the rear side windows (repaint it black)? Can anything be done to the
otherwise sound rear and front spoiler to restore the finish (both are
classic ultraviolet sun damaged - look great with protectant on them for
about a week).

Is the budget reasonable? I figure half or more of the figure will go to
the paint job alone, and as I add up part prices for bumpers and seals, I'm
well into the hundreds and approaching a thousand dollars, even without
ponying up for new spoilers front and rear (likely to be $700-$1k right
there).

I love this car- it has just under 80k miles on it and has been a
wonderfully reliable vehicle for me since the day I bought it. I'm ready to
pretty it up so that the next three years will be as good or better than
the last three.

Thanks in advance for any sage advice anyone can offer. I appreciate it-
and so will the car!
