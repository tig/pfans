What a nice compliment!  

928 fans and especially everyone on the 928 list are the best.  The
collective knowledge is immense whether you're talking concours
preparation or maintenance or those on the bleeding edge of racing
endeavors.  This is indeed where it's at and there are so many names to
add to your roster - we probably have the most useful forum auto-wise on
the net today - one look at any other auto NG proves that.  You should
see the @#%$!#% out there!  WIth PEEPO POstInG MEssAgeS LYK DIs I wonder
why anyone subscribes let alone how in the heck they read it!  Arrghhhh!

Aren't they the best!?!  That shop definately has 'soul' echoing about
long after the last ignition cycle of a 928 engine in the service bay. 
Hmmm.  I need to pass by soon to recharge!

Anyhoo, great thread Alex.  I could only imagine if every listmember
posted just one message each per day.  I think my Windows pc would just
frag!  But yes I wouldn't mind hearing from the 'quieter' folk, hey you
all have to unlurk sometime!  Or not :-)

Ok, back on the move - no rain today yippee!

Phil
