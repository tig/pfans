The list has a special affinity for correctly used apostrophes. It's a
historical thing, a little like sports seats.

True, but there's some real fanatics on this list who care more about not
getting a paint chip in their door over the deforestation of Brasil, so you
have to take that into account. :^)

Only 2? Jeez, you'll have to try harder!

Don't even _think_ about implying that!

We're all Australasians, but NZer's are not Okkers, and Ozzies aren't Kiwis.

You are an American, as are your friends in Mexico and Bolivia who all live
in continental America. You aren't from the U.S., that's all.

Spotya, mate.
