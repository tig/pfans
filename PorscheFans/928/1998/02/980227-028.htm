(Stephanie wrote)  However, if you ever take apart a 911 race engine,
Porsche use smaller titanium nuts.  ie, if you would normally put an M10
with a 13 mm socket, the titanium nut would only be 12 mm.  Now that's
what I call weight saving program!!

Did anybody see on Speedvision the Ferrari owners driving event in Italy
(it was a recent event, started raining and some cars quit, that English
narrator guy who I think has a significant Ferrari racing background
helped get a race car going) ANYWAY, along the same lines they showed a
50's race car that had holes drilled in the little bitty aluminum gear
shift gate for weight savings.  The narrator's comment was rhat the
savings would be cancelled if the driver "had a decent breakfast that
morning"
