When I read Lee Hamilton's thread on the illegal road block, and having to
take his car off the road to miss it, I thought about the friend who came
back from wilderness camping.  As he was unpacking, I noticed a loaded
pistol..."You camp with THAT?" I asked.  "Up in the Allagash, he replied
calmly, you never know what or who you might meet."

Anyway, I think that Lee should be able to repair or replace the belly pan
for $500, so it is unlikely that insurance surcharges will be a problem.
Also, since there will be a police report on record, PERHAPS Lee can
convince the insurance company that his shunt off the road was caused by a
road obstruction, and therefore, should be considered a comprehensive loss
and NOT a collision.  This "non-moving" accident classification, should not
cause a surcharge anyway.

Anyway, when I was an insurance agent, that is what I would have tried to
get the insurance company to call it...comprehensive loss...like striking a
deer, for example.

Let me know what happens, Lee, I would like to know the outcome, and the
name of the sleazy insurance company, also.  Just for my own information.
