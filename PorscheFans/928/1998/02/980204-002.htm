I had some trans. work done recently, and the
transmission had been readjusted by their Benz
expert. It shifted later than normal. He easily
readjusted it to shift when I wanted it to, so I'm
assuming there is a good amount of adjustability
there.
--------------------------------------------------------------

I chose the 928 for a combination of aesthetic and
functional reasons. The 928 is a functional looking
shape aerodynamically, yet is not so on paper. Which
has better aero, 911 or 928? The 911, to me, looks
like a swoopy VW bug. A perfect shape for generating
lift. Yuck. On the topic of Porsche's in general, I
had a 280z w/flares and a whale tail. People kept
thinking it was a Porsche. I got a license plate
frame saying, "No, it's NOT a Porsche", so for me to
get one was quite a departure from my beliefs about
the marque and it's owners. It was only the
functionality and aesthetics of the 928 that won me
over. You wouldn't catch me dead in most other
Porsche models.

The rear wiper should only wipe 4 times or so,
before shutting off.
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are separate warning lights for the pad
sensors and the fluid sensor. My fluid sensor has
been flashing uncontrollably for a few weeks.
Bypassing the sensor has not helped. (Reservoir
full) I probably need to disconnect the battery to
reset the computer. The temp. fix for a flashing
light is a piece of electrical tape.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I just checked the color sticker in my door...
"Scheiffer Blau Metallic"  Claudia Schiffer?
How could they have known?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to get; and I quote,
"...kissed in the ass by a couple of strippers
putting makeup on in the rearview..."
My rearview, though... Now that would show
dexterity!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I think any stray gasket material would end up in
your heater core.

'83 Euro 928S
Paid cash, Prolong seething in my engine as we
speak.
(Now worried, although it seemed pretty a pretty
innocuous additive at the time.
You sure feel nervous carrying that much cash
around, but the seller insisted.
I was waiting for the Murphy's law of robberies to
come into play.)
