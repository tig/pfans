OK, I now have a quite plausible answer from Loctite, specifically Robert
A. Valitsky, the Manager of Technical Communications for their North
American Engineering Center (call 1-800-LOCTITE for more info), who was
familiar with your call and the e-mail from Jim and me, and called just now
to tell me the following:

Loctite's removable products are affected by what Loctite calls the
"engagement ratio" of the threaded parts. This is the ratio of the length
along the parts in which Loctite winds up to the diameter of the thread.
Their specs assume an engagement ratio of 0.8, reasonable for a nut
threaded over a stud.

In the 928 oil pan scenario, where the bolts are long and skinny, the
engagement ratio may be five times this. A high engagement ratio leads to a
high torque for breaking loose the film of Loctite. For ratios this high,
the breakaway torque may exceed what can be provided by hand tools, or is
safe for the bolt. In such a case, Loctite generally recommends heating the
bolt to about 450 F, but this is inadvisable with an aluminum block.

Loctite's bottom line is that it's not a good idea to use their product in
this application, not because of any chemical reaction between steel,
aluminum, and Loctite, but because the Loctite may be impossible to break
loose without damage.

So, check the bolts whenever you're in their neighborhood, and consider
safety wiring if you're really worried.

the dealer told me that PORSCHE doesn't suggest any additive(Oil, Gas or
other) other than regular oil changes
a PORSCHE Mag(USA) source wrote that Chevron Techron was ok to use
also keep in mind the octane rating listed in your manual

Subject: Engine additives...?

Hearing the engine oil debate has raised another question for me....What =
about engine oil additives to help protect at start-up.....ex.  Slick =
50, Dura Lube (or any other space shuttle tested protector? :) )
Will these help, hurt, or waste your time and money ..... anyone want to =
share some knowledge/experiences?

Subject: Intermittent Starting Woes - Part Deux

Firstly a problem recap for new list members:

My 91 S4 occasionally just won't start at all.  The immobiliser seems to 
turn off okay, all the ignition lights come on, but turning the key has 
absolutely no effect - the dash lights don't even dim.  Leaving the car 
for 15 minutes or so seems to work - eventually it starts no problem, 
but this is becoming really infuriating and I'm dreading the time it 
happens on a petrol station forecourt in front of queue of impatient 
Porsche enviers.  Has anyone ever pushed a 928 single-handed?

Well, the car's at the dealers (AFN) today and I've just got off the 
phone to them.  They can't replicate the problem and they've said they 
can't find anything wrong.  The service manager said:

"Maybe one of the numerous electronic brains is malfunctioning 
somewhere, you'll have a job tracing it if it is and replacement will be 
big money..."

Sooo, the question is, do any of you know which if any of the "brains" 
might be affecting the starter circuit?  

I still think the immobiliser may be at fault, but if this isn't the 
only black box sat between ignition switch and starter motor, then who 
knows?

My thanks to  people who've already suggested culprits - I've told the 
dealers to replace the starter solenoid and deactivate the auto gearbox 
inhibitor switch (I've already replaced the battery and cleaned the 
ground connections). 

Anyone?

Dan (rapidly losing the 928-happy-glow)
