Hola All,

I know that I've asked this question before, but I beleive I inadvertantly
trashed that day's digest, so here goes...
Under light acceleration, the "Belt Tension" light comes on. When this first
occured, I immediately pulled into a Porsche service establishment where they
let the motor cool and retensioned it. Several days later the same thing
occured. My mechanic checked the belt and found all up to spec. The belt was
replaced  30k ago and is no more than 2 yrs old. But the light is driving me
goofy...!  Any ideas, comments, or adviso's ?

I'm seeking advice on this subject also:

I had the light come on in my '86 32 valve and took it to a garage where
they discovered the bottom  belt pulley almost hanging off.  Even though
they had replaced the belt the year before for the previous owner the cost
was $1000 to replace it again.  Over the past year the light has returned
to haunt me and has been retensioned twice - at no cost.  They say that
each time the tension was within the tolerences.  Now it has returned
again.  At 4000rpm - into the fun zone - blink, it's back.  Any suggestions
would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers.
