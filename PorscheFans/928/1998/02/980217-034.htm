Who said that? (curious) 

 Although I can imagine if the unit or it's components should fail,
finding the expertise to properly test/service and repair the diff could
be troublesome (just take a look at the service manual procedures!
yipes).  I have yet to check the fluid level in the tank, which I
suppose is why I have been getting the 'Differential Lock Off' warnings
even though the PSD is operating normally once underway (nice green
light feature).  Also, the green light illuminates periodically when I
don't think it should but it's supposed to take some of that guesswork
out of the equation anyways.

IMO the PSD allows control of the car's tail-out attitude during hoon
demonstrations much better than a non-PSD car, but I have spun with it
active so there is no completely making up for lack of driver talent or
overzealous activity!  44psi in the rear tires no doubt added to the
situation and I now run much more understeer oriented pressures.

FWIW even if the PSD is troublesome I think the S4/GT or GTS that comes
along with it would make up!
