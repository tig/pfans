Hi All,
        I just thought I would share a story, I was at a restaurant last
night and I parked on the far side of the parking lot to avoid getting
dinged and I took a window seat to watch out for my baby. When a group
of "hoons" on skate boards were passing by my car I started to get
nervous, Then when they started to peek into my baby I got really
paranoid (I had my CD case with about 100 CD's on the seat) and I
actually went just see what they where up to. All they were up to is
they liked the car and just wanted to check it out, But I saw that there
was a sign saying "bank parking only all unauthorized car's will be
towed" so I used it as an excuse to move my baby right in front of my
view at the restaurant. I went back into the restaurant to enjoy my meal
but as soon as I sat down a car pulled right beside my baby and
proceeded to slam there door hard into my drivers side mirror. Luckily I
didn't overreact and I waited till after dinner to check for damage and
there was not any damage so I guess all is well. I think in the future I
will just park on the far side of the parking lot and hire a sniper to
"shot to kill" if anyone try's anything funny.
