After reading the posts on the list over the last couple of days,  I
thought I'd share my limited experience.  After posting that my voltmeter=

would fluctuate in the 12-14 range,  several members e-mailed back statin=
g
that theirs did the same and that it was normal.  I then went and did a
post purchase inspection at DEVEK to see what would need to be taken care=

of soon and Mark told me that the car has some ghosts that I should not
worry about.  The voltmeter runs 13.5-14 during the day and 12-13 at nigh=
t
under load.  It will also spike every once in a while but the car starts =
up
all the time and the spike is intermittent.  While test driving the car h=
e
put it through its paces and it feels very good to have someone experienc=
ed
check out your vehicle to make sure everythig is in order.  Now when I st=
ep
into it and take it to the redline and when cruising at high (safe) speed=
s,
 I feel very comfortable knowing that I have a solidly engineered and wel=
l
maintained car under my seat.  This car is a joy.  i am happy and saddene=
d
at the same time to know that the list has grown to 1000 members.  It mea=
ns
that demand is increasing and we all know about supply and demand.
