I believe I read somewhere (probably in the owner's manual) that the
electronic fuel injection/computer chip can give off frequency signals that
will set-off garage door openers.  Has anybody ever experienced the same
problem with car alarms?  Every morning when I drive in to the parking
garage at work, several car alarms start going off as I drive by, the same
thing happens when I start my car in the evening.  I would like to think
that the low frequency rumble of the 928 exhaust is so earthshaking that it
wreaks havoc on the motion sensors of some car alarms, but I have to think
that it is probably related to something else.  Perhaps they are trembling
due to their fear of sharks?!  Anyone have a similar tale?

Ed and other NoVa area 928 owners - I'm definitely planning to be at the P3
Expo on Jan. 31st (just a block from my office).  Hope to meet some of you
folks in person.
