Is this the original key?  Some people have experienced some problem
with the
key wearing out.

ANother problem could be a dirty lock.  All those little piece inside
the lock
can get dirty and if they do not slide correctly, the lock will not
open.  On my 85,
my nes master key worked on every lock except the drivers door.  I took
the
tumbler out of the door and cleaned it as best as I could.  You then
should put some
light oil to ensure proper operation for years to come.

PS you might be able to clean the lock while its in place...
