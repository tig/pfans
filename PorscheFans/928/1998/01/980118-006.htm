I don't know what the recommended procedure is but:

The key slots into the key head and is held in place by spring
pressure against a sliding plastic rod.  What you have to do is lever
back the rod against the spring and the key will slide out of the
head.  There may be a away to do that from the outside, but I just pry
off the top being careful not to lose the battery, spring etc.  Once
you pry off the top you'll see what I describe.  The rod is at a 45
degree angle to the key.  Pull it away from the key and slide the key
out of the key head.


Above description is of course applicable to the lighted key head for
the 91 GT.
