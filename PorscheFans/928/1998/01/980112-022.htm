They are both suspect.  Windshield antennas are notorious for poor
reception. In addition, the =91Reno=92 unit in now dated when compare=
d to
modern tuners.  I also experienced poor reception in my =9184 which h=

=93Monterey=94 unit.  The reception was terrible even though the car =
has a good
antenna mounted on the fender.  I tried several units including Kenwo=
od,
Sony, and Alpine models before settling on a Blaupunkt =93Denver=94. =
 The
Blaupunkt has the best tuner performance of the bunch and was a vast
improvement over the factory unit.

You probably won=92t have much success using an antenna booster.  The=
 problem
is that the windshield antenna design produces a low Signal-to-Noise =
Ratio
(SNR). Ordinary boosters won=92t help because they amplify the noise =
along
with the signal.  In some cases, a booster may allow you to pick up
stations that would otherwise be out of range but they almost never i=
mprove
signal quality. I have seen some advertisements for boosters that cla=
im to
improve SNR, but they are usually expensive.  I suspect that they use=
 the
same technology that is used in any modern tuner.

The advice from the audio shop is probably good. Your best bet is to
replace the =93Reno=94 with a new unit.
