Howard,

  You mention that you need to replace the rears.  My experience with
the 928 has been NOT to mix and match different tires front to rear.
I've tried just buying the rears a couple of times since the fronts
seemed o.k., and each time, I ended up having to buy fronts within
a _very_ short period of time.  The reason is that the car started
to track very poorly when there was new rubber in the back and old
up front.  If you ever get to the point where your alignment appears
to have gone away, check the front tires - even if they don't seem
completely worn out, they may need to be replaced due to the fact that
the rubber has gotten hard with age.

  FWIW, I'm currently running Pirelli P700Z (with the Porsche N0
designation).  They came on a set of wheels that I bought, and although
I wouldn't have purchased them on my own, they have turned out to be
a good tire.  I've used them at the track in both wet and dry and have
concluded that they have very predictable behavior; not the ultimate
in dry traction, but a good all-around high performance tire.  I'm not
sure whether the P700Z is even available in 928 sizes anymore.
