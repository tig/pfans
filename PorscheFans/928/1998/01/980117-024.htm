Porsche spelled this out in their publication WKD 495 921, "928 GT '89
Information Technik" (thanks again, David), which lists the following
differences between the S4 and GT:

- higher output engine (326 v. 316 SAE bhp via tweaked pistons, cams,
computer programs)
- faster idle (775 v. 675 rpm)
- higher red line (6800 v. 6600 rpm)
- shorter gearing
- lighter (and noisier) exhaust system with two small tailpipes
- 40% LSD standard
- 20 mm shorter shift lever
- 8" f and 9" r forged Club Sport wheels
- wider front and rear track (17 mm spacers at rear)
- spacers to increase rear track

The suspension, however, is straight S4: GT cars are supplied with standard
running gear, including shock absorbers. Boge gas pressure shock absorbers
can be ordered as optional extra equipment (M 474) for entry of the car in
sport racing events."

Greetings,
   I am replacing my center consouole and was wondering what the vacuum
attached to the consoule is for?  Do I need it if I am replacing the consoule
from one with an S4?

thanks,

If you are talking about the lighted key head I can't tell you how to change
it out but I know it can be done, because I bought a new one and the parts guy
went in the back with my key and came out with the new key head attached in
like 5 min or less.

Dr. Bob,

I have the 10 speaker MB Quarts in my '94GTS.  I was wondering if those were
stock or not.  PO put in an Alpine amp in the back next to the CD changer
which is powering the speakers, and takes up room.  Because of the amp I
thought maybe the speakers were aftermarket....guess not.

You will have to have one small CD changer to put in that slot you are talking
about, and you will probably have to take out the tool kit too.  Good location
otherwise though.
