Quite the contrary; it shows that you take your admirable car seriously in
all things, large and small.

....which have almost no real value. The only person they are likely to slow
down or inconvenience is you; an halfway competent thief will not be
stopped by them. The Gordian solution (and mine as well, and I'm a fussy
guy) is to lose the locks (well, OK, mine are on a shelf in the garage in
case I should ever lose my mind and/or compete in a serious concours) and
use nice fresh lug nuts (yes, they get tired, and should be replaced when
you buy new wheels).

It does make a difference because the lock weighs a lot more than a nut.
Even though it's a short distance from the center of the wheel, it still
contributes to unbalance and they've taken some steps to mitigate this. If
you're going to use to suckers, follow the directions.

Then what's this about 17" wheels (which work really well on an S4)?
