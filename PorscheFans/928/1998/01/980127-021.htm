=09 Talking to my Porsche mechanic last night, he told me that in
their wisdom, the BMW engineers designed the 740 and 750 series engin=
es
with the air intake on the bottom of the block, driven by a vacuum
boosted system.=A0 Why they did this is a mystery, at least to me. Bu=
t
they have apparently had a recall on the 750s and possibly one on the
740s regarding the induction system.

=09 At this point, it seems that Capt. Nemo, my son in law, is
covered by the flood damage provision in his policy, but it he isn't,=
 it
may be covered by BMWs warrantee.

=09So much for the genius of German=A0 engineering.
