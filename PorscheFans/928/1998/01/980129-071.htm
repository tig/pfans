I figured I'd combine posts to save space.

On the lightening of the 928 topic: Why not just
accept the 928 as a luxury sedan with a serious
punch at the top end? It isn't a race car. Buy a
motorcycle for light weight/quick steering, and
awesome acceleration. You could buy a bike faster
than your reflexes for the same amount your car will
depreciate when you rip out the AC/etc. There are a
lot of other cheap sports cars you could get as
project vehicles. You could strip *them* down, but
avoid mangling a nice 928.

On the topic of the turn signal strangeness: At the
high labor cost you mentioned, decide if it isn't
worth your while to replace a few things yourself.
If the cost of a new flasher relay is $20, it's
probably worth it to buy it and throw it in. Many
shops use the "replace everything until it works"
strategy anyhow, rather than doing the proper
troubleshooting. Then they tell you all the parts
were bad... It's a pretty simple strategy. You can
do it yourself! But the labor is free...

Here's a question about proper
heating,ventilation,and air conditioning (HVAC)
operation:
I went through an expensive set of repairs to have
my dash pulled, heater core replaced (windshield
slime), and control box rebuilt. Now that everything
works, I am wondering if it is all working properly.
When my lower lever is in the far left "off"
position, I get no fan, but dependent on the upper
temperature setting, I get a "flow" of hot or cold
air from my vents. It's just airflow, but is the
"off" position supposed to close down the flaps on
the system altogether, or is the car continually
"climate controlled". How is this system actually
*supposed to* operate?
