Ok, let's start from the beginning.  When Mike posted the message for
the IRC chat that started all of this, it was for the sole purpose of
getting all of us together to chat because we have a common interest.
Then Marc had to bring in his "information" which has nothing to do with
IRC, 928's, or Porsches for that matter. Period.  If someone asked about
"speedman" or something , then that would be different, but nobody did.
again I say Period!  Why air your sour grapes when Mike was just trying
to do something positive with his post.  I am certain there are people
on this list that know Speedman.  And those people know that many of
those things Marc said were simply untrue.  So in my mind that
discredits Marc's entire story.  While I was a police officer I learned
there are three sides to EVERY story, .. yours, mine, then then the
truth.  In any event, this list is no place for that.

As for the statement that I should listen to someone that has been on
the list longer?  Well I hate to say it, but none of you know who I am,
or how long I have even been a porsche owner, then my question would be,
what difference should that make? NONE.

So if name calling is what this list is all about, then I don't need
it.  See,  I don't have time for judging other people.  Especially after
only hearing one side of the story from one person.

Now I am done with this subject, so any further personal mail telling me
"I'm wrong" will simply be filtered out.  Let's talk about 928's or
let's have the maturity to not talk at all.
