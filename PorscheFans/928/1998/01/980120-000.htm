<< At present there is no magazine that pays very much attention to the big
 brother of the 911. The 928 is treated like the cousin that is overweight
 and unemployed. It may get a mention now and then, but it seems like that's
 done out of politeness. Perhaps the lack of 928 coverage is partly our
 fault. Most 928 driver's don't do anything special with their cars. Kim
 Crumb, Mark Anderson, Susan Kirby and Marc Thomas are the exceptions. There
 are more of course, but they can be counted on your four limbs. >>

Ed and fellow shark fans.,

Hopefully the lack of magazine coverage is about to change.  Me and my
partners are going to press this week with the first new Porsche enthusiast
publication since Excellence.  The magazine is called Stuttgart Magazine and
will be published 10 time per year out of Charlotte, NC.  Our main focus will
be everyday enthusiast's cars, modified cars, restorations with a smattering
of race cars.  Since I am a life long 928 fan there will be coverage of this
under appreciated model along with the other models that get less than their
fair share of press.   I welcome your input in making this happen.
