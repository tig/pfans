Prestone and Zerex fall into these ... why do you suggest staying away from
these formulas?

Hopefully, staying away from phosphate AND silicate containing antifreezes
will make your new pump last longer.

<< There's merit to each of the arguments you've listed.  Answer to your
 question-- It is illegal to add tinting to the driver's and passenger's door
 windows.
 
 The practical answer is that it's one of those "in the opinion of the
 officer" issues.  A car with limo-dark tint on those windows is liable to
 get a second look and maybe more. >>

I have had tints on my previous 928 and other cars and have gotten pulled over
many times for it. I only recieved a ticket once and paid it. It's illegal
here in NJ but not enforced that much. You can have the rear window tinted as
much as you want only if you have both side view mirrors.  The reason they
enforce it is because one time an officer pulled someone over with tints and
walked to the car and was shot point blank. He couldn't see the gun through
the tints. That's why you may get tickets for it. I will most likely be
tinting mine also but lighter in the fronts. If you do get pulled over roll
down both windows before the officer gets to the car.
