> Or is my battery done after two years?  
If it's a Porsche battery, probably yes.  2 years is all they are really
good for per my dealer two years after plucking down lots of $ for one.
Warranty was 1 year I found out.  He told me I could get an Audi battery
with a better warranty for about hte same $.  

After a few words with the dealer and his tip I could have used 2 years
ago,  I left and called a few Foreign car parts places.  Found an
Interstate brand battery with a 5 (maybe 7?) year warranty for less $
than the two year battey.  It's the same big size, so it fit right in,
direct replacement.  

I had first gone to Sears (ohoh), but what they tried to give me was
about 6" too short in length.  The cables wouldn't reach, much less try
to bolt it down properly.
