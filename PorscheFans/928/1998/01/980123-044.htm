Sorry, can't say.  I've never had a clutch go on me.  (Well, except
for a girl friend's 69 MGB (GT?) which had zillions of miles on
it. Since I didn't drive it all the time I can't say whether or not it
went "all of a sudden") I've racked up 100K+ miles on two other cars
with clutches and never needed to replace one.  I guess, maybe, I'm
just easy on the clutch wear for some reason.

I suspect that some memebers of the list probably have had a 928
clutch go out on them.  Hopefully they'll give you their stories...
