Shark tamers,

I have just taken apart a '79' 4.5ltr. motor and I have a few questions.

1. Did all two valve heads have wedge shaped combustion chambers?
2. Does anyone know the combustion chamber volume of the two valve head?
3. When Porsche raised the compression did they use domed pistons or reduce
the combustion chamber volume?
4. Can forged pistons be substituted for hyprereutectic pistons and safely
operate in the aluminum block?
5. What are the largest sized valves anyone has ever heard of being fitted
into a two valve head?
6. Do multiple spark control units (MSD, Jacobs) improve performance over
the Porsche CD unit? Performance coils (MSD blaster)?
7. Has anyone ever supercharged a CIS equipped 928? Did you relocate the
air meter unit, build a custom intake manifold, or blow through the air
meter unit? 
8. Do Denver shark fans have any problems with their 10 to 1 compression
ratio engines in the Mile High City?

About additives, the factory does not recommend them; I don't believe they
can bond to the engine components for more than a few hundred miles. Also,
the factory designed the engine block of low friction material making any
coating useless. The $20 spent on an additive can better be spent on a case
of synthetic oil. 

Answers, comments, and feedback appreciated.
