It is always best to buy a car which is obviously well cared  for.

No.  Provided that the car has been well maintained.  Regular oil
changes and service.
I would examine proof that the cam timing belt was replaced at around
120,000 miles.  Also, the clutch should have needed replacement at about
the same time.   If those jobs were NOT done, plan on having the timing
belt replaced immediately after purchase.  The part is only US$35-45
but there is 4-8+ hours of labor involved in replacing the belt,
inspecting water pump (replace it too if there is any bearing noise or
slop in the shaft) and adjusting belt tension (needs a US$400 tool to do
correctly).  Clutch is also somewhat expensive as the parts alone are
around US$300-400.

Not unless there are obvious problems or evidence of abuse.  The manual
trans syncronizers when worn will make 1st (and maybe 2nd) gear noisy.
If not too loud, don't worry.  But weak synchros which wear premarurely
are a known problem with the early 5-spds.  The engine should be good
for 300,000+ miles, clutch for 125,000+ miles.  Electrical problems with
accessories, and vacuum leaks in A/C or engine fuel injection system can
result in hours ($$ if you have to pay someone to do the work) spent
locating small problems.  Make sure everything works and the the engine
starts and runs well both cold and hot. Watch oil pressure and temps
during warmup and on test drive.
