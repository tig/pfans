Did the person that reinstalled the hoses reused the old o-rings?  That
would be a no-no.  If using new o-ring, did that person pre-lube it with
air-con oil prior to installation?  If not, that would be a BIG no-no.
You might want to check for leaky seals in the compressor; especially
behind the clutch area.

       i have the factory big brochure for an 89. I don't have the 87.  It
covers the 89 S4, since I don't have the 89 anymore I'll sell it to someone
for $15. Also I have the tech spec. book for 90-93 928's and a tech service 
book for an 89 GT.
