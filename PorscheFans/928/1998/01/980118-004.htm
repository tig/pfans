There are several brands of car alarms that will work well in the 928,
either in
conjunction with the OEM alarm, or as a replacement for it.  The most
important
aspect will be the actual installation itself.  Be sure that whoever does it
is
familiar with working on expensive cars, and preferrably 928s in particular.

Many shops will tell you that you can't upgrade or add to the factory alarm.
This
is not true.  You can add remote-control (commonly referred to as "keyless
entry")
to the factory system, although it will probably cost as much as installing
an
entirely new alarm.

As for the window tint, make sure it is Scotch/3M film, and look at some
samples --
preferrably on actual cars -- before you decide.  And as with the alarm (or
any other
project, for that matter) the installation is very important.  To apply the
tint properly,
the door panels may have to be partially disassembled, and the rear quarter
windows
also offer a unique challenge.

Good luck


P.S. - I highly recommend both ventures.  Being able to lock/unlock the
doors remotely
will greatly reduce the number of scratches around the key hole in the door
(look at your
car), besides being extremely convenient.  And quality window film will
reduce deterioration
of the interior due to sunlight (look at an older car).

Actually it's an '89.  The bumpers are off my 89 GT.

Hello all!
I had just purchased a blk 84' 928 with 45K miles. The car has no problem
shifting through all the gears except 2nd. It seems to me whenever i shift
into second at a higher rpm it grinds. But if i shift from 1st to second a low
speed and rpm there is no problem.
Does this sound like the beginnigs of a serious problem? Or perhaps this is
typical for the cars performance? I would appreciate it if anyone could shed a
little light on this matter.
Thanks! 
Anthony 84' 928s Staten Is, NY
