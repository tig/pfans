Ed,
Thanks again for your help!
I just spoke with the mechanic and he said that it's an intermediate plate
that you usually don't have to replace. He said that center plate is included
in the clutch kit that costing me for $500 something.

This intermediate plate is something like a flywheel, the mechanic said.
I'll go and see how much is the wear on this part at lunch break and decide
whether I pay additional $750 or not.

Anyway, thank you very much for your help!!
