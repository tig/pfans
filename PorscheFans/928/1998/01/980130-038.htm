Tom, the noise is only a problem at idle in gear or out (I have an
auto). It kind of sounds like a muffled rattling sound, coming from the
back of the motor up to the catalysts. It doesn't seem to affect the
drivability of the car, since Phil drove it this way for about a year
and the PO did also. Phil and I were going to have Lucky take a look at
it to determine the source, but I haven't got around to it. The car has
145,000 miles, so who knows, maybe it's just time to do it. Does anyone
have any statistices on torque tube life spans (they're alive, aren't
they ?.It's unfortunate that the only access to the tube is complete
removal. You can buy tubes from 928 INT for around $350-$450. I'll
probably change the timing belt and water pump before attempting the
torque tube, due to the time involved.
