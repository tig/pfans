Gary:
    I didn't replace the springs as the ride was pretty stiff for my taste. I
set the front shocks one notch softer than factory setting to try to correct
understeer. I had Devek go over it in December and they thought the shocks were
set alittle soft.  The ride height was correct, though and I think that tells
the story about springs. Unless you want to go to a stiffer or variable rate
spring, check the ride height.  Tired springs will sag.  I'll copy this to the
group and see if anybody has other ideas on this. I have no one locally to
consult on suspension problems, so perhaps others have had a different
experience.
