The oterh day I was driving my car through the mountains, and all of a
sudden it bacame very hard to turn the wheel to the left. Turning right was
no problem.

The next morning things had returned to normal.

I had the 928 mechanic check the PS during its scheduled maintenance that
day and he reported that the PS fluid level was normal and he suspected
that a valve on the sterring rack was on its way out.

Yesterday, while manoeuvring out of a petrol station, I did a hard left,
there was a loud click from the front of the car and now I have no power
assistance at all.

As I don't drive the car that frequently at present, the lack of power
assistance doesn't worry me (especially since I'm "on the market" right now
and the enlarged biceps will assist me in that area), but will this cause
damage to any part of the steering system? I imagine the forces on the
steering column UJ are far greater than normal.

Do the 928 track  racers disable the power steering (to save weight/power
loss - no PS pump, fluid or hoses)?

Finally got a picture of my 928 up on the web. Unfortunately the batteries
in the digital camera were low and the contrast was screwed up. Take a look
at http://navigator.co.nz/andy/andy1.jpg if you're interested.

Cheers,
