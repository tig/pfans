Okay, this is interesting.  I've definitely had cars run without a battery when,
in the case of a dead battery and no jumper leads I have put the battery out
of another car in, started the car, and while it's running swapped the dead
battery back in so that it will get charged.  (And please, no-one get excited
about the damage I could have done swapping the battery with the engine
running - I know that now!)

The point is, both times I've done this the car didn't die.  I'd have to check
whether the Lotus Seven I did it on had a generator or an alternator, but
the Esprit and the Triumph were both definitely alternators.

So... why?  (I agree with Vince - it shouldn't work in theory.)

Eventually the weak battery will be charged by the alternator to a point
where it will sustain the operation of the vehicle.  The big assumption
is that the condition of the battery is good to begin with and that you
run the vehicle at least 2,000 rpm (which is actually 4,000 rpm at the
alternator's pulley...) without any accessory load for an extended
period of time.  A battery in good condition should be able to retain a
charge relatively fast.  I always put the battery on a charger at the
first opportunity whenever I left a drain on by accident.  If you have a
questionable battery and if you just booster-jump enough to start the
car and drive off, you will not get very far.  

An alternator does not have permanent magnets like a generator.  The
magnetic field is created via a coil winding being energized by the
battery.  If you have a weak battery, the magnetic field created will be
weak; hence a low charging rate.  (I'm assuming that you're able to
start the car to begin with, which I doubt...).  I've never seen a car
run without a battery before.  Unless it is equipped with a generator
instead of an alternator.  Generators became obsolete back in the mid
60s.
