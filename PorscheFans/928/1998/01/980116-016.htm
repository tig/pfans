Dan,

Tell the dealer to put a hot start circuit in your car.  My '86 S/Euro
was having the same problem.  A local Porsche mechanic friend and I
installed a little Bosch relay with three wires and an integral fuse.
This circuit shunts battery power directly to the starter when needed.
My car has been starting fine ever since.  The part is about $10.
Larry, the Porsche guy, says that most German alternators have the same
problem after a few years.  Their become a little weak and it takes more
to get them started.  Well, I'm a believer.  My car has been starting
fine ever since the small mod we made.

Good luck!

Firstly a problem recap for new list members:

My 91 S4 occasionally just won't start at all.  The immobiliser seems to
turn off okay, all the ignition lights come on, but turning the key has 
absolutely no effect - the dash lights don't even dim.  Leaving the car 
for 15 minutes or so seems to work - eventually it starts no problem, 
but this is becoming really infuriating and I'm dreading the time it 
happens on a petrol station forecourt in front of queue of impatient 
Porsche enviers.  Has anyone ever pushed a 928 single-handed?

Well, the car's at the dealers (AFN) today and I've just got off the 
phone to them.  They can't replicate the problem and they've said they 
can't find anything wrong.  The service manager said:

"Maybe one of the numerous electronic brains is malfunctioning 
somewhere, you'll have a job tracing it if it is and replacement will be
big money..."
