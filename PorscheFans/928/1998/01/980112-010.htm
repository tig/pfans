Howdy All,

I have a 1986S with Bilstiens all the way around.  Now... when ever I =
tell an informed Porsche enthusiast that, they are impressed, but all I =
can really tell is that they seem to cost about 5 times much as Koni or =
other options.  I can't tell if people are impressed because these are =
great shocks or if they know the pain of paying so much for them.  What =
is so great about these bilstien shocks and why do they cost so much?  =
The best price that I found for the replacement of my rears was ~$400 =
and now it is time to do the fronts and I am having a hard time even =
locating them and they are even more expensive when I have found them.  =
I know that they are adjustable, but aren't other strut combos on 928s =
adjustable as well?  Also, is there a special tool out there that makes =
turning the spring tension plate easier?

Thanks!!!
