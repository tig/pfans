Yes, and they're also the same as the S4 fronts: 7J x 16, 65 mm offset.

bolts? 

The S4 rears are 8J x 16, 52.3 mm offset; this means that the center of the
rim is 12.7 mm (half an inch) further outboard than that of the fronts. In
addition, the rims are an inch wider, so the outer edge winds up a full
inch further outboard than that of the 7" wheels. Look at your car's rear
wheels now and see if you've got clearance under the fender for the outside
of the wheel and tire to come out another inch. You won't want to use any
spacer; these will just push the outside surface further outboard.

Meanwhile, the bolt circle is the same. However, lug nuts get tired over
time. This would be a good time to get a new set for all four wheels.
