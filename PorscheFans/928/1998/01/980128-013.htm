Have you ever seen Paul? or his reputation?  :)
(no offense to you, Paul -- just trying to make a point)

This is actually standard policy with hotels (I think it has been for a few
years now).
There are a couple of reasons for it.  First -- if the room is "trashed",
they know
who to come looking for.  Second -- the government is able to document or
track your
whereabouts.  It is no secret that the government would like to do away with
cash
transactions altogether :)
