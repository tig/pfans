It's not completely obvious why this is correct.  Since 99.9% of all
wheels are balanced off the car, if the wheel is balanced why does it
matter which way it goes on?  The lock will always add an imbalance
irrespective of the orientation of the balanced wheel.

The reason must be that the valve stem flexes at high speed creating an
imbalance.  If the lock and the stem are basically on the same side of
the wheel, the 2 small effects will add together.  John White pointed
out the valve stem flexing to me in the first minutes after I met him at
Lime Rock.  (Of course, we had to talk because the organizers had
assigned us both the same car #.  Those air-cooled drivers!  They must
think we're all alike.)  At 100 mph, the valve stem is pulling about 400
g's so you can bet it's splatted flat against the rim.  You can mount
the tires the recomended way and use short valve stems.  I agree with
Leonard on replacing those lug nuts - for the track, replace them with
steel nuts ($40 for the set at 928Int).

(Next time you have your wheels balanced, ask them to tape the valve
stems to the wheels when they balance them.  See what kind of reaction
you get!  Of course, then you'd want to mount the wheels with the locks
on the opposite side.)
