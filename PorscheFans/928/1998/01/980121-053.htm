Hi all!

Marc Reviel's post regarding his DynoJet runs has prompted me to
announce something a little earlier than planned, but here goes:

DEVEK will be adding a new area to our web site, called the "DEVEK
Performance Team Dyno Room".  This area will be open to EVERYONE who has
had their 928 across a DynoJet, stock or modified.  There is no charge
for this service.

Here are the "rules":
1.  Take your car to your nearest DynoJet facility. To find the one
nearest you, visit http://www.dynojet.com , use the dyno locator map and
call your nearest DynoJet for an appointment! It's easy. Results from
other chassis dynamometers will not be accepted.
2. 
Get a printout of your dyno session (preferably an original), along with
date & time of session. The dyno chart must be an original dyno sheet as
measured on the DynoJet. Please make sure the dyno operator has listed
on the submitted printout the shop where the run was performed along
with the listed HP, Torque and Correction Factor as output by the
DynoJet software. "Artistic renderings" of dyno results will not be
accepted. Please have output indicated in RPM instead of MPH.
3. 
Include the details about your car. At a minimum, we need to know the
following: model year, origin (US/Euro), transmission, and modifications
(if any). Feel free to include as much detail about your 928 as you
wish...the more the better!  Be sure to include your contact name, phone
number and e-mail address in case we need to contact you with questions.
4. 
You may also include a photograph of your 928, either on the dyno or in
another setting. We will include this on your page!
5. 
Mail the above three items (dyno sheet, write up & photo) to DEVEK
Performance, 248 Harbor Blvd, Belmont CA 94002. If you are not including
a photograph, you may fax the information to 650-610-0557, or e-mail
scanned files to dyno@devek.net.

Any information received prior to Jan 31, 1998 will go up on the first
version of the site.  After that, the Dyno Room will be updated
periodically as I receive entries.  I'll post an announcement when the
Dyno Room goes "live".

Looking forward to seeing all of your results!  Let me know if you have
any questions.
