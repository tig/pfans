I put a Kenwood in my Citro=EBn SM (spare me your pity...I sold it to =
buy
the shark),
based partially on recommendations from stereo nerds that Kenwood had
the=20
best FM tuner around.  I was very happy with the stereo (occasionally
also happy
with the SM).

I put an Alpine in the shark, as my roommate works at a car stereo
store, and=20
got me a cost + 10%, and the Alpine was the best thing they had, and am =

pretty happy with that too...maybe the Kenwood had a better tuner--hard
to tell.
