That's very interesting Brian.  I have never had any problems with it
smearing or streaking (on several different vehicles and know of several
friends who also use it religiously), nor any more problems applying it
than I would with any wax.  I always do this right after washing my car and
cleaning the windows well, and no problems whatsoever.  I've had my first
bottle of the stuff (less than $5, but who's counting) for almost 1.5 years
now without any problems and I'll get one more use out of it yet before
having to buy another bottle.   I wonder if it has to do with anything
specific put on your windshields that you have tried it on before the
application of the Rain-X?
