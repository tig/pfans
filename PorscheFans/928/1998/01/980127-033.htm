Well, I don't have any on an 87, but I do have some stuff from 1993 that
covers generally all models of Porsches.  They are the I guess, general
brochure from 1993 and have 2 pages for the 968, 911, 928 GTS, and the 911
Turbo.  Plus they have a 3 page foldout in the back that gives the tech
specs for all of the cars there.

Anyone who wants one that can spare mail costs (probably $1.50 for postage
and envelope, but not totally sure), I'll be glad to send them one.  I'm in
the process of finding another job and am without any job at the moment, so
my money is VERY tight.   I was given about 40 or so of these back in 93
for a school project.  My address is need4speed@prodigy.com for those who
might be interested.

Andrew
