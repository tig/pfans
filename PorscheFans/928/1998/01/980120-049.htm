This is realy interesting

In Performance Portfolio page 106 is the sunroof listed as extra =A31341.=
76.

I have three (3) options on my car: radio, sport shocks and sunroof none=20
of the other ecuipment is listed on the paper in rear.

Is all ecuipment listed on your cars or is it only the extras? I have the
leather dash, I don't think it's standard on every car (or?), but this is=
 not
listed.

Patrick, I spoke to David and he has tried to email you but can't because of
some server problem. If you need any parts or anything from him email me and
I'll foward it to you or you can call him. I think that he has black door
panels for an early model 928, your 79. Are you interested in them?
