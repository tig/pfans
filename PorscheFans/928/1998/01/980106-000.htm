Hmm, this is getting more curious.  In haste I changed the engine
numbers on my page but may have been premature but more on that later.  

The following engine numbers are from 'The Porsche Family Tree' as
published by the PCA:
1990 928 S4     85L50501-01449 (AT) <--- spec book has 81L0...
1990 928 GT     81L00501-02591      <--- spec book has 85L0...

My Factory Cardex came back as:
1990 engine 85L00855

Mike and John, I'm gonna say congratulations on catching this and am
forwarding this to the PCA to correct their Family Tree booklet!  (Chuck
Zachman if you're reading this feel free to take the ball!) 

The Family Tree info for MY 1989 is cloudy as well as no numbers are
posted at all for GTs:
1989 928 S4     81K00051-00629
                85K05051-07642 (AT)

Does anyone have the factory spec booklet for MY 1989 to confirm/verify
these numbers?
Owners of '89 - '91s can you post your numbers to help clarify? 

Additionally I will try to follow-up with PCNA as to why GTs are being
reported as S4 on the cardex.  (aside: I've read in other books the S4
nomenclature was dropped entirely in MY 1990 so the choices were either
928 or GT!)

For sure all '90s came with that nifty PSD system.

So how do you like that, the 928 is still creating controversy, in new
ways even!

Thanks for your eagle eyes,
Phil Tong
