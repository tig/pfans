When I was in Ft. Lauderdale in November, a dealership there had a '87
928S4 that they claimed belonged to Larry Holms. I was told that he bought
it new, and then spent an additional $80,000 on it. The owner of the
dealership claimed that $13,000 of that was for the paint job alone. It was
a Candy Apple Red custom wide body, with custom white leather interior. I
don't know about any performance modifications that were supposed to have
been done on it.
