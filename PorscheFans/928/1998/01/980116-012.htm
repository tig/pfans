I do not dispute the supremacy of synthetics.  However, a guy here in
Atlanta has over 400,000 miles on his 16 valver with only regularly
sheduled maintainance.  I saw in the 1989 928 factory brochure the
Porsche factory telling the salesman we'll be impressed when your
300,000 mile car has 600,000 miles on it, etc.  I doubt either of these
guys use synthetics.  The point is, engines being a 928 strong point,
isn't regular Valvoline or Castol sufficient, especially when so many
peripherals (electronics, clutch, list goes on) aren't as durable (I'm
car poor if you can't tell)

Second, I noticed all the shock talk and wanted to point out I just paid
$240 for the same Boge the car came with.  I'm sure thousand dollar
Bilsteins would outperform them, but the car as it came outperforms
everything else and cost effective is my goal, as the 928 is a lot of
car to keep up with (as if you all weren't aware)

The list kicks ass, I look forward to reading it daily!
