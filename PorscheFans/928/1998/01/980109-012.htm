	Let me tell you boys a little story about alternators, which should clear
up all of these questions about whether a car can run without a battery.
	A few years back, my father owned an '88 928S4 and an '88 911 Turbo
Cabriolet. The turbo was gorgeous, and had a super aftermarket stereo in it
with a huge amp under the seat. The S4 hadn't run for a few months, and
didn't have a battery in it. The S4's battery had died earlier, and dad
threw it away, planning on buying another. One day, he wants to switch
cars, but only has one battery, currently in the turbo. So he says Adam,
drive home, park the turbo but leave it running, and take the battery out
of it. Then put the battery in the 928, back it out of the garage, then put
it back in the turbo. Park the turbo in the garage, then shut it off and
put the battery in the 928, and drive it here. I told him I didn't think
the cars would run without a battery, but he assured me they would.
No Problem, whatever you say, pop. I drove the turbo home from dad's work,
and parked it in the driveway. I leave it running, and get out of the car,
and open the 928's hatch, getting it ready for the new battery. I walked
back to the turbo, popped the hood, and took out the battery. The car still
ran. I thought dad must have been right. I turned back, and started
installing the battery in the 928, fumbling with it in that tight space. I
got the thing hooked up, and thought to try the ignition. As I took my head
out of the hatch, I glanced at the turbo, and nearly fainted as a cloud of
white smoke came out of the cockpit and hood. 
	Suffice to say, his Alpine V-12 amp was baked, and wasn't even on at the
time; the left side of the car bore not one functional light of any sort;
all of this, and the bill from Norden Autohaus was over $1500.00 CDN

Don't take dad's advice: Leave the battery in a running car. I suspect a
911 is no different than a 928. 

Tune in tomorrow for another bed time story.
