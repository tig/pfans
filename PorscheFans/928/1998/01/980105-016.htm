I posted this question about a month ago.  I got several responses, all of
which were people informing me that I don't have a four speed automatic
transmission in this model car.  (trust me people, I do. . .and Ferdinand's
boys put it there)  Anybody got good advice for me on the following?

I have a 1983 928s with the four speed Mercedes automatic transmission.


I have some vibration in all gears (even neutral) between 1500 and 2500 RPM.
I wouldn't call it "major", but it has gradually gotten my attention.

Also, I have a minor drip-leak in the transmission area.

Could these be related?  Could the first problem be the torque tube?  Could
the leak be these Teflon seals earlier discussed?  Is the repair kit
installable without a full "rebuild"?

I would appreciate ANY AND ALL responses - even wild, uneducated guesses.
If you don't want to publish to the list just mail me directly at
steve@viperlink.net .

Thanks in advance.
-Steve
