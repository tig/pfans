Howdy!!!

Just replaced mine.  Get a ZF rebuilt rack.  You'll thank yourself when =
you don't have to do the job again in a year.

It is really not that hard of a job, but if you have any engine oil =
leakage or your rack had a bad leak, I would go to your local power-wash =
shop and blast the undercarriage of the car, what a mess!!!  The hardest =
part of the job is removing the tie-rods.  You better have a big 22 =
wrench to do that.  I had to go down to my friends Porsche Service shop =
and use his tools to get one off.  Don't know what your budget is, but =
you might want to consider having a mechanic do it.  With the right =
tools and a lift would make it only a 3hr job, not to mention that you =
are going to need an alignment before it is all said and done.  Might =
actually be more with an 87, you have an airbag and you really have to =
remove the steering wheel to get everything straight again, but I am not =
sure what that takes, extremely easy with my car! =20

Good Luck!!!
