I'd like t say hi to you all, and that I'm really enjoying reading the
listings even though they are a little long winded at times.  I really
enjoy my car, which I've had for three years now, and I thought that I was
into it a lot, but I must say that some of you are nuts about your cars.
Its great though.  Mine is a 1982 Weinrot Metallic, with a new black
interior conversion (from brown) that I just completed.  Its automatic,
with 115k miles.
	Here are a few problems for which I would appreciate any input:
1)  The cruise control engages but does it hold.  It immediately
decelerates when I let go of the switch.
2) The fog lights are not coming on all the time, and I've changed the
relay.  I now get the same intermittent functioning with both the old and
new relays.
3) I'm about to replace the high pressure cooling hoses for the
tramsmission as well the filter and the fluid.  Any do's and dont's?

I also have a few recommendations regarding things I've done.  Someone was
asking about speakers.  I highly recommend Infinity as the sound clarity
and quality are unmatched, when the bass is augmented.  The highs are
unbelievable.  I've got  Infinity 6.5in 3-ways in the rear kick panels and
4in mids in the doors, a 6in Bazooka tube for bass, all powered by a
200watt JBL amp and an Alpine cd player.  The amp is actually too big, so
I've had to sneak it into the passenger footwell behind the driver's seat,
and I've just set the bass tube on the front passenger side footwell with
the speaker forward.  I've found that this actually gives the best sound as
it reflects the bass from the firewall to the back and through the center
to the driver's side.  The only problem is its just sitting there, but my
girlfriend does not think its in the way, as she is the passenger that's
normally there.
	I've also figured out how to wire keyless entry with a capable
alarm system into Porsche's factory locks.  It was not any easy job to
figure out, but is very easy to wire in, you just need two relays. If
anyone is interested, send a message, or maybe I'll just detail it with my
next posting.
