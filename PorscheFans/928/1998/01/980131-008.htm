 Hell,  I'm still learning all the wonderful characteristics of this
awesome piece of machinery and am concerned about passing on improper
information.

Alex, don't be afraid of posting "improper" information.  It looks like
we all have different
experience with our car and you might have seen something that no one
ever seen
before.  Just do like I do: "I think it might be ....  Does anyone else
agree with this?"

It often get people thinking on the subject.  And if you are wrong, god
knows I am often,
people are friendly enough to know you did not try to do harm but to
transmit information.
At the same time, you get corrected on a piece of information that was
not right and you
get to improve your knowledge of the car.

Of course, I would not talk about taking off a transmission when I never
attempted it or
even read about it on the service manual.

But get involve, the worse that will happen is that you will start a
thread with a lot of
good humor...
