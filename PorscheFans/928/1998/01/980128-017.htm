Following is a procedure I used to remove the door panels in my '83.  

NOTE:  I have the door speakers that are INSIDE the door panel, under 
the perforated leather.  If you have the type that have the speaker 
grills ON the door, I think these are removed by unscrewing them.(?)

First, before you get started, it's probably a good idea to disconnect 
your battery since you will be disconnecting a few electrical 
connections.

1.  Remove the screw under the door opening lever.
2.  Remove the plastic trim piece under the lever.
3.  Unsnap the top two snaps on the center panel and slide it up and 
out.
4.  Remove five bolts (two inside armrest pocket w/plastic caps, two 
above grip, and one above pocket, w/plastic cap on it).
5.  Coin holder in driver's door just pops out.
6.  Pop out plastic circular air inlet and remove bolt from inside 
there (it's a long one).
7.  Carefully pry out middle flat part of door locking knob (it just 
snaps in), remove screw inside, and then the knob itself.  The 
Circular trim piece then UNSCREWS.  DO NOT try to just pull it 
straight off!
8.  Pop mirror control up and out of armrest and remove connectors.  
Write down position of wires before removing.  (driver's door).
9.  Lift armrest up and off.
10.  Remove one screw in door panel at back of armrest area.
11.  Remove two screws in black plastic trim piece in door hinge area, 
and slide trim piece back over electrical conduit.
12.  Pop out lower door light, write down position of wires, and 
remove wires.
13.  Locate and remove the two screws in the bottom of the door panel, 
under the pocket area.
14.  Pop off THIRTEEN plastic snaps rivets (three along the top, above 
the open area, three along the front hinge edge, two along the back 
latch edge, and five along the bottom.  Do this carefully, so you 
don't damage the fiberboard door panel.  A flat, forked tool works 
well for this, or maybe two putty knives, one on each side of the 
snap.
15.  Pull door panel out and up and slide toward the front of the car.  
There's a clip near the door locking knob that you have to clear.
16. Remove wires from speaker, noting their positions.

That's it!
