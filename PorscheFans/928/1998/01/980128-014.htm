> Hey Stiphane,

> No the car is sold as model '87 but year of manufacture '86.
> It's quite common here in Europe to sell a late '89 car for instance as
> model '90 so it's a bit of a trick for the dealers, if you are not aware
or
> dont read the small print you can be taken, '87 looks better than '86
when
> you're selling. I presume its the same in Canada and the U.S. 
> Although I seem to remember reading somewhere that the models are
released
> in Europe first and a bit later your side of the water.
> 
> The Porsche model or Chassis No. specify the "model year" only as far I
> know so one has to be aware that this runs from October to October.  So
> probably 25-30% of that model will have been produced the year before,
not
> that it makes any REAL difference.
> Some manufacturers will sell previous years spec. cars for knock down
> prices. I guess the last four digits of the I.D. No. should be the best
> indicator as we know the aproximate numbers produced in any one year.
> So git chiken to satisfy your curiosity.
