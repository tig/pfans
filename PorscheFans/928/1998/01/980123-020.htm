Subject: headache


Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was
increasingly hampered by incredible headaches.  When his personal
hygiene and
love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being
referred from
one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved
the
problem.
"The good news is I can cure your headaches... The bad news is that it
will
require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your
testicles
to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one
hell of a
headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the
testicles."
Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he has anything to live
for.  He
couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice
but to
go under the knife.
When he left the hospital, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was
missing
an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he  realized
that
he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live
a new
life.
He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, "That's what I need:
a new
suit." He entered the shop and told the salesman, "I'd like a new
suit."  The
salesman eyed him briefly and said, "Let's see... size 44 long."
Joe laughed, "That's right, how did you know?"
"It's my job."
Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the
mirror,
the salesman asked, "How about a new shirt?"
Joe thought for a moment and then said, "Sure..."
The salesman eyed Joe and said, "Let's see... 34 sleeve and... 16 and a
half
neck"
Joe was surprised, "That's right, how did you know?"
"It's my job."
Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Joe adjusted the
collar in
the mirror, the salesman asked, "How about new shoes?"
Joe was on a roll and said, "Sure ..."
The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, "Let's see... 9-1/2... E."
Joe was astonished, "That's right, how did you know?"
"It's my job."
Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly. Joe walked comfortably
around
the shop and the salesman asked, "How about a new hat?"
Without hesitating, Joe said, "Sure..."
The salesman eyed Joe's head and said, "Let's see... 7-5/8."
Joe was incredulous, "That's right, how did you know?"
"It's my job."
The hat fit perfectly. Joe was feeling great, when the salesman asked,
"How about some new underwear?"
Joe thought for a second and said, "Sure..."
The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, "Let's see...
size
36."
Joe laughed with a “Gotcha!  I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years
old."
The salesman shook his head, "You can't wear a size 34. It would press
your
testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a
headache."
