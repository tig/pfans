Further followup on a couple of threads.

911 Turbo
The February issue of European Car is on the 35 years of the 911. In
discussing the small number of Turbos produced, they quoted 519 imported to US
of 1,201 produced in 1976 and in '77 716 of 1,772.

They also discussed the styling of the 1996 Turbo Carrera "The body lines were
a little sweeter, rounded at the rear in an almost 928 theme".

New 996
Also in discussing the styling of the neww 996 911 they state "The rear lamps
have a look reminiscent of the 928". 
They also note a concern that the new 996 is larger and "heading the way of a
928, a car more GT than sports car".
Also in discussing the rear suspension "awesome interpretation of the passive
rear-steer technology pioneered with 928's so-called Weissach axle".
So the new 996 is larger, water cooled, with the Weissach axle and reminiscent
of the 928, but still rear engined with the ignition on the left so as not to
confuse the 911 drivers.

Also for the person looking for a GTS, in Autoweek a dealer Isringhausen
(217-528-2277) in Springfield, Illinois lists a '94 928 GTS
Blk/Blk,auto,CD,phone with 25k miles, no price listed.

Also, although I was following the thread on car care products with interest,
on a sunny day between storms (OK so it's only a little rain) in the San Diego
area, I had washed and decided to wax my recently acquired red '87 . I pulled
out my can of Wynn's Classic Slipstream High Performance Wax (Classic Wax to
me until I read the whole label) and started in. Half way through I noticed
that on the cover and on the sides is a red early 928 with phone dial wheels!
I had used that can several times previously with no notice of the red shark.
Anyone else noted products featuring the 928?
