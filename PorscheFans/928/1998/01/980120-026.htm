	Why? Just time, or are you having some fuel flow problems?

	I'll leave that to others, but would politely suggest you invest
in shop
	manuals (Mr. Goring of this list is trying to unload his set).

	>could someone tell me were the fuel filter is located
(87.928.S4).

	Under the gas tank (under the car, behind the right rear wheel),
behind a
	protective cover, are the fuel pump and filter. Make sure you
get the
	connections back together in a leakproof way, and don't start up
	(electricity, with spark potential, at the fuel pump with
ignition on)
	until whatever fuel leaked out has evaporated.

....I would remove the fuel pump fuse, start the car and let it run until
it dies before I disconnect the fuel filter.  You won't have about a
gallon of fuel squirting all over the place...
