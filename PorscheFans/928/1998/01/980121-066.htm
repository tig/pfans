Ever hear of "Urban Folklore?"

The message included below is "Cyber Folklore."  This is not the fault of
the people who send it.  It is out of their concern and sense of community
that they chose to share this information- a sense of community that is
becoming more and more scarce.  I hope this spirit never leaves the
internet.  Unfortunately, they are the victims of a hoax.

Read about this, the "good times virus" and others at:
