Hi All,
         I just bought a Nakamichi CD player model CD-45 and it is
roughly the same price as the Blaupunkt Toronto (the Nakamichi was reg
999.00 and was on sale for 799.00 and the Blaupunkt was reg. 999.00 on
sale for 899.00). The sales guy said that they were both excellent decks
but the Nakamichi had a "way" better reputation as far as build quality
and the Nakamichi also had the capability of adding a extra piece
(299.00) that would make the deck a 20bit rather than the 1 bit of both
the stock Nackamichi and the Blaupunkt. The install is Tomorrow so I
will test it and pass along the results and the above price's are in
Canadian Dollars.

Thanks,
J.Brown (the J is for James as in James Brown the Godfather of soul, so
if anyone want's a celebrity *owned* 928 make me an offer)
.
