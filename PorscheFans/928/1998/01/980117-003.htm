Well I am getting down to the nitty gritty and almost have a completely
done car.. I have been driving it all along but not _really_ legally. And
its nice to have stuff like two seats and carpet and stuff...

Interesting encounter.. I have been having trouble with my lights, (This is
a 78') My headlights would go on, and come up properly, but my taillights
wouldnt work. Brake lights fine, reverse lights fine, but no taillights.
(Intermittent) I traced the problem to the fog light switch.. (Why are they
connected like that?) It was actually loose... Simple enough to fix (I
pulled the switch off, did the half rotation on the inner part and pulled
the assembly right out of the hole in the dash. Then I was able to push the
switch back together and everything is beautiful.

The other problem I had was that half my pod guages had no/partial
readings. I had noticed that if i had a full tank of gas it would show half
a tank, and below half it would just peg out on the left by the empty
mark.. Other gauges seemed to work ok except the temp gauge, which worked
intermittently, when it did work, however, it worked properly. The problem
turned out to be the connector where the wiring harness connects to the
ribbon style connector coming off the gauge assembly. I cleaned the ribbon
traces with kerosene and a long cotton swab.. and I used a pinpoint round
file to clean the nibs inside the 'bus' plastic connector coming off of the
wiring harness. I then used a dental pick to get under each nib of metal in
the plug and pry them back out to a snug position.. (20 years of settling..
it will probably have to be replaced in another 20) It took a lot of care
to make sure they were still aligned properly. All the gauges work properly
now.

2 Questions:

Has anyone here attached a strosek Wing? How is it done? My Body guys put
in on and initially it looked secure but I dont like the way they did it..
(Screws at an inward angle, with the heads of the screws where the hatch
meets the rubber weatherstripping)

In an open road race, would 100+ Octane Trick do a better job than 92
octane premium or even 90 mid grade for that matter? This is a completely
stock vehicle. (California Car)
