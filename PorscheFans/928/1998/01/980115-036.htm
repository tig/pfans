Topic - no topic tonight, just chat and suggestions

And from now on, every Wednesday at 8pm.
______________________________________________

I've directed this email to the 928 list and to as few people who are active and
enthusiastic (and, sometimes, humourous) on that list directly.  This is so
that those of you who are in digest mode still get this email in time for this
afternoon.

We tried out the chat channel that was being promoted yesterday evening and
found that the performance and interface were slow and difficult to use, so
we've initiated some chat sessions for 928 owners on an IRC server.  Anyone
who doesn't know about IRC but would like to join in please email me and I
will give you some pointers on how to get connected.  It works over your
normal internet connection, the software is free, so it's really not that complicated.

Regular time will be Wednesday evening 8pm - midnight EST (it'll go later if people
have the energy.)  But there'll be one tonight, Thursday, from 8pm.  Thanks to Andy
Gardner for getting this set up for us.

See you there!  (Phil Tong - do you want to promote this on your site?)
