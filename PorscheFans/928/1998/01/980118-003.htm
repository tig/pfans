My wife and I decided to go furniture shopping in a rather upscale
neighborhood to get some ideas for future redecorating. It's nice out so we
hop in the 928. We pull into the parking lot and the only other car is a
newer black 911 Carrera (whale tail and all). Thinking that P cars should
stick together, I pull into the spot next to him.

We go into the store and are looking around and I see a guy in his 50s
wearing jeans and a leather jacket heading for the door, I think to myself,
he's probably the 911 owner. I watch him as he gets closer to the door and
he sees our cars and he starts to smile. He stops at the door and turns to
us (the only other people around) and asks if it's our car. I say yes and he
comes back in and says he has a funny story about a 928.

"When my son moved out to Hollywood and started making movies he was driving
an older Mazda. He was becoming successful and people kept telling him he
should be driving a nicer car, and a few people told him about the 928. That
put the bug in him and one day he was driving along and sees a sign for a
Porsche dealer. He pulls in and asks the salesman about the 928. the sales
guy tells him 'Go get your Dad and come back, and we'll see' So he tells the
guy he has the money ($68,000 at the time) go ahead and call his bank, etc.
The sales guy keeps telling him 'No, go get your Dad' So he leaves, a bit
upset. Driving back he sees another Porsche dealer and pulls in. Goes
through the same routine, except this dealership says, 'OK, when do you want
it?' He tells them right now and they comply. He drives the 928 back to the
first dealer and lets them know that he really didn't need his Dad to buy
the car"

He tells us the story (much better than I just did) and says maybe you have
heard of his son, his name is Rob Lowe. We say yes, blah, blah, blah. We
continue to chit-chat for about 20 minutes about furniture, Porsches (he
really liked driving the 928, but likes the look of the 911 better) and his
sons. Nice guy.

My wife now has me scheduled to take her to every upscale store in a 100
mile radius in the 928 so "We can meet people"  At least I can justify the
extra gas money now :)
