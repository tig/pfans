Seeing as there was no real damage done to your car, you should probably =
let the mechanic live.  Don't have gas stations change your oil again.  =
Take it to whoever works on the car when you need repairs.  It may cost =
you a few dollars more but you won't have to worry about the car =
disassembling  itself two miles down the road after the "mechanic" has =
wrought his magic on your car.
