	Keep in mind that the alternator relies on a good battery to do
its job.  Alot of people gets the misconception that the alternator will
be able to charge a low battery with no problem.  Unlike a generator, an
alternator uses the battery to create the magnetic field strong enough
to sustain voltage generation.  I would check the condition of the
battery first before anything else.

	For the last few days, I've been driving around with a digital
	voltmeter plugged into the cigarette lighter, and it looks like
the
	dashboard meter is reading on average about 0.6V too low.  Also,
the
	dashboard guage seems a bit inconsistent; maybe a bad connection
or
	some mechanical sticking.  But the voltage I'm measuring is
still too
	low for comfort.  With the engine running and no accessories on,
it
	goes as high as 13.6V, but with the lights, wipers and rear
defogger
	on high, it sometimes falls to as low as 12V, which won't do
much
	charging.

	thanks for the help,
