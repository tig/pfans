That's the most important consideration. Automotive electronics is designed
to be pretty bulletproof, allowing for voltages swinging between (say) 8
and 20 volts. But remove the battery from the circuit and you are asking
for trouble. Not only does the battery provide power to start the car and
help run things whenever the alternator isn't producing useable output, its
second function is as a large capacitor (ie "damper"). Without it voltage
and current fluctuations can easily get way out-of-hand, damaging sensitive
electronics and also the voltage regulator.

This is an important consideration when jump starting a car whose battery
is so flat that you need to remove it from the circuit to get the car to
start. In this situation, you should disconnect the _earth_ lead to that
battery and then connect the jumper leads to the battery cables. Removing
the earth lead takes the battery out of circuit. Once the car has started,
you re-connect the earth lead, _then_ take off the jumper cables.

Disconnecting the earth lead instead of the hot lead is far safer as when
you're tightening the terminal with a spanner, the chances of shorting out
to ground are zero. I learnt this the hard way, tightening up the positive
battery terminal in my Mini. The spanner contacted with the chassis and
spot-welded itself in place. Luckily I managed to break the weld _before_
the battery exploded in my face.
