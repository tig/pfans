I found the problem of my 90 S4 runnig rich.  There was two problems.

1.  There was a vaccum leak affecting the fuel pressure regulators/dampners.
2.  The Air temp sensor was barely outside tolerances...

Both issues have been resolved and the car is running great.  there are four
or five vaccum lines with rubber fittings under the intake.  My car is 7
years old, and I had just recently replaced the PCV hoses and several other
hoses under the intake.  The little rubber elbows, that connect the lines to
varoius connections felt flexible, at the time so I ignored them.  So, the
moral of the story is that if you ever remove the intake, replace every
rubber component located under it, because heat gets trapped between the air
dome and the intake, causing the rubber components to age prematurely.

<< 
 HI GUYS,
 BEING ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT OF 928 PORSCHES (DROVE MY FIRST YESTERDAY), PERHAPS
 SOMEONE CAN SHARE ,WHAT SEEMS TO BE, YOUR CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE ON THIS CAR.
 1 - WHY IS THIS CAR RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE ? 911 'S OF THE SAME YEAR COST
 TWICE WHAT A 928 DOES.
 2 - ANY COMMON PROBLEMS TO BE AWARE OF ?
 3 - THE CAR I DROVE WAS AN '86, AUTO, DUAL AIR WITH 65,000 MILES ON IT AND
 LOOKED LIKE IT JUST CAME OUT OF A SHOWROOM, FOR $12,000. IS THAT REASONABLE ?
 4 - WHILE I DIDN'T NAIL IT FROM A DEAD STOP THE ACCELERATION DIDN'T IMPRESS
 ME. I ONLY WENT TO 40MPH OR SO BEFORE TRAFFIC, BUT IT SEEMED KIND OF SOFT. AM
 I EXPECTING TOO MUCH ?
 5 - FINALLY, CAN YOU GUIDE ME TO A KNOWLEDGEABLE MECHANIC WHO CAN CHECK THE
 CAR OUT FOR ME IN ORANGE COUNTY,CA ?
 MANY THANKS FOR ANY HELP. DAN
