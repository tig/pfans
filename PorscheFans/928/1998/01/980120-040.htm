	Does anyone know what the laws are in California for window
tinting?  I am
	thinking of tinting the windows and like the look of tinting all
but the
	windshield, but have been told that tinting the driver and
passenger windows
	is illegal.  Some say it is, some say it is not, some say it
depends on how
	dark the tint is and some say it depends on the cop.  Any
insight would be
	appreciated.

In California, it is illegal to tint the front windows; driver and
passenger.  Majority of the people (I included) uses 10-20% tint in the
front and able to get away with it.  In reality, yes, it depends on the
darkness of the tint and always, it depends on the cop.  I got stopped
on I-5 one day driving 63 in a 55 mph zone.  The CHP asked me if my
front windows tinted.  I said "Yes".  He said that there is a law
against tinting the front, etc. etc.  And I responded by saying that I
spend about 4 hours on the road daily and that my dermatologist said
that I need to protect my face while day-driving.  (pointing to my
freckles on the side of my face..)  He let me go with a warning.  No
citation on the window tinting.
