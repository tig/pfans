This is a stupid neophyte question, but here goes.  My '89 S4 has the
stock disc wheels with the key operated wheel locks.  I recently had to
change a rear tire and read the somewhat confusing section in the
manual.  As I recall, it stated that the wheel lock should go on the red
marked lug bolt and that is should be placed next to the valve stem. 
However, the manual has a note that says on 17" wheels it should be
opposite the valve stem.  Is that only for "cup" style wheels and not for
the 17" flat  rear discs?  Bottom line, should the lock be opposite or next
to the valve stem on the rear wheels of an S4.  Also, does any of this
make any real difference?  Thanks!

The oil pressure on my 928 S2 AUTO. (1986) suddenly went to zero. After this
happened I drove the car home for about 3 miles (5km) with the tappets
sounding noisey so I obviously didn't have any oil pressure even though it
still seemed to drive fine. I assume I have damged the crankshaft or is the
problem something more simple? 
I have sourced a good second hand engine as the cost of looking for the fault
would be to much but it's for a manual car would this fit my auto car ?
