New kid here....  Actually I have been a fan of the 928 for several   
years, but I never thought I could
afford one.
   

I have noticed rather recently that the prices of used 928's have become   
quite accessible, and I
am now considering, very seriously, purchasing one.
   

I am seeing prices, sometimes, as low as $5000 to $8000.  Of course,   
there are still many above
this, but these are out of my range.
   

Can anyone tell me what I should really look for before I make the   
purchase, and also can anyone
explain to me why the price seems to be lower than expected on these fine   
automobiles?  If I am
not mistaken, I thought that 928's new were at one time $40,000 cars.   
(not much these days, but back
then...)
