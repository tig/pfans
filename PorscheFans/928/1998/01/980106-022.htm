Not quite, Leonard.  They stopped making the ClubSport before the
1988 production year, from what I can make out.  (There do seem to
be some "1988" ClubSport, but the car is quite different to the SE/Sport
and was probably just tail-end run out.)

The ClubSport is indeed 200 lbs lighter, but the SE isn't.  The SE has
the different cams and engine management to try and make up for
the extra weight being put back in.  It also has wider rear track and
a number of other subtle differences.  It is quicker than the CS, so
I guess it all worked!

I've answered the email seperately and maybe in the process I'll
learn a bit more - it'll be great talking to someone else who actually
owns one!

It's the "928 S4 Club Sport", it's the predecessor to the 928 GT, it came
in light and not-so-light versions, and it has been the subject of lots of
prior discussion on this list, so I'll step back and let those with the
facts at their fingertips (and, in at least one case, the car in his
garage) finish answering you.
