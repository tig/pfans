Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

As many of you know, my 86 is a daily driver, a track/autocross car, and a
"show" car. I will not likely win any races or concours, but it sure is fun
trying. By all means, drive your 928 as much as you want. It was made to be
an autobahn cruiser, so do it. 
Here in VA, it does occasionally snow. I have driven it in 4" inches or
less. With decent tires, it tracks as well as any other rear-wheel drive
car. Gentle application of the throttle is counter intuitive for a 928, but
one must excercise restraint when conditions warrant.

ABS was introduced in the US market in the 1985 MY as an option. For 86' it
was standard.

I still have several XL Frenzy polo shirts. The color is "Ash" with black
collar and cuffs. The logo of a 928S in profile is "teal" as is the button
down area. The price including delivery is $37. Let me know if you want one.
My e-mail address is: eds928s@erols.com

Happy motoring. Ed
