Brian...

To the best of my knowledge I didn't have a sexual affair with Mon...Oh!
Wrong question!

To the best my knowledge, the flaps in the HVAC system should be closed (at
least the central ones) when the control switch is in the OFF position,
regardless of the temperature setting.  This should completely choke off air
flow through the central vents.  If you get hot or cold air, it could be that
the flaps are not closing all the way (there is an adjustment procedure
described in the service manuals to assure that the main flaps (two) behind
the central vent fully close, one against the other).  

Of course, the other possibility is that they aren't working altogether.  If
you slide the control from one position to another you should hear the flaps
moving from one position to another...maybe you can determine if the central
vent flaps are moving by listening carefully.

My central vent "leaks" hot air from the lower left corner, which seems to
indicate that it needs to be adjusted to provide complete closure.  But I
haven't gotten around to it yet...maybe some day.  What I usually have to do
is turn the AC on to compensate for the hot "ambient" air.  I still haven't
figured out why the heater core "seems" to have water flowing through it all
the time.  There is a valve indicated in the system diagrams which should
control water flow, but I have yet to determine if it really turns the water
flow completely off.  It sure is a very complicated system.
