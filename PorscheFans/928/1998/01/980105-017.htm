I know it.  I became Porschepsychic just a little while after that 
incident.  Flew down the with family to Florida and while driving our 
rental up the Interstate there, I could say, here's comes a Porsche, 
and within a mile one would pass us.  I could do it every time, and 
never missed a one.  I've been considering the possibility of selling 
my present car to afford me an 83-86 928S, but as of yet, nothing has 
come of it.  I'd also like to get into my next job before doing so so 
that I can pay for it much easier and get all those go-fast goodies 
:)  I've already got more than 150+ pictures and video of them 
running around, so a city wide pic wouldn't do me too much good :) 
but if anybody has a poster or knows where I can get one, I'd 
appreciate it.

>A Lexus??  Tut tut.

Honest, Philip.  I'll find you a picture on one.  Its been a few 
years, back just before I become Porschepsychic.

Brian asked:

What is the best wax, car wash, and leather conditioner for my 928?
I have been told Zymol is the best wax and leather conditioner. Any truth?
What is recommended for the dashboard?

On another note: Has anyone had any luck with RainX?  I read the bottle and
like what it said, if it works.  (snip)

I use RainX and think it is a wonderful product, it both keeps the window
cleaner and extends wiper life.  With regard to the best wax, I spoke with a
couple of guys who repair/restore vintage cars and build rods, and they say
you should never ever use wax.  I have seen their shop and the work they do
(truly anal and as close to perfect as humanly possible) so I believe them.
They recommend either race glaze or hand glaze only.  BTW, they also recommend
that you never use a car cover - dust on the car is rubbed by the cover and
ruins the paint.  I told you they were picky!
