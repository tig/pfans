	I've recently moved from sunny Key Largo to cold and drabby (no
offense)
	Toronto, Canada. Although my gas consumption has gone totally
south because
	of the colder weather (I know I shouldn't be driving it) it has
been an
	incredibly good winter car until now. Yesterday morning when I
tried to
	start it, it just wouldn't turn over, the starter was working
but it just
	wouldn't start.

	Things I have tried:

	1) Gas line antifreeze
	2) Added fresh gas
	3) New spark plugs
	4) Checked fuel pump - working

	Please let me know of anything else I could try before I have to
call for a
	flatbed.

	* note - after I installed the new spark plugs, it almost
started but not
	quite.

	Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

You didn't say what year is your 928.  The first thing that comes to
mind is a stuck air flap that is part of your air mass sensor.  Of
course this is year-dependent.
