	Now an apology- wasn't the voltage regulator that "died".  It
was
	actually the voltmeter/ammeter in the dash pod.  Thats what I
get for
	surfing after beers.  Besides, I was distracted by the guy thats
been
	cruising around in Jalpas and M-1s.  Can't believe everyone let
the
	typos slide!
	[snip]
	At any rate, the seller claimed it worked intermittently, but
its been
	firmly pointed at the tar since I've owned the car.  Mechanic
claims
	inputs are O.K. but guage is bad.  Didn't look to me like
replacing
	the "guage" itself would be  a real treat.

	However, my lights do dim a bit sometimes when accessories come
on.
	Should I consider replacing the regulator as well before it
fails and
	cooks my alternator?  Where is it?

There is a shunting block directly behind the voltmeter and
instrumentation cluster housing that is probably loose.  It is held on
by a single nut.  The electrical edge connectors are also notorious for
making intermittent connection.  I have yet to see an actually DEAD
voltmeter.  VDO gauges, in my opinion, can take alot of abuse and is
quite reliable.  You need to remove the pod in order to get into the
instrumentation cluster.  R/R of the individual gauges are relatively
easy, just takes alot of patience.  I've posted a brief procedure on the
cluster removal last week and you probably haven't caught up with the
thread.  About your regulator... you did not mention which year is your
928, but probably a Paris-Rhone or a Bosch.  Both of these uses an
internal electronic regulator.  A typical regulator is quite robust.
Generally a bad rectifier diode or a diode trio would cause the
destruction of the regulator, which in turn, for the worst, overcharge
the battery, boil the electrolyte, and/or damage the plates.  As far as
testing of the alternator, I've posted a procedure for that last week as
well.
