OK guys,
Here is where things get weird.  I just went looking for option codes on
my car to compare mine with other people's, and had to call PCNA to get
some things straight.  Appareantly (according to Kay, who I spoke with
at Porsche) some things were standard in some years that weren't
standard in others.  Here's what I mean.  My car has the graduated tinit
windshield, protective side moldings, sunroof and rear a/c, but NONE of
these options showed up on my option code sticker OR in PCNA's
computer.  Explain that.  I know other's will write in and say that
these things are on their option stickers, but I am not crazy, nor do I
need glasses.  I think Porsche just did this to us to make our owner's
experience this much more gratifying (confusing?).

black/black 928S4 auto (w/ lots of options but no proof)
black/black 1979 930
green 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo

P.S. My 928 also shows option (P37), which is traction control.  NOT
limited slip, but TRAC CONTROL.  Huh.?!
