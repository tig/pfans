Yes; go for the whole package. The water pump is driven by the main timing
belt, and the labor to replace the water pump reflects basically the
removal and replacement of said belt, which itself should be replaced every
50,000 miles or so (and retensioned every 15,000 or so). Water pumps may
last longer than timing belts, but the significant common labor makes it
smart to replace both together.

New belts have a different tooth profile which require new guides and
sprockets with matching profiles. Ask your mechanic to check the belt
tensioner to see if it is due for replacement. After this work, bring the
car back within 500-1500 miles to have the new belt retensioned, then have
it retensioned every 15,000 miles or so. Make sure your mechanic has the
special tool required for checking timing belt tension on 32V cars.
