	I havn't done it yet myself.  I think that I have an instruction
	somewhere to put into the FAQ but someone on
	the list could probably answere you faster.  If I remember well,
	it is very straithforword.

	The horn pad pulls straight out.
	Watch out for the Horn wire on the pad as you remove it
	The steering wheel requires a 27 mm socket to remove it
	(but you do not need to us a steering wheel pulley as with other
	cars)
	...  (that is as far as I got so far)

You definitely have to disconnect the battery first.  On my '83 S,
remove pod and lever assembly.  Tilt pod forward to access the
instrumentation cluster.  Remove cluster from pod and disconnect the
electrical edge connectors.  I found that the speedo wire was loose but
this did not fully resolve the problem.  Turned out that the speedo unit
uses a 40-pin IC, whereby the pins are tarnished.  They are
silver-plated.  Removed IC from socket and clean with an
oxidation/contact cleaner and reinstall.  This fixed the problem.  Since
the cluster was off, I also checked the tightness of a few rivets that
are used on the flex PCB.  I found that two of them was loose, not
making a good electrical contact to the flex PCB.  I used a flat punch
and tap lightly on the rivets to tighten.  Again, this is on a '83 S.
Your mileage may vary.
