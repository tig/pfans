Philip Adamson,

It does have a relationship (velocity and weight), direct or indirect. There
is a point where and object can fly when moving at a related velocity will
fly.
You guys get quite hostile don't you, I was posing a question as to why they
designed the 928 was heavy.
Explain why a funny car lifts off (weight distribution-acceleration)
Beside, speaking of names,  this reponse was directed to Mike. Is your name
Mike or Philip?
There is a speed that any object will fly, no matter what the wieght.

Tim or TARollins (my name)
Take your pick
928S 1986
