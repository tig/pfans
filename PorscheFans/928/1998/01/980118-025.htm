Fellow sharkers,
                          After the recent postings on shock absorbers and
springs I was inspired to gaze under my car over the weekend. I always
presumed I had standard Boges. After I rubbed the dust off I found I had
light blue gas Boges, probably up dated by a previous owner along with the
GT wheels.
    a few weeks ago I purchased two booklets from DEVEK and I would like to
recomend them to all 928 enthusiasts.
    Parts and Technical Reference Catalog. $9 US.
    Part numbers, exploded diagrams (really helpfull), tech tips and tech
bulletins (updates).
     Technical Specification "Pocket book". $7 US.
    A wealth of information on most aspects of 928s. Of interest to those
people discussing shocks and coils, the section clearly explains which coils
go with what shocks. Lenghts and spring force,different coils for left and
right hand drive, non air conditioned cars (yeeecht!). The coils are colour
coded. It is suggested for early cars, with out adjustable spring struts,
that if you change to Bilstiens you change the coils as well.
    For less than $20 these booklets are hard to beat.
