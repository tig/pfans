Matt,

I agree with everything Stephane said.  Also, I had to replace the
tensioner roller and the roller bolt on mine.  It was frozen stiff -
wouldn't budge.  I think this is pretty common, but you won't know
'till you get it apart (mine's a 16 valver, not sure how similar yours
is).

Don't forget, you have to re-tension the belt again after about 1500
miles or so (I think that's what it says), so you'll need the
tensioning tool again.  :-(
