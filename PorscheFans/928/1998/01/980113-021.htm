Yep. I used the largest profile that I could for a hydraulic cam. So...how
did I test to see if that was the root of the problem? Easy. In one of my
"what in the heck is going on here" experimental drives, I got zipping along
at about 45 mph, put the car in neutral, held the gas down to get the engine
rpm up to 3 grand and keep it there and then braked with my left foot. Now,
at 3 grand, I would hope I was past the point of having a vacuum robbing cam
overlap effect...but the brakes still were crap!

How about this approach:

1) The most common symptoms of a defective master cylinder are?

2) The most common symptoms of a defective set of pressure regulators are?


No, I need the answers to be a little more detailed than, "You can't stop." !!

;-)

  BTW Vince, my first car was a 66 GTO with a 73 455 SD in it! We seem to be
  traveling similar roads in life.
