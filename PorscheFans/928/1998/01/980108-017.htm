	We can put this topic to rest by performing a simple experiment.
Any volunteers?  Phil?  It doesn't have to be a GT...  :-)

	[snip]
	  Let us assume for a
	>>moment that a '89 GT runs with the battery disconnected.  If
this is the
	>>case, then that tells me that the alternator is operating at
least 100%
	>>efficient; it generate enough electrical energy to sustain
operation by
	>>itself.  Now, what about the EFI system that is needed to
manage the
	>>engine's operation?  This system is a load.  So, if the GT
continues to
	>>operate in this manner, it tells me that the alternator is
100%+
	>>efficient.  Is that possible?  NO!  It defies all law of
physic!  If I
	>>am wrong, does that mean that we've found a way to end the
energy
	>>shortage crisis in third-world countries today as we know it?
:-)

	Vince - You're forgetting that the _engine_ is providing the
power
	to drive the alternator. The small amount of _electrical_ power
	needed is just use to drive the excitor windings. In other
words,
	there's no energy shortage as long as we've got plenty of gas.
