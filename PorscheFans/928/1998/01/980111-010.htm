 I would suspect that the cold-start valve may not be =
opening/flowing.  It is the electronic injector mounted on the front =
of the plenum.  Disconnect it and measure the resistance of the =
injector-- it should be somewhere around 10-15=87.  If it is "open", =
it's dead. There is also the chance that the two-wire harness is =
damaged/disconnected, or the controlling signal is not there at all.
