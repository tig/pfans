 Sort of. Alternators are self-sustaining once they have "boot-strapped" 
themselves.  That is, they do not need any external voltage source for 
generation of power.  One of the problems is when there is an exceedingly 
heavy load placed on them at low alternator RPM. Then it is simply a case 
of not enough EMF generated/rectified to get back into regulated 
charging/vehicle rail-voltage.  A deep-discharged battery will certainly 
require more engine RPM to charge the battery at it's (alternator) 
maximum rate.
 The other situation is at "start-up."  This is the only time the 
alternator needs an external source of excitation voltage.  When you 
first start the car, the alternator has (almost) no way of generating 
it's own stator-field, and hence cannot generate any electrical power. 
But, on most all alternators there is one additional small wire that is 
connected to V bat.  It is this wire that gives the alternator a tiny, 
but important, "boot-strap" for the internal regulator to control the 
stator winding.  If this wire is not connected, the alternator will 
(almost) never begin to output regulated power to the system.  I said 
"almost" twice because, if you rev the engine (alternator) up high enough 
(like above 4000-4500 engine RPM) there is enough hysterisis/residual 
magnetic-flux to eventually get the the alternator boot-strapped--then it 
will operate perfectly normally.  You can verify this phenomenon by 
simply disconnecting this wire.
