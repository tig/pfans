Once the alternator is running on the good battery I believe it can
feed its own field coils even without any battery.  While connected
to a running alternator (or generator), the battery is acting mainly
as a load and voltage stabilizer.  Now if the voltage regulator
disconnects the alternator's output from the battery line for too
long or if you hook up a really dead battery, the current supplied
to the field coils could drop low enough that the alternator will be
unable to maintain a field.  But other than that, I think it should
run.  However without a battery or a really, really big capacitor to
stabilize the voltage, I'd be worried about frying the car's
electronics.
