	Well here is another 2 cents of opinion on that burned 928....   A 
bargin 928 or any other car for that matter is one with a couple of 
problems, problems you know how to solve.  If it has just one problem 
that you don't know about, it could be a nightmire.  I would check the 
timing belt, take off the two  small covers, if the timing belt is intact 
and the motor will turn over with a wrench, then the motor might be OK.  
How cheaply could you fix up the interior?  A 928 is not a investment, 
not one like you described.   

	Keep in mind there are bargin 928's out there for about $5,000  that you 
can drive!  I got mine for $5,000 and have spent less than $2,000 since 
then.  I do all my own work, patched the seats, epoxy and some matching 
fabric (very close to the original blue leather) a friend works at a 
fabric store so that was free.  I still have work to do but I do drive 
the car every day, my other car is a 914 (no heat). Hopping for very 
little snow unlike a few years ago when we got 3 ft all at once!  Also 
keep in mind a 928 is more trouble than any other car to work on, any 
project will be more work.  Shocks on most cars are trivial, not so on a 
928, I did mine, ton of work.  Water pump, I can see why a shop would 
charge $500 plus,  I need to go back into that come spring, when I fix 
the oil leaks.  The water pump/t-belt can become very  involved, expect 
to make theard repairs to the aluminum block, replace all the rollers, 
check the alignment of the tensioner.  My belt rides at the front of the 
pulleys not the middle as it should, (tensioner pivot problem, will 
rebuild the part) so I will tear it all apart again after only a year, 
wouldn't dare let it go 60,000 miles like that! There are no minor 
repairs on a 928, but that is what keeps the purchase price down.  If you 
are real handy, can even make or repair parts, then a 928 can be a real 
bargain. When I made a U-turn/backed up  I ripped off the spoiler and 
part of the grile (gill), repaired and made new parts for the grill, 
replaced the cheap plastic parts with aluminum.   Before you buy a 928 
get the Chilton book, it will give you some idea as to what is involved 
and a intro to the car, the day you buy the car throw the chilton book 
away and get the factory books!

	I wonder how did the fire start?  There are little rubbber hoses from 
the fuel rail to the injectors, mine have some dry rot (very little), I 
don't see any clamps, should we change those hoses every 10 or 15 years?  
Do we have to replace the injector to replace the little hose. My 914 has 
little hoses, similar setup but it has a clamp on each end.  Can we cut 
the old hose off the injector and put a new hose on with clamps, of 
course this would again be a big job, manifold kind of in the way.  
Something always in the way, remove these 3 or 4 things to get at the 
thing that needs fixing!

	Last and least; the 928 is by far the worst snow/ice car I have ever 
driven, but it can be driven very carfully, well you gotta be carfull on 
wet pavement, ice is no better! 



TED HEINRITZ	83 928S	and 914 almost stock, makes lots of noise!

No snow yet, Philadelphia
