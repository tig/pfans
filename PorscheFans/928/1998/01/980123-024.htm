Sorry guys I'm mad as hell and can't take it anymore!
I've been a PCA MEMBER a long time and the comments on the PCA ZONE
ONE TECH TACTICS make me siiiiiiick!

Many of you aren't aware of the bias among the organizers and how they 
are extremely fraternal in their choice of speakers.

One of the most notable and key people in Porsche performance and
racing(indeed the consistently fastest overall) for many years is most
notably left off the speaker list time and time again.  

I've found him to be extreme in his knowledge and very entertaining when 
he would speak at METRO PCA functions.  I figure the N.Englanders who 
put on the same boring crap year after year, would welcome this 
speaker.  And as far as that guy Newton goes, maybe I'm misfiring but 
what history does he have in performance work and winning races?

I can't drop the name of this notable tuner in NYC, because he'd
probably piss on me for starting trouble.  I feel the need to promote 
aknowledgeable man in a field full of bull.
