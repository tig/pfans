Phil,

This may come as a rude shock to you but to the best of my knowledge a =
prerequisite for 928 ownership does not include membership in the =
knights of the round table or the acquisition of 23 merit badges.  I had =
a neighbor who owned a beautiful 88S4 who was such a loud overbearing =
oaf that some of our mutual neighbors drilled holes in the hull of his =
80 mph 1600 H.P. Fountain speedboat that he loved to wake his neighbors =
with early on Saturday & Sunday mornings by blasting back and forth in =
front of their homes on the intrcoastal waterway at a decibel level just =
short of a Mt. St. Helens eruption.=20

The following morning, he fired up the engines while the boat was still =
on it's hydraulic lift, dropped the boat into the water, and about ten =
minutes later turned it into the world's fastest instant submarine. He =
exited facefirst over the windshield and witnesses said he skipped like =
a stone at least six or seven times before he fetched up solid in the =
water.

This only came about after months of  pleas from said neighbors to cool =
it with the revs until he got out in the channel a half mile away.  =
Everything worked out for the best though.  It cost so much to salvage =
the boat that he had to sell me the 928 which he had been terrorizing =
the residents of Hutchinson Island with for some time because he'd =
removed the muffler from that also.  =20

Shortly thereafter he got his third DUI and had to leave Florida.  Come =
to think of it.  Maybe the ghost of Ferry Porsche has some serious pull =
and decided that this cretin was the only 928 driver who lacked sterling =
qualities.
