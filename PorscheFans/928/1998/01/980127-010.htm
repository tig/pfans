The car in question, a 740IL, had been driven about a block or so =
through water eight or ten inches deep when the engine suddenly quit. =
The local BMW dealer currently has six or seven similar cars with ruined =
engines from the same morning last week.  Talking to my Porsche mechanic =
last night, he told me that in their wisdom, the BMW engineers designed =
the 740 and 750 series engines with the air intake on the bottom of the =
block, driven by a vacuum boosted system.  Why they did this is a =
mystery, at least to me. But they have apparently had a recall on the =
750s and possibly one on the 740s regarding the induction system.

Not bad enough to have the intake down low, but with somewhere between =
12 and 16 pounds of vacuum boost, it probably only takes a couple of =
seconds to slurp up a whole gang of water.  Just thought I'd throw in a =
few technical terms like that.  At this point, it seems that Capt. Nemo, =
my son in law, is covered by the flood damage provision in his policy, =
but it he isn't, it may be covered by BMWs warrantee.

So much for the genius of German  engineering.
