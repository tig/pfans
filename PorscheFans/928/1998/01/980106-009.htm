If she did, first she'd raise the cow herself (on grains and hay she
cultivated
on her sod roof)....

I did a single-needle job on mine.  Took me 3 hours.

I know that someone who is in Long Island bought an 83 from them but don't
know much about how it's going. I have talked to them several times and they
seem to know a lot about the 928's, solving some problems and so forth... I
haven't had any work done though.
