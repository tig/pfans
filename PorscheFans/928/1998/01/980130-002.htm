(Who does not master the english vocabulary very well? Oh No, I am doomed,
curses and am not worthy to be in the presence of the Mighty Vocabulary GOD
Andy McIntyre!  I am not worthy, I am not worthy "boo who, woe is me)  lol.
get off your pedestal Andy. 928 owner come from all levels of intellect. Did
I communicate that well enough.  Your humble student TIM

Why the insults Andy, I see nothing wrong with my vocabulary (I sometimes am
doing two this at a time and am prone to errors). Because you have an
(perfecto Mundo) excellent vocabulary does that make you the better person.
I think not!
Insecurity breed that kind of behavior. I came to this group for an
intellegent discussion. And all I find is a few pompous asses among true 928
fanatics. Andy why are you so rude does it anger you to debate and discuss
or is it that you always want to be right. This list is not about vocabulary
or English 101, but about discuss of a common thing, communication. Let's
stick with what brings us together. Besides, I think you got me mixed up
with someone else (I never mentioned a Corvette).
Thank for the insult you truly are a great person (O mighty one).

Ich spreche Duetsch
Hablo espanol tambien
