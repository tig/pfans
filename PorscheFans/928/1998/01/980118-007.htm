Anthony,

Typical early syncro failure.   It will not get any better and the transmission
will have to be rebuilt for it to be fixed.   It is typical only insofar as the 
earlier cars were prone to early syncro failure and will not tolerate
abuse (speed shifting).    I'm sure yours works better when the
transmission has warmed up a little bit.   Internally there are two
surfaces (the inside of the operating sleeve and the outside of the
syncro ring) that must remain in spec so that friction can bring the 
speed of one shaft up to that of the other.    Over time and/or with
abuse these surfaces become smooth and they get worse and worse
at effecting this mutual friction.    The earliest signs of this failure are
rough shifting when the transmission is cold.   It will eventually progress
to where all upshifts and downshifts into that gear will not be possible
without double clutching.

The grinding you feel is when the operating sleeve teeth and the "dog teeth"
on the gear itself clash when brought together whenever the shafts have failed
to achieve identical speeds (the function of the synchronization process).  
If you do not get the syncros fixed, you may eventually begin knocking these
dog teeth off and have little chunks of metal floating around in the
transmission.
You might imagine the potential.

A full repair of this transmission should include operating sleeves and
syncro rings
for first through third gears, and the dog teeth for any gear that has clashed
much.   Figure at least twelve hours of billed labor and about $200 per gear
for the job.   

Meanwhile, I would recommend you either avoid using the gears that grind,
or develop your double clutching abilities.

Yeah,

The $500 charge for pump replacement is right.  If I remember correctly,
replacing my pump was around the same amount, if not more (and this includes
buying a $125 rebuilt unit).  I certainly concur with Leonard, if the belts
haven't been replaced, do it since the labor cost to get to them is high and
you're already there when you're replacing the pump.

Conversely, if you replace the belts, replace the pump at the same time for
the same reason - high common labor charge.  The PO replaced the belts on my
car at 45K miles, and I then had to replace the pump at 52K miles - what a
waste of money considering how cheap a replacement pump is.  And remember,
pump failure is very common on these cars (mileage wise), esp. those that
aren't used frequently.  My pump was the second replacement, but on the other
hand, the car is 11 years old and doesn't have a lot of miles for its age,
which is not a good thing for seals (or pumps).

Hopefully, staying away from phosphate AND silicate containing antifreezes
will make your new pump last longer.
