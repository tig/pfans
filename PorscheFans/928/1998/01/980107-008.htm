Hi folks,

My engine temperature rarely gets past the first mark on the guage.  I
don't know whether it's the sensor/guage circuit or the thermostat, but I
thought I'd start with the thermostat.  Can anyone tell me where the
thermostat is on an '85?  The workshop manuals don't help much.  

It looks like the thermostat is in the connection to the lower radiator
hose since that appears to have a removable housing where it goes into the
engine.  However, my limited experience is that thermostats are usually in
the upper hose line.  The upper line enters the engine underneath of a
bunch of wires and a couple of fuel system hoses so due to the increased
difficulty of getting to it, I suspect that's where it is but I don't see a
detachable housing.

Any hints on thermostat replacement and/or sensor/guage troubleshooting
would be very much appreciated.
