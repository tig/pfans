Barry,

  In addition to what Dave Nicholson suggested (i.e. the rear shift rod
  connection), you'll also need to look at the ball cup that attaches the
  front shifter guide rod to the torque tube.  The nylon insert in the ball
  cup will wear with age and will pop off its mount leaving you unable to shift.
