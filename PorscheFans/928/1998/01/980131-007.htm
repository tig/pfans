It was I, Ed Ruiz at: eds928s@erols.com, and If you pay the postage - yes.
I do have a couple of brochures for the 89 model yr.

As far as additives to the oil - Don't do it. Save your money & your engine
by using a quality oil.  If you do lots of stop & go driving, change it and
the filter frequently.

My door lock broke recently. There is no repair or lubrication to do.
Replacement is the fix.

Tony Lapine is the designer of the 928 (also the: 917, 924, 944, and
others). Shame on those that didn't know.

If you have 255/50 tires on 7" rims, you are asking for trouble. DO NOT take
corners briskly!
The recommended size for 7" rims is 225/50. Anything over that exceeds the
ability of the rim to hold the tire in at the beads. I have seen this set-up
and it looks scary.

Finally, the 928 weighs about 3200 to 3700 pounds depnding on model and
equipment. A great deal of that weight is due to the frame which is NOT
aluminum. The 928 was meant to be the Porsche "flagship" Thus, it was
over-designed, like a "Sports Car Tank." Nonetheless, it is still the most
road-worthy car Porsche ever made. Like most of you, I hope to keep mine for
a very long time.

Happy motoring. Ed
