As I mentioned on a previous post, Circle imports in Long Beach
 has a special on oil filters. These are made in Germany by Mann. Cost is $2.50.

I got the filters 4 days ago and they still had them in stock.

The phone number of Circle Imports is 1-800-675-2472, 1-562-597-3663.

Steve,

I have a '88S4 and '94GTS both autos and I find that the S4 shifts better.  I
am not sure what kind of fluid my mechanic put into it but it works well.  The
GTS is new to me and may just need to have its tranny fluid changed to
something fresher.  I will be doing the 30k check up on it soon and will have
that done then.

I drive frequently at Texas World Speedway and just put the car in drive and
leave it there for the track.  It will shift down to 2 from time to time but
is usually in 3 and gets to 4 at the end of the front straight (about 130mph).

It is a total kick and the next event will be Feb 22-23 (I think I got those
dates right anyway), and I will be using some R1's for the first time ever.
Looking forward to busting a few air heads with these highly upgraded tires
(over my new D40M2's).

Good luck and have fun!!
