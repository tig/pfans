Here's the deal. Don't expect to just buy a $5,000
928, and have it be the car of your dreams. The
cheaper the car is, the more work you are going to
have to put into it. If your budget is only allowing
$5K for the car, don't be surprised if you have to
spend several thousand more in the first few years
on repairs. The old, worn out 928s are just waiting
to blow a tranny, *timing belt*, or engine. Many of
these repairs can cost more than you paid for the
car. 928's were $50-60K cars, but what they are to
the 928 owners is 50-60K worth of "Porsche" parts to
be replaced by us at varying intervals. And, when
you say to yourself, "OK, I'll pay $5K, but leave
$5K in the bank for repairs..." My response is that
if you spend 10K on the very best 928 you can find,
you may not have to do many repairs at all. It all
depends on how much work you are willing to do
yourself, and if you have other forms of
transportation. A $5K 928 is a great "hobby" car.
But if it's to be your daily driver, I'd opt for a
newer one. I looked at some of the cheaper 928s when
I was looking for mine, intending on spending the
extra cash on paint, rims, etc. Many of them had
shiny new paint jobs, but were hiding a plethora of
leaks and  mechanical woes. The best thing is to
have your potential car checked out by a 928
mechanic. There will always be other cars, so don't
worry about someone buying the car while you wait to
get it checked. It'll be worth your while, and can
be a useful bargaining tool. Good luck with your
mission.
