My father's '96 Carrera 4 has brakes that would make your eyes bulge out
when stopping; most car magazines report excellent class leading braking
from that car in comparison to others. Stopping figures on these cars
should be readily available, and are shorter than 928 distances. It's not
just the brakes; a 928 has more mass behind it than a 911.

I knew a gent who owned a hopped up '96 supra with racing pads. He had just
put the pads on the night before, and when backing out of his driveway the
next morning, he hit a car parked across the street. He said he just
coudn't stop with the brakes fully depressed, and said that it felt like
the rotors where made of teflon. Upon adjusting to the brakes, he said he
usually drove the first block from his house with the brakes lightly
depressed to warm up the pads. He said stopping distances were remarkable
after they were warm.

It's no accident that cross drilled rotors come as OEM equipment on all new
911s, and 99% of race cars. I have never heard of any problems with C4s,
turbos, or C2s regarding the cross drilled rotors, and have seen many late
model 911s race at PCA events without concern for the brakes. Porsche would
put  spiral slotted brakes on their cars from the factory if they are truly
superior.
