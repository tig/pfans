Right on!

$13 at Baxter's Auto Parts.  For cheap parts like this,
save yourself some worrying, esp. if it's an older one
like mine (82)....hell, 16 years is a lot of time for many
little moving parts, rubber bits, etc....

Sounds like the way mine works.  Also note that when
the lower lever is set to defrost, it automatically cranks
the air hot and the fan on hi.
