Run a VIN check over the net....I'll research the URL. It costs about
12.50 and can tell you any mileage recorded-and information such as when
it was salvaged and why....

<smaller>This afternoon as a favor to a friend of mine who is a mechanic,
tool & die maker, but has scant knowledge of 928s,  I went with him to a
junkyard out on the edge of the glades and looked at an 83 that had light
fire damage under the hood. Visually it looked like fire damage was
confined to ignition wires etc.

</smaller>  

<smaller>The body is dent free, white, but in need of a paint job.  The
odometer reads 86K but from the look of the interior, I'd guess that it
was the second time around.  Interior sucks. door panels loose, warped,
and cruddy, same for dash.

No radio, or speakers.  Seats okay if they were cleaned up. dash and
instrument panel salvageable but nothing to write home about.  Rubber,
margineable, two or three tires flat, probably from sitting there for
some time.  

</smaller>  

<smaller>Owner claims he bought it from an insurance company after it
burned.  Its

a five speed and theres no way of telling at this point if the engine is
okay.

</smaller>  

<smaller>My friend, being a mechanic, thinks that he can get it running
and looking half way decent for a two or three thousand dollars.  I've
bought and sold a lot of 928s but they were always in good condition. 
I'd like whatever input any of you might give.  The junkyard guy wants
2500.00 for the car and my friend thinks he might get it for 21 or 22
hundred.

</smaller>  

<smaller>If the engine is kaput, are the rest of the parts worth him
spending  that much money?  He'd like to fix it up for himself.  Was
always happy with his Mustang GT until I let him drive the 85S I sold the
other day.  Now he's hot for a 928 but can't afford a good one.
