HA!  This is too funny!  I will admit to wondering about baking bread on
top of the airbox but then I woke up!

You guys crack me up!

Friends,

I've been away from the list for nearly a month due to an exciting change in
my life.  I will, in February, assume the post of executive director of the
superb Shreveport Symphony Orchestra.  My move from Tucson will henceforth
change my late '86 5-speed ("Colonel Stapp") from an Arizona Sandshark to a
Louisiana Swampshark.

I said goodbye to the excellent folks at Tucson's Frankin Services with a
transmission fluid change (they highly recommended Swepco's dino juice based
on their racing experience... if I don't see any real improvement I'll switch
to the Redline synthetic at the next change) and topping up all of the other
fluids.  I also moved up to 44psi front/40psi rear on my Dunlop D40
225/60-16's and find the steering much sharper without any noticable ride
penalty (on original springs & shocks @ 102k miles).

Of course, I must now find a new mechanic/shop to guide me in the care of my
cartilageneous creature.  There is a Porsche dealer in S-Port, but... (you
know).  Any recommendations?

The negative of this move is that I am now even farther from Devek, 928 Int'l
and certain SF brewpubs.  The positive is that I'll be that much closer to the
East coast Frenzy (hi, Ed!).

My drive east will take me through the vastness of West Texas... perfect Burma
Shave sign country... you could do "War & Peace" in a day at a triple digit
pace!

I hope to get back into the list habit after I get settled in.

Rob Gold

P.S.
Leonard, this IS west of the Mississippi (just).
