	A while ago sombody gave some info about how to fix the voltmeter, and 
then recently somebody said they never fail.  Well mine didn't work very 
well, so I went to radio shack to look for the recomended 100 ohm 
potentiometer.  Well they didn't have that but they did have a bag of 
assorted ones for about $3.00, how could I lose?  Well some wern't marked 
but using a meter I found a 200 ohm petentiometer, that worked.  It was a 
little tricky to mount/solder the new part on, but I figured nothing to 
lose, it don't work now!  I just love projects that you can't make 
worse...  Anyhow you don't have to be real picky about finding a 100 ohm 
potentimeter, a larger one will work but will make the adjustment more 
sesitive.  I think you could go as high as 500, so long as it will fit, 
thats part of the trick.  I happend to have 2 six volt batteries and some 
D cells in the den (airplane shop), so I was able to adjust it before 
going back into the unheated garage.  12 volts battery, 12 plus D cell 
charging.....

	I am all for not turning this list into a english or spelling class, I 
for one am glad I passed english classes and went on to more worthwhile 
engineering classes.   Which is worth more to the NAVY?  Which is more 
fun?

	I am totally against using any oil additives, I used to sell NEO oil, 
its the best.  There are plenty of reports about oil additives, none 
good!  I plan to write a little article on how to pick a good oil, they 
all have to pass the same tests, NEO would give out comparisson data from 
these tests. Bit of triva, what oil has the highest film strength? 
Caster, you can get it at the drug store, wouldn't put it in a car, works 
great to make model airplane fuel!  I heard (could be wrong) Castrol oil 
has some caster oil, thats why it works better than other petroluim oils. 
Of course that could also explain all the sludge in the escort I had, 
200,000 miles.  I had a T-bird turbo coupe, the blower made noise, 
changed the oil, same problem, changed to castrolsytech, same problem, 
then mobil 1 synthetic, no luck, finally found NEO, problem gone.  Drove 
the car for years, yes it was easier and cheaper to change the oil rather 
than the turbo!
