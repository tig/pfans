this is interesting.

i was under the impression that on the early cars, the 
sunroof was optional ('78-81, perhaps?) and that on
the later cars, it was standard, and you had to specifically
order one without to get it removed. i seem to remember the
articles in the 'Performace Portfolio' said that it was an
option on early cars.
