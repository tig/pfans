I used my '88 5 spd for everyday transport for six months and based on that
I would say it would be no more expensive than running a 5 series BMW over
the same mileage.  (The car I owned before the Porsche was a 535.)  Mine
has done 95000 miles and needed a few things sorting out on it, but since
then (I've owned it 18 months) it's only needed the normal regular servicing
and it hasn't missed a beat.

It's certainly a buzz to use everyday.  I stopped for a three reasons. First,
I got a bit lazy and wanted an auto for the stop-start traffic - it's not that I think
that the 928 will burn clutches any faster than anything else, it's just a heavy
clutch and in any traffic jams I just couldn't be bothered!  Secondly, I am in
and out of quite tight parking buildings a lot and I was always worried... ummm...
okay, laziness again!  But mainly, I carry computer gear around a lot and I
was concerned about wear and tear on the car and the fact that I couldn't get
a 17" monitor in the box in the car at all.

That sounds like shit to me.  I am pretty certain that if there isn't a Porsche
factory clutch there will be an equivalent or a relined one.  I will, however,
check on that.

Using the 928 every day really was fun.  I looked forward to driving to work, and
I generally stayed late to avoid the traffic and have a good drive home.  Heading
in to town during the day was even a blast and it sure gave my technicians
something to talk about when they had to go somewhere with me.  (One guy
visited three clients with me on his first day with us and I heard much later that
he couldn't stop talking about his new job, were he spent all of his first day
riding around in a Porsche!)

Do it.  Spend a little more, sure, maintaining it, but hey, if it doesn't work out
you can always stop and get an econobox again.
