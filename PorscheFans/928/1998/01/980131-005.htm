A couple questions:

1. I usually see references to flatbedding disabled 928s back to a shop. Is
that a preferred optional transport method or is that the only safe way to
move it? I looked in my owners manual and found no reference to towing (I
guess Porsche thought towing wouldn't be neccessary).

2. In all the discussions on ProLong, I enjoyed the smarty-pants answers
but I didn't hear a specific answer on why most 928 owners wouldn't use it.
I get a hoot out of the commercial though. I wouldn't use it primarily
because my owner's manual says not to use additives however, it was written
in 1984 and ProLong was probably developed since then. I've spoken to a few
people who wouldn't use it because they had "a weird feeling" about it or
they heard some obscure rumours. With all the weight vs. aerodynamics
scientists out there, does anyone have a tangible chemical, physical, or
mechanical reason not to use the goop? Cheers!

I think animal testing is a terrible idea
they get all nervous and give the wrong answers
