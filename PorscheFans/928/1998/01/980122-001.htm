Hi all,

We have a '81 928 (fairly standard) that we only bought a few days ago and
today my wife let a friend drive our car....(I can feel you all wince as
well, this was -in retrospect- a very bad idea, because this particular
friend is an immature driver).... She called me from the friend's place to
tell me that she couldn't get the ignition key back into the barrel
properly :-(.

I grabbed our work car, and headed over. The 928 was sitting on about a 30
Deg. slope facing up, with the afternoon sun coming straight down on us
(37 Deg Celcius today).  The key would only go about 1/2 inch into the
ignition and then stop, on closer inspection, one of the wafers on the
key-switch had burred - uh oh.. and the key was damaged - uh oh uh
oh...... With a small file I was able to polish up the wafer correctly and
insert the key ;-), and then make the car driveable. Now comes the
problem, I don't wish to remove the key, because the Porche Dealer in
Brisbane (about 120km away) says that the key-switch is a throw away item
- not fixable(therefore the replacement cost is also going to be
ridiculously high), so If I remove the key I may never get it back in...
My locksmith has tells me that the barrel should be able to be worked on
easily, however he admits that he hasn't ever worked on a porsche
key-switch before (There isn't a big demand around this area) so no
guarrantees.

I have faith in my locksmith - he is a very respected and resourceful man,
so I'm going to give him the chance to save me heaps of money, and
recondition the barrel (aren't I gracious ;-) ).

If anyone has any info that may be of use, please let me know, I really
want to have my baby working nicely again

Cheers,

Dale
