These amazing engines like to suck in a lot of air and a little fuel, at
least by volume.  The piston comes up to compress the mixture, at which time
a spark is offered to the compressed mixture.  With luck, you get combustion.

These amazing engines do not like to suck in a lot of water and a little
fuel.  The inertia of the rotating parts, helped by the other cylinders that
are still making full horsepower on air and fuel, tries to compress the
water mixture, but can't.  (Third law of engine hydraulics or something like
that...)  So something gives.  A normal failure would include at least one
bent or broken connecting rod, and perhaps the broken rod slapped the
aluminum block and ventilated it.

Total damage would include the block, the head(s), rods and pistons,  plus
the crank is probably tweaked and other consequential damage.  This is the
whole engine...  Add in a few hours of labor at BMW's minimum-wage labor
rates,  and I can see how the bill could reach $17k.

Sounds like your son needs to get his kneepads on and go visit his insurance
agent.  This kind of stuff is usually covered by a comprehensive insurance
package.  And we wonder why the rates for exotics are so high...
