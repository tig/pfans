My 79 doesn't stop worth a crap. New rotors and new pads all the way around.

Here are some interesting details/symptoms:

I go for a 2 mile drive and apply significant pressure...enough that there
would be total lock-up with my 84 928. But the 79 acts like I'm only applying
enough pressure for a mild, friendly, 25 mph neighborhood stop. I cannot get
the car to lock-up at all. The brakes feel mushy. I've bled them 3 times. No
more air bubbles.

I'll drive around and use the brakes quite a bit, purposely trying to get the
feel of what is (or is not) happening here. I get back to my garage and reach
through the wheels and touch the rotors. The fronts are warm to hot, the rears
are barely warm. This is interesting, considering the diagonal brake circuit
division of the 79. Why would both rears be equally cool and both fronts be
equally warm?

The brake booster field tests seems to pass. This is the test where you put
your foot on the brake and then start the car (the pedal should be sucked down
and it is). The other part of the field test is to shut the car off, wait a
couple of minutes and then push the brakes. I hear the vacuum escaping a little
more with each succesive pump (up till about 5 pumps...then it's "spent") and
the pedal goes down the furthest on the first pump (which it should).
Admittedly, I don't even understand how/why the booster works. I mean, if 
vacuum is constantly drawing and pulling the master cylinder piston into the
master cylinder, then why doesn't this cause the brakes to be applied sans
foot pressure? 

There is a seperate pressure regulator for each rear brake. I don't have the
testing equipment to determine if these are regulating as designed. But what are
the chances that both are equally failing? Remember, both rear discs are equally
barely warm after each test drive.

Many have helpfully suggested that new rotors and pads take a while to bed in.
Yes, that's true...but I would guess that there would still be the ability to
lock the wheels at _some_ speed. Not on this car!

Of course, now I faced with the dilemma of finding the root of the problem and
I need help. I really don't _want_ to have to go through the pain and expense
of replacing the booster, master cylinder and pressure regulators if someone
out here can point me to the real problem.

And does ANYBODY understand what the heck the primary and secondary master
cylinder circuits are and how they work and what they do?

Please, offer me your opinions/diagnoses. Why can't I lock 'em up?

BTW - I've been on vacation in Tucson for the last 2 weeks. Now I get to play
      "catch up" on the digest and I LOVE IT!
