     I have a 1982 928. The driver side door lock has always been hard to
     insert the key. Now I can not insert the key to unlock the door. I 
     have used graphite to lubricate the lock, but that did not work. Does 
     anyone have any suggestion and has anyone replaced a lock. Thanks

     I had the same problem with my '82 928.  I happened to try the spare 
     key and it worked fine and has been for months.  I guess the original 
     got worn to the point where it just wouldn't go in for some reason.  
     You might want to try getting a duplicate made or even seeing if you 
     can get the code from Porsche for cutting an entirely new key. It 
     would be a lot easier than getting new locks.  They are not cheap and 
     I think Porsche sells them by the pair.  (I think I asked at the 
     garage and they were over $200 for the pair).  Just a thought.

Hello everyone, I have a pair of Infinity Kappa 462P 4x6 plate that fits in
the doors of early 928's, 78 - 84 or 85,(not sure when they changed the door
panel and speakers), but they fit directly behind the mesh on the door panels.
They are very good speakers and fit with no mods and are still in the box.
List price is 160, I'll take b/o.
