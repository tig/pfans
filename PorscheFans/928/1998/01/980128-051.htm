I wonder if someone can help.....

I have a 1984 euro (just purchased) which appears to have a
unexplainable
electrical fault.

When the head lights are turned on without the ignition on all is OK,
but with the ignition on the warning light comes on that is located near
the radio and the instrument panel warning shows "Tail Light Warning".

I have checked all the lights/bulbs and all are OK !!

All I can do is press the warning light (button) and drive with the
warning still on on the instrument panel.

The parking lights work OK (no warning lights come on).

Also what is unusual is that if the blinker is left on when the ignition
is turned off, the rear blinker (on whichever side) will stay
continuously on.

The local Porsche workshop has had a quick look and have checked a
device
under the dash and say that it works fine but could not in the brief
time I had there give me a reason for the fault. 

So before I spend $70 an hour in labour at Porsche to solve the problem
I thought someone can help !!

Thanking You.
