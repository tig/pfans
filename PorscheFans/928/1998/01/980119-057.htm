For all of you beached sharks, I have a suggestion.  Get a Subaru SVX.
I'm talking the loaded AWD model with leather,S/R and CD which stickered
about $35M. You can buy them now for around $10M and you'll learn to
enjoy ice and snow driving. I won't go into all the technical stuff
about it, but its an amazing car on the slick or dry.

Sounds like this guy has never done a 928 water pump before.  I don't think I
have ever seen it done for less than $1k.  This is a huge job but I do agree
that changing the T-belt should be done too.  If this guy has never done one
before I would look for someone who has.  If they get the tension wrong on the
T-belt (which does drive the water pump) then you will total your car...the
engine costs over $9k to fix when a slip occurs....well it can cost that much
or more depending on internal damage.

Ask lots of Q's about what this guy knows about 928's and if he knows a lot
and still wants to do a pump for $500 send him to the Austin area.  ;)

Jim,

If I were in your shoes I would get a nice low mileage '90 or '91 and then use
it when you wanted to have fun (or even an '87 or up S4) and buy some other
car as the daily driver.  That way you do not have to totally rely on the 928
and you can have a really nice car that stays that way.  Incidentally it seems
the low mileage cars hold their value way better than the high.  It is really
weird to see how a low mileage older car will bring quite a bit more than a
high mileage newer one.

That is just my $9.28 worth...take it for what it is...a personal opinion.

>The price in 90 was  $75,000<

Interesting....in '88 my S4 was $75,243...I have the window sticker, and
considering the '88 price my '94 GTS is still more interesting as it was
appox. $83k or a touch more.  Shows how strong the dollar was in the early and
mid '90's relative to its low in the late '80's.

I liked the info from the brochure...pretty cool.  I have the one for my '88
that the PO picked up while considering this car.

Or... you could throw a "bazooka tube" in the back and forget about it, but
that's kinda
like putting Wal-Mart tires on it  :)

I resent that!!  I have a Bazooka in my S4 and it sounds great, and the
luggage cover hides it so no one has to know it is there.  I have the 8" one
now but apparently the PO started with the 6" and was dissatisfied.  Actually
my S4 system w/ Bazooka sounds better then my 10 speaker MB Quart system with
Alpine Amp in my GTS.
