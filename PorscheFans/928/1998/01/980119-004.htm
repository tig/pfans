Great find!  I am still amazed at the number of super low mileage cars
you fans have been finding lately.  'Course I'm still second guessing
myself on not getting Fat Albert at the time but very happy with Big
Blue now rolling on mid 80k mileage.

I would not recommend mating any aftermarket alarm with the factory
issue.  Your typical local alarm and stereo installer would just @#$T
the car.  What I would do is try to be the least instrusive on the
factory harness and utilize an alarm brain with shock/motion detection,
radar for interior intrusion and audio discrimination for glass
breakage.  Flashing red lights and warn-away features are great.  Ground
strap detection is good too if you want to protect your
stereo/amps/etc.  It's your call whether or not to tap into the 'dome'
light wiring.  Adding relays etc. to pop open the hatch & doors, start
the motor and such is asking for trouble regarding panel fitment, etc. 
I don't mean to sound discouraging but I have seen nightmare installs
and unhappy owners.

Window tinting is much more fun.  Illegal to do the doors here in
California but many do them anyways albeit in a very light 10-20%
gradation.  Limo tinting the rear is also popular but very permanent
(remember those defroster traces).  The key to an excellent 928 tint is
finding an installer with the know-how to do a one-piece fitment of the
rear quarter windows for the no-seam look.  The large hatch glass
normally takes two pieces anyways but the cut can be effectively hidden
by following one of the defroster traces. 
 
Some say the best tint comes from 3M.  Others say Gila.   Again I
haven't seen much difference there, it's the install that's critical to
get smooth, bubblefree results.  A very cost effective mod at around
$125 installed.

I did the rear on my old '84 with 80% tint and it was hard to spot cops,
uh, I mean it was pretty dark at night!  Parking wasn't too bad with 50w
halogens in the reverse lights.  The GT is also tinted all the way
around but is slightly lighter and I like it better that much also.  So
my advice would be not to go too dark on the rear window. 

Did you get a luggage cover with your car?
