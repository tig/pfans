>After sitting for a week or two, my batter seems a little low.  It was
newtwo years ago. The  voltmeter on the dash shows a little over 12 volts
when it is running.  Using a VOM, when I check the voltage at the front
terminal, it reads about 13.8-14 volts when running, and about 12 when shut
off. Does the charging circuit sound OK if i'm getting these readings? I
suspect that the dash guage is not that accurate. I'll measure the voltage
at the battery next and it should be similar to what I see at the charging
terminal under the hood. Are there points in the long cable from the battery
that get loose or corroded? Or is my battery done after two years?

That depends on how you have been maintaining it. If it's one of those
"Freedom" or "No maintenance" batteries, then it can and does happen. The
guage is not 100% accurate. Taking several readings at key points is far
more accurate. However, most electrical originate from a faulty or weak
battery. I advise all to replace those so called "Freedom" batteries with
OEM or Interstate or the best Die Hard they can fit in the battery
compartment. Be sure to get the one that has covered terminals. Type 91 I
think.

Happy motoring. Ed
