Howdy from the states, Ferenc!!!

The prices that you stated are seen here in the US for 928s.  They don't =
hold there value anywhere.  There are great to get into initially, but =
the upkeep and maintenance can put a real hurtn' on what you budgeted to =
spend on the car.  I don't know if you get the archive from =
www.porschefans.com but, there is an advertisement for an 82, 5-speed, =
66,000 miles for US $4900.  That's a pretty good price.  I looked at a =
1990 S4 with 47,000 miles this weekend and I don't have a doubt in my =
mind that I could get it for less than $20,000.  Its a buyers market!!!  =
Be picky!!!

I am not sure how part prices compare in Europe, but 928s in general are =
considered an expensive car to maintain.  I have a US 1986S and I love =
it, but sometimes I wonder if it is a thief or a car.  If I were you, I =
would buy as new and low mile a car as you can afford.  As far as =
general things to look for when buying one, here are my suggestions:

1.  928s are known for engine oil leaks, cost my $1800 to have mine =
fixed.  Boy was I surprised when I got that bill!@#$
2.  Is the rubber good?  Good performance tires are not cheap!!!
3.  How are the shocks?  These puppies don't have $19.99 monroes on em.
4.  How about brakes?  Early 928's, pre S4 brakes eat rotars.  Make sure =
they are not cracked or that they have been replaced at least once on a =
high mileage car.
5.  Has the Timing belt been replaced?  With a 140k car you should be on =
the third belt and looking to get the fourth soon.  This is an absolute =
must!!!  If that belt goes on a early 32-valve car, you can probably =
consider it junk.  Replacing a 32-valve engine in big $$$.  I don't know =
much about the 16-valve engine tolerance for timing belt breakage, but I =
would find out.  The folks at 928 International www.928intl.com are a =
good resource for prices and info.  They could tell you exactly how much =
a replacement engine would be.
6.  How does the torque tube sound?  This is a common part to fail in =
928's.  Not easy to diagnose either, but if the car has a constant =
vibration/noise at a certain RPM in any gear, park, reverse and neutral =
then the T/tube is probably bad.  Not fun to replace.
7.  How is the steering Rack?  Any leaks out of the boots...
8.  A/C work well?
9.  Any rattles or weird occurrence when using the climate control =
system?
10.  Is the leather in good shape?
11.  Do the windows go up and down smoothly?  Repairing internal window =
problems is a pain.
12.  If the seats are electric, do they function well?
13.  If, auto - does the shifter feel as though it is in good shape, yep =
the leather covered piece of plastic.  This is a $450 part from the =
factory, there is one other aftermarket solution for less.
14.  Do the doors close well?
15.  Does the rear trunk release work, on both sides?
16.  Cruise control work?
17.  If auto, does the tranny feel tight, no slippage. =20
18  If manual, when was the clutch redone on a high mile car.  I don't =
know the tolerance for 928 clutch's, someone else from the list could =
help you with that.
19.  Make sure that the seller has good records and has cared for the =
car!!!

I could go on, but must get back to work.  In general I hope that I have =
not scared you, 928s are great, fun cars to drive and own, but make sure =
that you avoid as many of these problems as possible.  Many times when =
someone is selling one of these cars, it is because there are major =
repairs that are needed that they don't want to do.  So... they try to =
make is someone else's problem.  Have a good 928 mechanic check the car =
out.  You won't regret spending the money for their service.

Good Luck!!!
