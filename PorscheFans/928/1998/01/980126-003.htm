Hi Piet,

When reaching speeds over 110 mph, a message appears saying that
the tire pressure on the rear left is.



As far as I know, the 2 pressure sensors in each wheel are very
sensitive.  If I remember correctly, they already activate with a
pressure loss of only 0.15 bar difference.  Anyway it may be as simple
as a bad sensor in one of your wheels.  Use the procedure mentioned in
the usersmanual, when you get one, to check if one of them is broken.
Is it the same wheel everytime?  Are you 100% sure that there is no
problem with one of the tires.  The air compressors and especially their
pressure meters at gas stations are very unreliable as I found myself.
They are abused by every motorist coming by and certainly not gauged nor
verified ever.  I experienced a difference of 0.75 bar between the
reading at one gas station and the other.  This difference was not due
to heating up the tires because of driving.  Therefore check and make
sure.

I would not recommend disconnecting them though as Kevin suggested,
unless they are a real pain in the ass these sensors.  They are a mighty
good feature and a good early warning system.  Especially if you're
going to go to Germany regularly.  Think, or maybe rather not, of what
would happen in a situation with to low a tire pressure at 110 mph.  RIP
Piet!!!!!   It was nice knowing you ;-);-);-);-);-);-);-);-);-);-);-);-)

Regarding you're day counter, press the button next to the dimmer switch
for 2 seconds ore more.  This is the same button to activate /
deactivate the timer  Hey presto, daycounter to zero.

Contact PON in Amersfoort, they'll probably be able to get you a users
manual or a copy of it.  My experiences with them so far are them to be
extremely helpfull when asked nicely.

Good luck with your car.

  I have is significant problem with AC units because I store the car during
the winter.  Cleveland (A salt mine is under Lake Erie so that the city
fathers have to keep the saft miners employed) is very hard on car during the
winter because the temperatures are 20-40F with rain, ice and snow mixed with
salt.  I store the car in a "CARBAG".  The bag is dryed (put in drying agent)
and sealed.  The car is set for the winter.  I have stored a 69 911S for years
using this method. But the 928 has an AC so that the AC lub system dries out
and the unit locks up.  The 928 is hot even in Cleveland so that I end up
replacing the AC before its time.

 Does anyone have a idea how to save the AC unit without taking the car out
and running the unit.

  Regards
  Walt Chapman
