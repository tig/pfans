Jim,
Keep in mind, I never checked my voltage with a external voltmeter,
so I was just commenting on what my dash voltmeter reads.  I'll
be glad to check it so you can compare, but won't be able to get to
it until the weekend.

I purchased the rebuilt from Automotion as opposed to 928Intl or
Devek because they had a good price and a good warrantee.  That
was over a year ago, you may want to do another comparison.
