To John White....

Other than personal experience, is there any published info that states that
the hatch release only works with the doors open?  (the owner's manual doesn't
say a word about this).  Even my dealer wasn't sure...they said that they
"thought" it only worked with the door open.

And I swear that my hatch releases with the doors closed...but not all the
time.  And when it won't release, I open the door, pull the release, and
bingo, hatch open.

Very curious behavior, indeed.


Re: 928 Brochures.....

Walter Miller does provide just about any brochure you can think of (not just
Porsche).  I've purchased an 87 Porsche brochure, 89 Jag XJS, and several
motorcycle brochures from him, all in perfect condition.  He advertises
heavily in Hemmings, in just about every section.  Good source (and
inexpensive since he has no personal interest in the brochures, apart from
selling them).

Aerodynamics & Weight....

There always seems to be some controversy over literal interpretation of posts
on this list.  I think that when "tarollins" said that weight and aerodynamics
were related, he didn't mean aerodynamics itself was related to weight, but
rather that the effect of aerodynamics was related...which it certainly is.
Weight counteracts the lift force (if any).  Therefore more weight equals more
traction, given equal aerodynamics.  Of course it is also true that
aerodynamics itself is not related to weight, as stated by several individual
posts to this list.
