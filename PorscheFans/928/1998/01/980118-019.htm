Go for it!

That's why you should do it, and it's remarkable how many little (and
sometimes not so little) opportunities there are in real-world traffic
situations to experience that excitement.

Fine, but cost per mile should actually drop, since you won't be dealing
with seals, batteries, hoses, belts, etc. which get tired and die over time
even if the car sits.

>Can someone please tell me the problems they have had with everyday 928 use.

1. Finding secure places to park
2. Dealing with the fact that sometimes it rains and the car gets dirty

That's it. 

>I am also worried about stop and go driving on my 5 Speed.

Every now and then, I need to crawl (literal stop and start every 10-20
feet) five or ten miles along one of NYC's finest highways. When you do
this, you quickly learn a throttle-and-clutch technique which minimizes
stress to the clutch.

I've come to feel that dealer service departments must get some sort of
commission or kickback from new car sales, because they're so often heard
telling stories about why perfectly healthy cars "of an age" (usually
anything out of warranty) are no longer maintainable. I personally wouldn't
take any car of mine to a dealer except for warranty service, or to keep
the warranty in force. After that, it's independents for me.

>(Provided that I didn't opt for a used clutch)

Which you can do; there are plenty of services who will put new friction
material on a pressure plate, though you still need to renew the throwout
bearing and (eventually) the springs.

>Is he blowing smoke or did Porsche stop making the clutch for a '88 s4?

Sachs, who make the clutches in our cars for Porsche and sell both through
dealers and numerous independent parts houses, will be surprised to hear
this news. It also appears to be the case that the GTS clutch will go into
S4s (something I'm considering in view of power increases and chronic lead
foot syndrome).

>P.S. Does anyone know of a good 928 technician in Northern Virginia?

This question has arisen and been answered on the list, so expect to hear
from some of the NoVa contingent.
