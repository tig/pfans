Why should it be illegal? We have too many laws already. FWIW I cut a 
CDROM before Christmas that I don't intend to make available to the 
public either. CD-R's sure are nice.

As cheap as CDROMs are to make (blank CD-R's are approaching $1.00 in
100's) that AOL, Compuserve, and others mail millions unsolicited
attempting to generate business, Porsche should do the same with their
service manuals. The more widely available the service manuals are, the
more likely they are to sell parts. And the better kept older Porsches
are the better their resale value. The better the resale value of used
Porsches the higher they can keep new Porsche prices.

Once they've bothered to write the manual it costs almost nothing to
produce the 2nd copy.

Would be *very* disappointed if Porsche releases a CDROM that is 
Windows-only. There is no excuse for such stupidity with Adobe Acrobat 
and/or html. Make mine Unix and Macintosh.

I was really impressed in 1993 to learn Infiniti included the service 
manual in the trunk of every car. That's such a fine idea I bought one 
myself.
