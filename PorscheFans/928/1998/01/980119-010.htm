Dave, I think you've started something...

My best Porsche story has to do with meeting Shaquille O'Neal.  I was in
Baton Rouge, Louisiana working on a project in 93 or 94.  Shaq was taking
some classes at LSU during the off season to finish his degree.  One
morning, a friend of mine asked for a ride to campus.  After dropping him
off, I noticed two guys walking across the parking lot in front of me.  One
was pretty tall, and the other was pointing at my car, a dark metallic grey
86 928S 32V, with an S4 wing, chrome-plated AZEV 17-inch wheels, tinted
windows -- VERY sharp.  As I got closer, I recognized the tall man as
Shaquille O'Neal.  I stopped the car and got out, approached Mr. O'Neal, and
said, "Hi, I know you're on your way to class.  I just wanted to meet you.
My name is Tony Golden."  He shook my hand and said, "Nice to meet you.  I'm
Shaquille O'Neal."  I said, "Yeah, I know. Nice to meet you."  Then I got
back in my car and left.  Later that evening, I was telling my friend about
the incident and he said sometimes Shaq comes to the gym in the evenings
when they're playing basketball.  A few days later, my friend was at the gym
and Shaq came in.  After the initial crowd dissipated, my friend walked up
to Shaq and introduced himself.  He then said, "Hey, a buddy of mine said he
met you the other day."  Shaq said, "Oh yeah?  What's his name?"  My friend
said, "Tony Golden"  Shaq pondered a moment, then said, "Hmmm... Tony
Golden....  gray Porsche -- right?"  "That's him!" my friend said.

The "moral" to this story is that if I had driven a Chevy (or a Ford) Shaq
probably wouldn't have remembered me :)

Shalom, 'Ya All...

I'd like to add my personal observations and perhaps ask some long-needed-to-
be-answered questions after several years of  '85 928S ownership:

a. For some reason, I've always kept the tow eye screwed in place. It real
purpose was made clear after I was rear-ended by a couple of strippers on
thier way to work while putting on makeup in the rear view. Their Honda Accord
hit me dead center at about 10mph. With the tow eye in place, it punched an
eliptical hole in the Honda's front end coming to rest IN it's radiator while
doing nothing more than slightly collapsing my right bumper shock...!

b. If you drive an AT 928, run don't walk to the nearest shop and replace your
ATF with B&M High Performance ATF. The stuff is like absolute MAGIC...! Your
tranny will run cooler and slick 'as crab crap on a rainy day.

c. I'll be installing DEVEK headers this spring and I'd like to hear from
anyone who is currently using them for your observations. Also, has anyone
installed a custom headers back exhaust system...? or junked the resonator
muffler..? Are there any performance benefits to be gleaned by using a pair of
better glasspaks
and terminating in straight pipes out the ass end...?

d. Has anyone figured out a way to "free wheel" the smog pump ?  Is there a
benefit to converting to just the electric fan, thus disabling the belt driven
fan ?
Is there benefit to be gained from moving the air intake ducts from underhood
to hood mounted...? 

Thank you all for your kind assist and some very interesting reading...

Hello all,

I have never felt that my 81 S ran quite the way it should...yesterday I threw
it up on the rack and was amazed at the way the shop that did the EPA
conversion used this mickey mouse tiny converter that was only 1 7/8 on one
side, and 2" on the other.  They had both pipes from the engine Y'd into this,
and then a Y back out to the factory twin pipes.  I am amazed that it ran as
well as it did.  I have temporarily re-run twin pipes to the original exhaust,
until I can find a suitable cat , which I am looking for at the moment.  Wow.
Is this a happy car.  I had always been disappointed that it didnt feel
anywhere as strong as the 85 I once owned.  That's no longer the case.  This
puppy flat screams.  Biggest problem now is driving without wanting to plant
my foot in it everytime I leave the light.  I can see new tires in the near
future......
Anyway, what I wanted to ask before I got all fired up thinking about my cars
new performance, is how many other "gray-market" cars got this crappy
conversion?  And what kinds of solutions have any of you come up with that
still comply with the required EPA specifications, and still perform as
intended by the maker? ( some german company of unknown name, since I was told
by my Porsche dealer here that THEY dont claim my car...another story )
Thanks! ( I love this car....)
