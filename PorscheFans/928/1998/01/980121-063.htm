Matt:

You bring up a separate but great subject that everybody needs to know but
few want to face-- How to get pulled over and survive.

Your point about rolling the windows down is very good.  Spotlights on
patrol cars get focused on the side mirrors to illuminate the inside of the
car.  Tinted windows increase the officers nervousness, since the inside is
still dark.  Roll down the windows and turn on the interior lights if you
really want to make his day.  He definitely won't notice the tint, and his
attitude is likely to be much better.

It also helps that it wasn't  --your-- Datsun 240Z that hit-and-run'd that
little kid in the crosswalk at over 100... 


There's a whole list of things that keep the officer in a good mood when you
get pulled over.  As many will undoubtedly testify,  sometimes it works and
sometimes it doesn't.  You are just improving the odds a bit.

<<What is up with that.  Is there some

back lighting that gave out or is it something else?  None of the analog

gauges have been affected in any way (brightness or perceived correctness of

readings).



Help...this is frustrating to look at...I know it is just a little thing, but

I am a stickler for little things.>>  

This is probably due to a backlighting bulb burning out on one side.  Just a
guess.  It may not be convenient to check it out, though.  

By the way, as with me, your email address does not show up on your posts.
Other people have noticed and commented on the same thing.  I haven't seen any
answers as to why this happens.   Does anyone know?
