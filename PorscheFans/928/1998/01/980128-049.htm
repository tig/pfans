Hi all:  
I've got a Blaupunkt Monterey SQR 23 out of my '85 S, and I'd like to
sell or trade for a pair of straight, uncurbed rear 8 x 16 slotted
"S/S4" wheels.  The front and rear 7 x 16's on the right side are
curbed, so I thought I'd shift the good left/rear 7 over to the
front/right and find two rear 8's so I can run 245's.  Am I correct in
assuming that there are no differences in offset between front and rear
7's on the original "S" slots;  they are interchangable from front to
back, aren't they?  On the '85 S rear end, will the 8's require any
differing spacers or wheel bolts?  

With all this disparaging talk about Blaupunkt radios, I should tell you
that the only reason the Blau is out is because I installed a Pioneer
DEH-425 CD player.  The Blau works perfectly, and has been sitting
carefully shrink-wrapped in a closet for two years.

Email me directly if you want at: djorgens@telusplanet.net, or phone me
at 403.986.4389 after 6:00PM MST

Thanks,
Dave Jorgensen

If anyone is interested I found these at a publication place. If you want the
number I'll give it out, there is also an email address. For anyone who has an
89 S4, I recommend the deluxe brochure, I have it and it is a must for 89 s4
owners. I'm not affiliated with any of this by the way.
