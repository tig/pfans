Whoa, hoss! You're seeing the details of people learning to maintain and
repair their own cars (some of which have been in many uncaring hands),
often without benefit of proper documentation or tools. if you look at,
e.g., the BMW or Acura NSX lists, you'll see far more pain, immobilization,
and expense. By the standards of high-performance cars in general, 928s are
VERY reliable provided only that they are properly maintained. The biggest
problem with the "properly" part is finding truly knowledgeable service
technicians.

Fabulously wonderfully terrifically good! I got my car for sport and found
it to do that very well, but also to be a hugely comfortable and reliable
long-distance cruiser. It has become the car of choice around here for any
trip, unless there are too many people or objects to fit.

>How are 928s in the rain/snow/ice?

I just posted to the list a response to someone asking specifically about
snow. These are very powerful cars and can easily overcome available
traction on wet roads no matter how good the tires (and they really benefit
from using the best tires). The same applies more strongly on snow and ice.
However, particularly with an automatic, you can apply power smoothly and
get fine results. If you should slip, the car is easy to get back in line.

>How reliable is the automatic transmission over time?

These are Mercedes-Benz transmissions, built to last.

Yes. Parts continue to be available from Porsche, and the aftermarket is
just waking up to the fact that there are a lot of 928s out there. These
cars are built for the long run and, again with proper maintenance, should
last indefinitely. Porsche's anti-corrosion program is very effective; rust
is rarely seen, let alone an issue, on these cars.

You've come to the right place!
