I recently purchases a 1989 928S4 with 45,000 miles on the odometer and =
while cruising it died on me.  It has been in the shop for 3 weeks now =
and the diagnosis is a bad fuel control brain box. I searched high and =
low and quickly realized brain boxes unless purchased directly from =
Porsche ($1,575) are very difficult to find. Although, there are rebuilt =
ones for 88 models and earlier there aren't any for the 89 and later =
models. My question is; has any body else experienced this problem or =
can shed some light on obtaining rebuilt brain boxes?
