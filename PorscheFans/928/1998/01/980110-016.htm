Yikes! you wanna give me nightmares?  When I was a teen I would swap the =
battery out of my Pontiac GP into my Volvo 245 DL while they were =
running and never had a problem of course I would never do that with my =
928.  Sorry to hear about the 911 but it could have been worst the whole =
thing,  never mind I would rather not think about it.  Any way Hi every =
one! I haven't had a chance to read a post in over a month,  did I miss =
anything ground breaking?  Does anyone know where I can get a luggage =
cover for a reasonable price?  Thanks,  Later :)
