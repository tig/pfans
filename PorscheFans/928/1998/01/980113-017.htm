Hi all,
        I was wondering if anyone has any thought's on the best way too
Improve 928 breaking. I am thinking of buying cross-drilled rotor's on
front and rear with stainless steel brake lines. I am concerned about
the 928's brakes because while proving the 928's performance against a
Corvette (nice way of saying racing) I broke a front brake pad into two
piece's. I was driving the car extremely hard (the passenger swears we
hit 260 km/160mph) and was breaking hard coming into traffic (to
120kms/75mph) and after that I heard grinding coming from the front
brakes. Has this happened to anyone else? (I mean the brakes not the
vette :) 

Thanks,
J.Brown

PS The 928 did win and I did see the same Vette later at a mall and the
guy asked me what I had done to "hop-up" my car and when I said it's
stock exempt for the K&N filter his mouth dropped open because he said
he's spent 10 grand to fix up his Vette :)
