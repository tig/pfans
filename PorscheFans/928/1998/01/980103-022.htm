Humm, I wonder if it could be a bad CV joint.  Does the noise come from
both side?Do they feel "loose" if you try to shake the half shaft?

Just a thought...

Hi,
I have had the non or part time odometer problem on two or three VDO
instrumented cars, Audi, VW & MB I think. Probably because I only drive older
cars. My problem was a plastic (nylon?) gear, about 1/2 inch in diameter, that
is pressed on the shaft that turns the odometer cylinders. Over time and
baking in the sun, the gear shrinks and develops a small crack at the hub. The
gear then slips on the shaft instead of turning it. This was on VDO units
driven by a speedometer cable. I don't know how the electronic
speedometer/odometer units operate. The odometer part may be similar. You've
got to take it out anyway so have a look.

The solution I used was to clean the gear and shaft with degreasing solvent.
It's tough due to limited space. Use a foam Q tip like you would use for tape
head cleaning. I mixed a small amount of JB Weld epoxy and carefully applied
it to the gear hub/shaft end. Don't let the JB Weld sag into the works! Let it
cure and re-assemble. I never had any more odometer problems after the fix.  I
would suggest also cleaning and lubricating the odometer unit to be sure it
wasn't  stuck together with old grease.

It's really not to difficult to remove the pod to get the speedo out. Get a 27
mm socket,  4" extension, and long handle to remove the steering wheel, a long
5 mm allen wrench to undo 2 bolts (nearly hidden, near front outer edges of
the pod - underneath), and an 8 or 10 mm socket to undo 2 more bolts near the
turn signal switch unit and the pod is nearly free. This is after taking off
the shield under the pod held on with 2 phillips headed screws, and the turn
signal/light switch assembly. Careful to not pull the wires loose that go to
the instrument light dimmer and intermittent wiper delay control. Remove the
elecrtical plugs that go to the instrument cluster and work it free of the pod
starting from the right side (for left drive cars).

Hope this helps.
