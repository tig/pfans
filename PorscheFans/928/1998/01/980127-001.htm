Good real 928 mechanics are scarce, beware. Buy the newest, best
maintained car (with service records) you can afford.
Look at the Market report article Bruce Anderson wrote in the december
'97 issue of Excellence magazine.

intervals (60K) that need to be taken into consideration?  What is most
likely
to go wrong and how much do these items cost to repair or tune?

Timing belt needs to be kept an eye on, that can ruin the engine if
broken. Mechanically the cars are very strong if maintained well. Most
problems are electrical: connectors and such.

4. Value as it pertains to cost vs. performance: From what I can tell it
seems
as though the 88-89 S4 seems to be "breakpoint".  90s and later years
seem to
jump quite dramatically in price without a "huge" jump in performance.
Any
inside information you could graciously pass along to a newbie?

90s and later are very low cost vs. performance even GTS's, earlier cars
are extreemly unbelievable fabulously low cost vs. performance!

Let us hear what you encounter.
