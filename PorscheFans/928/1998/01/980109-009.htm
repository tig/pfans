	[snip]
	Things to check for:
	. the voltmeter itself is miscalibrated
	. oxidation buildup on the pcb connectors to the instrumentation
cluster
	. you actually have a low voltage condition.  when was the last
time you've check the battery?

	On the lighter socket having no power.  First I would check the
fuse.  Second, check the hot lead going to the lighter socket.  Chances
are that it came off by accident when someone mucked with the center
console at one point in time.  For example, installing a new stereo
system.

	About the spike when you shift.  Its probably caused by the
reverse light being on when you shift.

	 I've also noticed on ocasion that when I shift is when the
	needle spikes.  I also noticed that my lighter did not power my
cellphone
	when I tried to use it a couple of days ago.  I don't smoke so
that was the
	first time I tried using the lighter and it didn't work.  Do you
think it's
	a short?  Or is there some kind of electrical connection between
the
	shifter and the voltmeter or instrument pod. Mine is an AT.
Just one more
	fact to throw into the fray.
