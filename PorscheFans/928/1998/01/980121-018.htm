Hey Tom!!!

After your done with this job, taking the exhaust system off will seem like
a walk in the park.  And really it is.  9 bolts, O2 sensor, disconnect air
pump pipe, undo the hangers and its out-o-there.

I have a 1986 S and don't know if our trannies are the same, doubt it.  I
didn't see any need for the alignment tool.  You MUST get an alignment after
everything is back in place, but other than that, there isn't much room for
anything to be out of wack under there.  But, you will need a helping hand
to marry everything up again, it is not a one person job, with or without
the tool.  I didn't use any special tools when I replaced my T/Tube and
everything is working great!!!  Don't know if your T/tube is in good shape
or not, but you might want to consider replacing it while you have it all
apart anyway.

Will you be doing this in a home garage without a lift?  if so, get ready
for back pain!!!
Get the car as safely high as you possible can.  There is not a lot of room
under there and if you are claustrophobic, your out.

My advice:
- Take your time and be patient.  You not dealing with a $50 tranny that you
can get down at the local junk yard.  If you break something major while
doing this job, it is going to cost you BIG!!!
- have a good system in place that allows you to raise and lower the tranny
independently of the car.  Be careful about the amount that you raise and
lower the tranny while it is hooked to the T/tube, puts a lot of pressure on
the aluminum engine bell housing.
- disconnect everything from the tranny, except transmission lines for
cooling to the front.  Unless you plan to put the tranny on a beach to do
the seals.  Those lines give you a good 1.5 ft of vertical movement under
the car.
* - the wires that go to the Speedo are hard to find from underneath, take
your spare out to find them before you drop the tranny, unless you like to
soder.
* - be careful removing the shifting linkage.  There is a plastic/electronic
piece behind the linkage that tells the computer what gear your in and also
is a neutral switch.  The plastic arm on this piece that moves with the
linkage is very brittle.  I broke mine and had to wait a 5 days to get a new
one, only $80, but it stopped the car dead in its tracks.

Be ready to find new and interesting things when you get under there.  I
started out with a torque tube replacement job that turned into new rear
shocks, new steering rack, new rotars/pads(all around) would have done more,
but the budget was expended.  But, it was a heck of a lot of fun and my car
drives ABSOLUTELY GREAT because of the work!!!  Not a bad way to spend a
week off.


Good Luck!!!

Well...,
I just got my new set of Workshop manuals last week and am getting
geared up for my "winter project".  I'm going to be removing my auto
transmission to replace the front seal(s), which are leaking.
I'd like to hear from anyone who's done this, as far as things to
watch out for, tips, tricks, etc.  Also, any ideas on what else I
should do while it's out?
The manual (Volume III, sec. 38, pg 149) shows some special tools
needed to re-align things after replacing the seals.  Anyone know if
these are really necessary?  Or can it be done without them?  Does
anyone have these tools that I could rent/borrow?
Thanks for any help.  1st step - remove the exhaust system :-(

<<I've got an '86 S (32V) and have a small oil leak from the hose which 

connects to the forward portion of the right cylinder head cover.  I 

have never been under the intake air distributer so I don't know where 

this hose leads.  Since oil leaking here is flowing onto my hot headers, 

II need to fix this before spring thaw.....



I have two questions:



1. Can anyone tell me the purpose of this hose, and where the other end 

of it resides?  I cannot find it in the manuals anywhere, only a listing 

of the connector stub on the diagram of the cylinder head cover.  



2. Also, how is the connector stub fastened to the cover?  Is is pressed 

in?  If I want to replace the "O" ring, can I do it without removing the 

cover?



BTW... this is a great list and a wonderful resource for us who have 

discovered the pleasures of this fine machine.  



Thanks in advance......>>

Ed Ruiz pointed out this hose on my car as a possible culprit.  I am curious
where the oil is accumulating on your car, is it traveling all the way to the
undercarriage?  I find that accumulation only after sustained high RPM
cruising.  Let me know what your experience has been.  I have also seen a
fitting in the center of the cylinder banks starting to leak a small amount of
oil.  It is to the left of center, and has an electrical connection on it.
Does anyone know what this might be, since I know it isn't the pressure
sender.  

Ed should be able to describe what the hose is and what functions it performs.
Along with the other details of your post, as I seem to remember he replaced
his.
