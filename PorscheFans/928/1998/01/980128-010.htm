Our air intake is very close to the hood of the car. The chance
of taking a lot of water is thus minimal.  However, if you go through
a deep puddle, I was once told to keep it in low gear to keep the
revs up.  This would insure a healty exhaust flow preventing
water to go into the muffle and even catalyst.

I am not sure of the validity of this trick but it has some merit
to it.

Oh, happy to hear about the starter fix!!
