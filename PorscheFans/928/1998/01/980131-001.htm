We really need a search engine for the archives!  As time goes on the
details of this mod get a little fuzzy so you should contact Mark
Anderson at 928 International to verify procedures (and that's one
expensive control brain you're messing with so you better be diligent). 
That said I take no responsibility or offer any warranty for these
procedures, ok?  In other words, you broke it you buy it...

What you need to do is locate the RDK brain.  On my '90 GT it resides
under the dash, just above the clutch pedal.

Dismount said brain.

Undo the amphenol connector.

Open the brain up (bend open tabs).

Get a short length of wire, strip and tin the ends.

Bridge pin 2 to pin 13 (or was it 14 - see, get a hold of Mark.  I will
try to open my controller this weekend and verifyp pins and brain part
number).  Remember careful!  Too much heat or one errant drop of solder
and you're screwed!

Reassemble and test drive (remember you are not on a race course) all
should be well with no effect to ABS, PSD, etc. just remember to check
your tire pressures periodically...

Good luck YMMV,
Phil Tong
