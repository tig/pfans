Just purchased a set of factory manuals from PO for $100.00. I'm wondering
if I have the entire set. I have 6 volumes and it appears that they cover up
to model year '85. I know the sets available now are 9 volumes so am I just
missing '86-'95? 

My $.02 about Blaus: I installed a Blau model Los Angeles to replace
original Blau. Could not have been an easier install, looks great, has great
FM reception and CD sound. Bought it new at Best Buy for under $200.00. This
unit pulls in signals that my '95 Chevy truck's factory stereo can't touch.
I'm not saying it's the BEST available but worth the $200.00 and a breeze to
install.

One last quick question: Weather has been bad so getting the shark out has
been hit and miss lately. It starts immediately when cold and sitting for a
couple of weeks, but lately, after it has warmed up and been driven a while
it doesn't want to start. It turns over fine and I can finally get it
started after 4-5 minutes of turning it over. Seems like if it was a low
battery problem the symptoms would be reversed? Any suggestions would be
helpful.

Thanks in advance,
Tom Wiegand
