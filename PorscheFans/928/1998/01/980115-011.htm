Hey Mike!!!

Our friends at www.928intl.com have a carbon fiber replacement for around
$150.  I am not sure if it is patterned after the early 928 shifters or the
later, but being carbon fiber, I would hope that they used the later design.

As far as the 944 shifter compatibility, No such luck!!!

Even the guys at my local Porsche dealer thought that the $450 for the
shifter was a little ridiculous!!!  I think that it is a lot ridiculous!!!

www.928intl.com is the only place where I have looked for a new handle, you
might want to try other aftermarket Porsche part dealers

Peace
