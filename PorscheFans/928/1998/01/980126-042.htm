    Brian:

    There are a number of reasons commonly cited... Here are a few:

    1.  From "Return of the Straight Dope", by Cecil Adams:

            It has to do with drey-wagons in the 1700s.  The US and
            France, having lots of space, took to using big wagons
            to haul products from farm to city.  These big wagons
            lacked a driver's seat so the driver sat on the left rear
            horse of his team. Sitting on the left, you want to pass
            on the left so you can see the other fellow's wheels as
            you passed. Hence, you drive on the right.  

            In England (small surface area), wagons were smaller,
            with a wide seat in the center.  Drivers usually sat on
            the right side of the seat so as to more efficiently flog
            their team (most people flog with their right hand).  In
            logical progression, they wound up driving on the right.

    2.  From "The Rule of the Road: An International Guide to
        History and Practice", by Peter Kincaid (ISBN 0-313-25249-1):

            Different types of transport, all used by right-handed
            people, tended to produce different rules of the road.
            Armed walkers and armed horsemen tended to keep left to
            leave their swordarms free. Horse riders kept left in any
            case because they mounted from the left and stayed near
            the edge where it was easier and safer to mount and
            dismount than in the middle of the road.  People leading
            horses with their right hands tended to keep right
            because the led horse was then protected from passing
            traffic.  Carters tended to keep right because they
            walked on the left side of their horses, leading with the
            right hand, and by keeping right could walk in the
            middle of the road...to avoid collisions. Postilion
            riders tended to keep right because they sat on the
            left-rear horse and thus could better judge
            clearances....Drivers who sat on the vehicle kept left
            because they sat on the right to keep their whip hands
            free and could judge clearances better when passing if
            they kept left."

            There are other contributing factors such as conformance
            with neighbors, influence of colonization, national
            unity, imported vehicles, etc.  Although we tend to think
            of a keep-left rule requiring right-hand controls, and
            vice versa, there are a number of instances where
            curbside controls have been preferred to centerline
            controls.

    3.  From an unknown but apparently popular source:

            The side of the road that one presently drives on has to
            do with which was your "sword" arm, and therefore whether
            you were in the right position to deliver a mighty whack
            to the oncoming horseman.  Supposedly, Napoleon decided
            that areas under his command were entering a new age of
            peace, and as a symbol of that, everyone was commanded to
            change sides. Of course, Great Britain and all of its
            various holdings kept things just as they always have
            been... Except that we in the Colonies switched in order
            to differentiate ourselves  from the hated British.

    The American expert on this subject is Richard H. Hopper, whose
    article "Left-Right: Why Driving Rules Differ," appeared in
    Transportation Quarterly 36 (1982), pp. 541-548.

    If you'd like to see exactly which countries drive on the left
    and which drive on the right, point your web browser at:

        http://www.travel-library.com/general/driving
        /drive_which_side.html

    Of course, that's just a single URL... I split it into two lines
    only because it doesn't fit on a single line.

    "Song of the South" was never released in the USA, but Disney
    DID release it on laserdisc in Japan.  The laserdisc is
    currently out of print, but you may be able to rent it or
    something.
