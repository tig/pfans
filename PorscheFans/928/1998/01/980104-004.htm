It appears that my mechanical fan (83S, auto, A/C, for those keeping 
score) is going away fast...the bearings are toast & the fan shaft 
may be damaged as well. It got me thinking about how replacing it 
with a large electric fan might be the way to go, considering the 
$300+ it'd take to replace the whole unit, along with the other 
benefits of an electric fan.. 
If anyone here has done this, could you share your experiences? 
I'm wondering if I'll have a problem finding one beefy enough & 
where I'll put the temp sensor (oh lord, not ANOTHER one..).

Hi Kurt and Leonard,

I too have previously pondered the points mentioned in this thread.
The manual says that if a wheel is removed, the wheel stud NEXT to the valve
stem should first be marked with red paint. (this red stud receives the wheel
lock.) 
An exception is the 17" Cup Design Wheel, where the wheel stud OPPOSITE the
valve stem is red-marked. (this red stud also receives the wheel lock)
The manual then says "this is to ensure that the wheel is fitted in the same
position relative to the wheel  hub or brake disk."  (This leads one to think
that there was originally a set wheel to hub relationship.)
I red-painted my studs about 5 years ago. Three of the hubs had faint red
paint on one stud and the fourth did not. So I just painted it as prescribed
above. I was wondering if the factory marked them originally, or if there was
a way to tell the original wheel to hub orientation. Since it originally
apparently had a set relationship between the hub and wheel, you would think
there'd be a permanent stamped mark or some sure identifier, so that this
relationship would never be lost. 
I also don't understand why the 17" Cup Design Wheel would have a different
valve stem / wheel lock orientation, unless the wheel locks are a different
weight than the the other wheel types.

>Of course, then you'd want to mount the wheels with the locks

This is incorrect according to what the manual says. 
(unless of course you have the 17" Cup Design Wheels)

I don't understand it either, but apparently Porsche thinks it matters which
way the wheel is oriented.

Leonard, I agree that wheel locks (as I recall) are heavier than the wheel
nuts, and although having the wheel lock and the valve stem on the same side
(as in the 17" Cup Design Wheel) would certainly make that side heavier, the
manual seems to turn a blind eye to this aspect, focusing on the wheel to hub
orientation, but, with no mention as to why exactly. (also, no mention of what
the heck to do if you have aftermarket wheels!) 

>The reason must be that the valve stem flexes at high speed creating an

But they are supposed to be on the same side, so says the manual.
Kurt, the ol' valve stem g-force theory sounds plausible, but I'm not sure if
I'm convinced of its effect. Does this mean that if you have the groovy valve
stem supports and the valve stems are basically stationary, then this is not a
problem?

All this kinda makes me wonder if any 928 (after several tire changes) still
has the original wheel / hub relationship. 
Speaking of tires, it also must be noted that the dot on the tire (usually
green, yellow, or white) must be aligned to the high spot on the rim which is
identified by a milled recess on the inside of the rim. (I put another small
red paint dot on my rim to mark this spot also.) This is also talked about
briefly in the manual. This is called "controlled matching" of the tire and
wheel.
Of course, to eliminate heavy balance weighting, the tire may still need to be
rotated on the rim to get a better balance without the heavy balance weights.

Then manual really gets weird when it says that when you mount the wheels, you
are supposed to rotate the valve so that it is in the upper posistion, or, in
the case of the 17" Cup Design Wheels, in the lower posistion, before the
wheel is tightened on the wheel hub. It says that this prevents the optimum
balancing effect that was obtained by balancing, from being lost.

My goodness fellas, you about have to be a "physicist" to mount wheels on
these cars, don't ya?   :)   

Let's see.....read 16 pages of how to mount tires and wheels, tell your tire
guy all about it, (get laughed at) have the wheels impacted on at about 10,000
ft.lbs. by his "knowledgeable 928 technician", drive car.....vibration at
80mph.....dang!.....
call Leonard......"oh please could you come over and mount my tires and wheels
for me?"
    
Apologies for the long post,
Regards,
Greg Schickel
