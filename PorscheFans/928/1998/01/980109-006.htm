Hey!!!  A new twist to the question about fluctuating voltmeters. =

Yesterday when I put the key in the car and turned it to the accessories
position,  the voltmeter did not move.  I started the car and it started
but then as I was backing out of my parking spot,  I noticed the voltmete=
r
drop to 10 slowly and the engine start to die,  I quickly shifted into
neutral and then into park and the voltmeter went back to 13.  This jogge=
d
my memory and I've noticed that the reason I've always put the key to
accessories first before engaging the starter was to see the voltmeter
needle move. I've also noticed on occassion that when I shift is when the=

needle spikes.  I also noticed that my lighter did not power my cellphone=

when I tried to use it a couple of days ago.  I don't smoke so that was t=
he
first time I tried using the lighter and it didn't work.  Do you think it=
's
a short?  Or is there some kind of electrical connection between the
shifter and the voltmeter or instrument pod. Mine is an AT.  Just one mor=
e
fact to throw into the fray.
