Gang,

	Actually Blau sorta does deserve its current reputation, but here is
why. Seems a number of years ago we (us here in the states) stopped
getting Blau's that were designed and made in germany. We were (and
still are) getting stuff that was made in the asian marketplace. And
those units just were not up to the original equipment from Blau.

	Now, with the 7 series radios they are designed and manufactured in
germany at there factory. Quality does seem to be much higher than
before. It was for this reason that I gave a final nod to the Blau 7
Series "Sydney" radio/tape unit that I just installed in my SEC. When it
came right down to it the upper Sony units *DO* have a bit better specs
than this model does, but could I really tell in a car while driving
down the road? And I just could not get past the face layout and color
scheme of the sony's. While cosmetics was not the major criteria for my
decision, the blau does look much better in the car than the sony would.
Also, this model uses a security card the size of a credit card instead
of a removeable face plate. Much easier to carry around with you. Also,
I got the radio for $284, a long way from the list price of $399, and
actually a bit cheaper than the top sony models. Continental Imports
(they have a web site) offers pretty good pricing and that is where I
got this from.

	Anyway, those are my thoughts on the issue. I have only had the radio
in since christmas so I do not have a long term reliability report but
we will see. If the thing bites the dust I will mention it.

	Now, the legal stuff: I do not sell radios and have no affiliation w/
blau or continental imports.

take care,
david cole
