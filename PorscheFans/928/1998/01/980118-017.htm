Here's a interesting situation I encountered.
I wanted my mechanic to drop my front end 1" to
match the rear via spring perch adjustment or via
new springs.
Well apparently, the car does not have adjustable
spring perches in the front.
In the rear, yes. Anyhow, I ordered some from
Automotion, but apparently the front struts would
not thread into the new perches, as the thread
diameter differed. Thus new struts would be needed
as well. So has anyone dealt with this type of
problem before, and what are the "Green" struts? I
didn't see them listed in the previous posts.

I am considering turning my '88 928s4 5 Speed into my everyday car.  There is
no question that I would prefer to include the 928 driving excitement into my
everyday routine, however I am concerned about increased maintenance costs
because of 
the increased mileage.  

Can someone please tell me the problems they have had with everyday 928 use.

I am also worried about stop and go driving on my 5 Speed.   I spoke with a
service advisor at a Porsche dealership this week and he said that I should
take care of my clutch because Porsche does not make the '88 clutch anymore
and I would require motifications to the transmission if it goes out.
(Provided that I didn't opt for a used clutch)  Is he blowing smoke or did
Porsche stop making the clutch for a '88 s4?

P.S. Does anyone know of a good 928 technician in Northern Virginia?
