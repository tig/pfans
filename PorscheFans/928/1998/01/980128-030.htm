Ferenc:

I guess if you wanted lighter steering you should have purchased my Europa.
<grin>

The 928 seemed heavy to me too, especially after driving the Lotus' cars for
many years.  I can tell you that you'll get used to it, and learn to
appreciate this as you do the other features of the car.

My Opinion:

The steering assist is somewhat heavy for around-town driving.  Without some
form of variable assist system, the amount of boost that's ideal for
high-speed touring seems insufficient for slow-speed maneuvering.  So be it.
To make sure you are getting at least the best possible effect from what you
have,  make sure the tires are good,  round and worn evenly, and also
inflated correctly.  One reader here suggested a few months ago that he sees
better front tire wear with 40psig.  I tried it and it seems to make the
steering feel a bit lighter at low speeds.

Don't bother taking stuff out of the car trying to make it lighter. Removing
the sound insulation from the inside of the hood exposes the paint to engine
heat.  You might save a couple pounds of weight,  but you'll pay for it with
mottled paint within a short time.

Driving with the windows down in the summer is OK going slow,  but the noise
is significant at higher speeds.  You'll appreciate having the AC installed
and working in the car, as opposed to sitting in a box under your bed.

The headlight adjusters might save a few lbs,  but you'll need to come up
with rigid links to replace the mechanicals.  Not worth it in my opinion.

The doors seem heavy, but contribute to the stiffness of the car when
closed. Taking out a few pounds of sound insulation will not make a
significant difference in weight.  When you look inside the door you'll see
that there isn't any loose stuff in there to take out anyway.  Stereo
speakers,  power window lifts and regulators, the door beam-- those are the
'heavy' parts.  Part of the feel of the door is due to it's length; The
inertial moment is a long way from the hinge pins.


Advice:

Don't do anything to the car until you've had a chance to drive and
appreciate it for a few months.  Some things take a little time to get used
to,  and the 'heavy' steering and the slow-speed engine response are high on
the list.  You'll find that you adjust your driving style to take advantage
of the car's strengths, and your enjoyment will continue to increase.


Enjoy your new ride!
