If the draw were way more than the alternator could produce, the
battery would be discharging.

Actually, it doesn't.  (Having never succeeded in getting away with
a violation, I am very mindful in my obedience to these laws.)

The main source of power into the alternator is mechanical,
i.e. the belt.  Can an alternator generate more power than is
consumed by its field coil?  Absolutely.  Otherwise, it wouldn't
be a very useful device for producing power.

Still, unless the voltage regulator is up to the more difficult
task of regulating the rectified AC output of an alternator in the
absence of a battery, I wouldn't try this on a car with electronics.
