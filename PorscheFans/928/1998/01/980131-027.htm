Sleu,

Be patient...don't settle for a 928 wait for the right one.  There was an '85
for sale at a Transmission or some kind of shop right off the highway up here
in Round Rock a few months ago, and when I took my GTS to the dealer to have
the tires changed I saw the car...

Here is the story:

The car had in white shoe polish $8900 on the window, I am not sure what it
sold for, and it looked pretty good from the road and under not to close
inspection.

The reality is that for what this guy needs to spend on the car I would have
sold him my S4 that is almost perfect.  I talked to the mechanic doing the
work on it and he said that the car drives very poorly, needs a new
transmission, and even after the $5k worth of work they are doing on it will
still have some various leaks.  He told the guy the best thing is to just
drive it and keep putting oil, trans and diff fluid in it as necessary and
just fix the things that have to be fixed to keep it running.  He told the guy
it is not worth fixing all that needs it because the car will never be worth
that kind of money.

The moral of the story is that you need to look a car over very carefully
before you buy it because rarely will you ever find a $5k 928 that needs less
than $5k worth of work done to it.  Or put another way you will rarely find a
person asking anything for a car when it is really worth several $k more.
Sometimes you get lucky like a friend here in town who bought a very nice
'88S4 for $15k that was in need of very little work.  He got that because the
owner went to a dealer to trade it in on another car and was offered $13k for
it.  Had he waited on it a bit he probably could have sold it out right to
someone else for closer to $18k.

Anyway, hang in there and you will find your dream car soon enough.  Let Brian
do some looking for you too.  You can never have to many eyes looking for you.

On another note from the dealer.  There is a RED/Black '89GT for sale.  The
same mechanic working on the '85 says it would be a good car to avoid.  Looks
like it has been driven hard and put up wet more than a few times.  It was hit
very hard left front and the repair job seems to have been good, but you never
know.  The drivers seat has a seam that is ripping out, and the rear A/C unit
is missing many of its small air diffusers (which you can't buy seperately and
put in).  There is no luggage cover and we know how much those little jewels
are (if you don't have the hardware you have to buy the whole thing from
Porsche; they only rebuild them if you supply your hardware).  The forged CS.
wheels have met the curb more than once.  It has a poorly mounted cell phone
(right on top of the arm rest).  Apparently there are some interesting dents
and bends in the chassis that you can see when you put it up on a lift (again
according to the mechanic) but I think the A/C works as the parts guys told me
the PO had spent much money with them on A/C stuff.  Anyway watch out for this
car.  May not be too bad if you can get it for about $17k but the sales guy
was thinking like $25k, I told him $19k-$21k max.  Oh, it has like 55k miles
on it and the last 6 digits of the vin are:  861123.

Good luck to all,
