Hi to all,
           I finally was able to take my shark in to see just how much
damage was done to the engine cover and the whole left side of the cover
is damaged, they had to fasten the left side with a piece of wire
because the fitting is broken. I talked to the owner and we agreed that
we will each pay 50% on a new used cover. I hope I didn't give out the
impression that I took my car to a gas station to have my oil changed
because I actually take my car to a mechanic who used to work for RUF
and I would take my car to the dealer if they didn't have the typical
attitude of leave your car here for two days and when we get around to
changing your oil we will call and let you know that you owe us 120$ for
a simple oil change.

Thanks,
J.Brown
