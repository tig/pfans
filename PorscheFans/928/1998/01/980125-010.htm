Gentlemen,

Subscribed to this list last week in preparation of "someday" buying one of
these fine "sharks".  My wife is now utterly tired of hearing my pleas for
purchase and my dreams, no longer about lovely young women, tend to revolve
around the 928! I know, I know…you have all been there!  Purchase is still a
year or more away but that won't stop the accumulation of knowledge…which is
the reason for this e-mail.

Couple of questions:

1. Have searched the net for a 1st time buyer's "things to look for list".
Have not found one except for a FAQ that simply said, "take it to a 928
mechanic".  That's nice and I will follow that superb advice but is there a
resource that outlines problems inherent to the 928?

2. I currently live in North Atlanta.  Is there a trustworthy person, shop, or
dealership that would help bring me up to speed concerning the intricacies of
this car?  Additionally, aside from the local paper is there a reliable point
of purchase in Atlanta?

3. Concerning maintenance:  I'm a handy guy with plugs, wire changes…simple
stuff.  Are there any "ball buster", from a cost standpoint, maintenance
intervals (60K) that need to be taken into consideration?  What is most likely
to go wrong and how much do these items cost to repair or tune?

4. Value as it pertains to cost vs. performance: From what I can tell it seems
as though the 88-89 S4 seems to be "breakpoint".  90s and later years seem to
jump quite dramatically in price without a "huge" jump in performance.  Any
inside information you could graciously pass along to a newbie?

5. If you had to do it all over again, what would you do differently prior to
purchase?

I certainly would appreciate any and all responses.  The 928 has been a dream
of mine since I was a teenager.  I'm now 30 and at a point where my income can
support the purchase and maintenance of this dream.  Previous experience with
sports cars has been nill and the only "performance oriented" purchases made
to date has been 3 Taurus SHOs (wonderful and reliable Yamaha engine but
lackluster reliability for the FORD portion of the car!).

Again, enjoyed reading the posts and thanks for the knowledge that you fine
folks have bestowed upon me.
