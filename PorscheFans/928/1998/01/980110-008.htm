a friend of mine with a '90 928 Auto. has changed his wheels from the stock
tire pressure sensing ones to wheels that do not have this option.  Is there a
way to prevent the system from indicating low pressure all the time.  Through
some tinkering we were able to make the indicator  say something like tire
pressure sensing off. Is there a way to trick the system to think everything
is the way it should be and not indicate anything?  I seem to remember
something in the archives, but could not find it.  Maybe it was something
about bypassing, or jumping some leads? We have the manuals and have been
trying to work off the wire diagrams.
Thanks
Glenn
