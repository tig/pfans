Just for thoughts...  On an old breaker-point ignition system, it is
conceivable that the alternator alone will run the car.  But in contrast
to a modern EFI system, the current draw is way too much for the
alternator to sustain without the assistance of a battery.  The
electronics just simply takes too much power.  Let us assume for a
moment that a '89 GT runs with the battery disconnected.  If this is the
case, then that tells me that the alternator is operating at least 100%
efficient; it generate enough electrical energy to sustain operation by
itself.  Now, what about the EFI system that is needed to manage the
engine's operation?  This system is a load.  So, if the GT continues to
operate in this manner, it tells me that the alternator is 100%+
efficient.  Is that possible?  NO!  It defies all law of physic!  If I
am wrong, does that mean that we've found a way to end the energy
shortage crisis in third-world countries today as we know it?  :-)

	Once the alternator is running on the good battery I believe it
can
	feed its own field coils even without any battery.  While
connected
	to a running alternator (or generator), the battery is acting
mainly
	as a load and voltage stabilizer.  Now if the voltage regulator
	disconnects the alternator's output from the battery line for
too
	long or if you hook up a really dead battery, the current
supplied
	to the field coils could drop low enough that the alternator
will be
	unable to maintain a field.  But other than that, I think it
should
	run.  However without a battery or a really, really big
capacitor to
	stabilize the voltage, I'd be worried about frying the car's
	electronics.
