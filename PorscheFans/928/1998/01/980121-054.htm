Steve:

There's merit to each of the arguments you've listed.  Answer to your
question-- It is illegal to add tinting to the driver's and passenger's door
windows.

The practical answer is that it's one of those "in the opinion of the
officer" issues.  A car with limo-dark tint on those windows is liable to
get a second look and maybe more.

One of my previous rides has 80% tint on the rears, and lighter on the two
door windows.  Makes it look like the fronts are not tinted in contrast, but
still gives some heat protection.  My Europa has plastic side windows in
smoke lexan.  I was actually asked by an officer while in a parking lot
about the color of the windows.  Although it's obviously a dark color,  he
had no trouble accepting that "those are the original windows."

On another occasion I was given a ticket for very slight UV tinting on the
side windows of my Toyota pickup parts chaser.  He said that's what he
stopped me for too,  suggesting that the "commander has issued an order to
focus on illegal window tint."  I asked later for a copy of that, and of
course it was not produced;  I peeled off the tint,  had the ticket signed
off, then promptly retinted the car.   Civil disobedience...

So what should you do?  Tint the windows.  Don't get talked into the dark
stuff,  just keep it a tasteful shade that helps preserve the cows and the
rugs inside.  The rear window is at such a long angle that there's bound to
be some distortion unless it's a very careful job with a brand-name tint.
Too dark or wavy and you'll not be able to spot bi-chromatic chase cars
until it's too late. 

Make sure you get some guidance on removing the tint, too.  It does get
scratched, and should be redone every few years to keep the optical quality
good.  A tint that has to be scraped off means those defroster wires will be
history.  I took the 3M tint out of the Saab with careful use of the razor
blade and the windex.  Over an hour of work but the wire traces were intact.


I may get around to doing mine this spring. Right now it lives indoors both
at home and the office, so the preservation issue is moot.  Come summer I
may need to drive it somewhere other than work though...
