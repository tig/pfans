Ralph, I've been taking my 928 to Mike McCadden at Bill Stephens
Automotive. 7 Canal St. Medford MA, 02155 617 646 2886

Mike is factory trained in all the pre-993 Porsches.  I recently had
my water pump, timing belt, and accessory belts done by Mike. He also
did my pre-purchase inspection.  He has a good attitude and knows how
to treat customers.

Mike does all the Porsche work. And even though he works on other
makes of cars when not working on Porsches he will always drop
whatever non-Porsche work he is doing to immediately work on a Porsche
and he will always move other non-Porsche work around to accomodate
your schedule.

NOTE: I'm not _recommending_ him but simply telling you who I use
currently.  I've had my beast since October so I'm still in
envaluation mode. But at this time I have no reason to believe I'll be
switching.  My next test will be to see what he says when I ask him if
he has the special tool to tension the timing belt at the 1500 mile
mark.
