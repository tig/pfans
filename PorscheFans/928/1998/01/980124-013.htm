Two things:  Maybe i'm being somewhat obtuse, but this seemingly endless =
discussion over the relative merits of various brands and types of oil, =
and the frequency with which its' changed, baffles me.

After driving these animals for 20 years, and around 350,000 miles, I =
can't remember ever having to add so much as a quart of oil to any of =
them between oil changes, which I usually have done about every six or =
seven thousand miles even though my warrantee and maintenance book =
clearly states that 928S4s should have the oil changed every 15,000 =
miles unless they are being driven in severe conditions, like maybe =
across the Gobi Desert, or in Greenland.

My current car, an 87S4 5speed, has almost 92,000 miles on it. Many of =
them hard and fast, as in three day trips from Santa Cruz to Palm Beach =
etc. at speeds  averaging about Mach 1.5.  Have I just been lucky enough =
to get seven 928s that were perfect? or are some of you guys going a =
little overboard with your 3000 mile oil changes and synthetic oils?  =
Not finding fault with anyone's practices or looking for an argument.  =
Just making a factual statement about my own experiences with these =
cars.

Secondly:  Having driven sportscars of all stripes all my life, when I =
read posts by guys being challenged to race with everything from Hondas =
to pickup trucks, I have only to say; it goes with the territory.  After =
many years I thought I had finally reached the point where I could =
ignore all those challenges until one morning about five years ago when =
a guy in a new Corvette started tailgating me in very light traffic on =
I-95 in Boca Raton.  I pulled over and waved him by but he stayed right =
on my back bumper no matter what lane I moved to for about seven or =
eight miles.

Finally we reached a point where the highway picked up and additional =
lane. I pulled over into the right side, slowed down, and waved him by.  =
He finally tore by me and shot me the universal symbol of brotherly love =
with his middle finger.  While all this was happening I noticed a little =
blue Pontiac with two guys in it that were sort of pacing us a few =
hundred yards back, but didn't really give it a thought.

When Tazio Nuvolari shot by me, and gave me the bird, I finally decided =
that he was sorely in need of a lesson in humility.  When he got a =
couple of hundred yards ahead, I downshifted to third at about 75 mph =
and floored it.  He saw me coming and did the same. Into fourth, and as =
I passed him at about 155 and saw the look of shock on his face, I was =
just hitting 5th.  As soon as I completed his humiliation I immediately =
got off the loud pedal and started coasting down.  He shot by me again =
and just about that time, in my rear view mirror, at least a half mile =
back, I saw the blue light come on in that little Pontiac.

I just coasted down.  They pulled along side and motioned me to follow.  =
By that time Tazio had also seen the light and they motioned him to =
follow me.
They pulled us both over and ticketed him first, as he pulled away he =
pulled alongside and told me that they had ticketed him for 100 mph OVER =
the speed limit which was 55. His ticket was $546.00 and they told him  =
to expect at least ten days in jail!

They were young Palm Beach County Sheriffs in jeans and Tee Shirts.  =
After running my license and registration, the guy came over and said: =
"Man! you really blew that guy into the weeds"!  I didn't say boo.  He =
then said:  "Allright, we watched that guy tailgating you for many =
miles.  We really don't blame you for what you did, but did you have to =
do it in such dramatic fashion?  You literally outran our radar but we =
figure you must have been going at least 175!"   I assured him that my =
car wouldn't go that fast and he then said: "Okay, we're going to give =
you a really big break, we wrote him up for 100mph over the limit. He's =
definitely going to see some cell time. In light of the circumstances =
we're ONLY going to write you up for 50 over the limit.  You could =
possibly do some jail time also.  I've been a cop for eight years and =
I've never seen a car go that fast on a public highway before.  My =
advice to you is to pay that ticket right away ($260.) and sign up for =
driver's school, which I did.  Since then I've driven about 100,000 =
miles and havn't been stopped.  Still drive fast where its' safe but =
have cooled it with all characters who want to race. =20

Long winded diatribe, but maybe something to think about when some clown =
in a Camry wants to race your 928.

Steve,

I agree.  I read Brain's post and thought the same thing.  You are
correct...there were only about 300 GTS's brought into the US in total for all
three years and I bet there were close to that many slant noses brought in.
Maybe more.  I know that I see slant nose 911 turbos more than I see GTS's.
You can never be sure though as many of the slant noses may be aftermarket
stuff.

Cheers,
James Morrison
