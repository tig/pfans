I'm looking for some parts for the car that seems like a member of the
family--our 1982 Silver 928, which we have owned since 1986 (yes, I was an
early believer); I'm looking for:

1. Front bumper cover
2. The piece of plastic that includes the gearshift indicator for the three
-speed automatic transmission (appears to install over the gearshift, has
an arrow that should point to the gear you're in--my arrow points wherever
it wants, since the attachment to the gearshift lever is broken)
3.  The piece of trim that goes around the gearshift lever, the clock, the
radio, and the center A/C vents (the one I've found has smaller holes on
either side of the hole for the analog clock--but I don't have anything
beside the clock).

If anyone has these parts, please email me at kjellsen@prodigy.com; Thanks!
