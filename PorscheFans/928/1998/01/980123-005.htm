Hey all you parts mavens,  I need two S4 parts.  First, a door stop for =
my own 87S4, the one  that holds the door open.  I assume they are =
identical but if they aren't I need one for the driver's side.

Secondly, my mechanic is doing some work on another customer's 88 S4 and =
he needs the inner rear body panel.  The one that has the small rear =
speaker in it and extends from the door to the rear of the car.  It has =
to be black.

He called the local Porsche dealer and they quoted him a price that =
would gag a maggot.

If anyone has either part, please contact me, or you can call him =
directly as I don't want to make anything on the transaction.  He's one =
of the few really fair guys I've met in the business and has often done =
things  on my cars that he hasn't even charged for.

He is: Igor Wasilewski of National Auto Projects in Pompano Beach, FL
phone: 954-784-3754.  Thanks.

Gene O'Rourke
