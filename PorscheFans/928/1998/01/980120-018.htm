	I am considering turning my '88 928s4 5 Speed into my everyday
car.  There is
	no question that I would prefer to include the 928 driving
excitement into my
	everyday routine, however I am concerned about increased
maintenance costs
	because of 
	the increased mileage.  

	Can someone please tell me the problems they have had with
everyday 928 use.

My '83 S was a daily driver for about 170K; mostly freeway miles.  For
me, maintenance are just the usual dispensibles; water pump, timing
belt, brake, clutch, filters, etc.  The most important thing to remember
is OIL CHANGE, OIL CHANGE, and OIL CHANGE.  I'm in the process of
restoring it.  Looking forward to putting another few 100K miles when
its ready for the road again.

Does anyone know what the laws are in California for window tinting?  I am
thinking of tinting the windows and like the look of tinting all but the
windshield, but have been told that tinting the driver and passenger windows
is illegal.  Some say it is, some say it is not, some say it depends on how
dark the tint is and some say it depends on the cop.  Any insight would be
appreciated.
