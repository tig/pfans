If you want an inexpensive beater or mule to use as an every day driver,
might I suggest the old Nissan 280ZX, specifically 1980 - 1983. Back then,
these cars were close to "state of the art" sports cars, and even now, the
handling stacks up well against much newer cars. These cars are very
durable, easy to work on, and parts are very cheap if you don't buy them at
your friendly Nissan dealer. In fact, so many of these cars were made that
the bone yards are full of them, thus ensuring easy pickings for parts. The
engines and drive trains are virtually bulletproof. The bodies will rot off
before they die mechanically. I have an 80 model with 198K miles on it
which I use daily for 50 mile commute. The car always starts and always
runs well regardless of weather or temperature. I bought it about 2 years
ago for $900.00. Since then, I have probably spent $600.00 in
parts/repairs/maintenance. A friend of mine also has an 80 model with 245K
which he uses daily approx 100 miles/day.
