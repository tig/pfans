the Porsche feels really heavy till I reach 40mph or smash the pedal. 
My question is how can I lighten the car without sacrifying its internal
and external look.>>

Ferenc,
The dissatisfaction you have expressed is, in my opinion, misplaced. 
The "problem" with the 928 that you are experiencing is not with it's
weight (928's aren't much heavier than a 96/97 933TT, which by no means
feels "heavy"), but with the powerband of the engine.  See, the 928 was
never made for the "American" way of driving, it was made for high speed
cruising, and therefore it feels "heavy" around town.  First off, I
would make sure that your car is running properly, as a euro 928 should
be very quick.  If that isn't the problem then I would suggest doing
some exhaust work to the engine.  I put a set of computer chips from
AutoThority in my car, did some exhaust work, and it vastly improved the
driveability of my car, making it feel "lighter" around town.  However,
since your car can't be chipped (I don't think), I would suggest intake
and exhaust work.  Don't remove leather, etc from your interior, work
with what the car has without affecting it's appearance.  928's were
built with balance in mind, and removing weight without compensating in
the suspension area may just make the car handle worse.  It will also
lessen it's value in a lot of people's eyes.  Just my opinion though. 
I'm curious to read responses from others on the list.
