>oil leak - seems to be coming from right rear of engine - at least thats
where the small puddle on the floor is. With hood open, I can't see any
leakage looking down into the engine bay. It only seems to leak after thecar
sits for about a week. Its a small leak as the level on the dipstick is
right up to the full line. 

Alternator/generator whine - High pitched whine coming from alternator.
Voltmeter says car is charging okay and car starts fine even after
sittingfor 5-7 days. Interior electrical - power mirrors inoperative,
passenger seatback adjustment inoperative. ABS warning light - comes on
intermittently.

Dear Rick and all other "Land Shark" tamers:

Your oil leak is probably one of the rear cam seals. Your alternator wine
may be due to it or its belt rubbing against the lower shroud/cover or it
could indicate little or no air is being drawn to cool it. Check the fuse
for the power mirrors. Seatback switch probably needs cleaning. ABS light is
suppose to come on when the brakes are first applied. If the light stays on,
the fuse may be blown or something more serious needs to be checked.

Good luck and happy motoring. Ed
