 We will soon have the definitive answers on what really works on these 
(semi-) exotic beasts.  I now have a baseline dyno-run from Leonard's 
AutoTek in Austin, Texas (DynoJet Model248E Chassis Dynomometer) on my 
85' Euro 928 engine (4.7L, engine code: 28/12). 
 Background: I retro-fitted an earlier CIS system in place of the 
LH-Jetronic, along with the earlier CIS runners, and earlier ignition 
(single distributor) with Magnecor Wires/Bosch plugs. I also have 
retrofitted an electric fan in place of the Thermostatic, as well as 
removal of the air-pump. The stock exhaust manifolds were left on there, 
but I have dual 2 1/2 pipes with a balance-tube all the way back into a 
3.5" in 3.5" out Borla Muffler. My advance was set at about 38 degrees 
max. Other: Manual transmission, rear tires were inflated to 30lbs, K&N 
Filter was left in, as well as the fresh air ducts.

Numbers:
 The results were interesting: 276 HP @ 6200 RPM, 276 ft-lbs @ 4300.  
Extremely smooth curves; absolutely no peaks/valleys. This means that the 
engine was producing around 330-335HP at the crank--not bad. I have the 
entire HP/Torque curve, which I can scan later in the week, if anyone is 
interested.
 Note also that this particular engine had come from an Automatic Euro.  
And I am almost 100% sure that the cams have a slightly different grind 
(less duration) than a manual.  Just from my seat-of-the-pantys 
observation, there is; in this same car, I had previously an '82 Euro 
28/11, and there was a distinctive surge of torque at 4100RPM--in the '85 
Euro 28/12 it is not detectable.  In fact everything was exactly the 
same--I even took the CIS system off that engine for this one--so this is 
a pretty valid comparison.

Going Further:
 Later this week, I will put back on my long-tube headers, re-enable the 
Crane HI-6TR, and proceed to take another set of dyno runs.  This should 
be interesting.  Let me know if this is a topic to continue publicly, or 
just make private to a few interested parties.
