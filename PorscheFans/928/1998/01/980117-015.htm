I'm sure this question has been asked before, but since I'm new here, I
need to know from the people that own the car in question! Anyway, I am
contemplating buying a 1990-1991 S4 or 1993-1994 GTS, with the automatic
transmission. This car would be used for my everyday transportation
(driving to work, grocery store, malls, long highway trips) in New
Jersey, so it would see four seasons use. But doing some early research,
I'm hesitating due to the 928's niggling problems-of-the-week (or so it
seems) electrical (lights, seats, etc) or mechanical (water pumps, etc)
which would drive me mad if not broke.

So can anyone give me feedback about the general tendency of 928s used
in everyday driving and four seasons use? How are 928s in the
rain/snow/ice? How reliable is the automatic transmission over time?
Would anyone recommend the above models I'm looking at for driving
20,000 miles/year given its out-of-production status? I'd like to just
do recommended service intervals, and not replacing parts that shouldn't
need replacing because of poor engineering/design/material or
unexplained failure.

Thanks for the help!
