"I've recently moved from sunny Key Largo to cold and drabby (no offense)
Toronto, Canada. Although my gas consumption has gone totally south 
because
of the colder weather (I know I shouldn't be driving it) it has been an
incredibly good winter car until now. Yesterday morning when I tried to
start it, it just wouldn't turn over, the starter was working but it just
wouldn't start........"

Believe it or not the reason Toronto is kind of "drabby" (no offense 
taken) is that its a whole bunch warmer than usual this year. Its been a 
lot damper than usual so I wonder if your problem is something as simple 
as condensation in/ on the ignition system. The fact that you nearly got 
it going with new plugs might be some small evidence of that. I would try 
a can of the ignition drier stuff on the coils and distributor caps 
before I called the flat bed.
