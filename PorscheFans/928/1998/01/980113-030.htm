Ahem.  The 911 did not appear until September 1963.

Sorry about that guys, I was just informed that I made a mistake and so I
reread the TWS entry form and sure enough the extended section of track is now
open so it is no longer a 12 turn 1.8 mile road course it is now a 3.3 mile
unknown turn number course.  I think it must be around 15 turns now but don't
quote me on that.  Instead go to the TWS home page at
www.texasworldspeedway.com and count them for yourself.

Hope to see you all there,

I took my S2 crankshaft down to Motor Works today to have it magnafluxed and
otherwise checked out. Trying to make sure it's in good shape before I sell
it. The block it came out of had the sleeve cracked. I was very surprised to
learn they had found a source for the sleeves and could sleeve a cylinder for
under $400. 

I thought my block was a throw away. Does resleeving the cylinder sound like a
good idea out there?
