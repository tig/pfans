So I was looking at a 1987 S4 manual with 82k. Its a nice car for its age in
green with sport seats, locking diff, graduated tints etc. and its
engine/vin numbers and the option codes seem to check out.

Except.

1) Its wet - not soaking, but clearly leaking in the back, the carpets are
wet - the seller says 'they're all like that' I'm not sure. Anyone from wet
climated care to enlighten me.

2) Its had a new front plastic end and behr radiator due to a leak and
deformation of the front wing.

3) The A/C doesn't work - seller says it got discharged when the new front
was fitted.

4) The original books are lost, but replacement has been issued and stamped
by the servicing dealer except for recently when its been maintained by a
specialist.

What does anyone think? Do the front wings deform over time? Would a new
radiator be consistent over ten years? Or does this sound like an excuse for
front end damage repair?

I was looking for a GT but here in England they are pretty rare and since I
wanted a manual S4 shape I looked at this. Now I'm full of doubt over the
trade off between age and price. This is about half the price of a 91 GT.

Any wisdom appreciated. Should I buy it for 12k pounds or stick it out for a
GT for 24k pounds with 30k less mileage? I like the colour and it drives
well - great sound, no strangeness, no rattles, no clutch problems and nice
gear change - no clankig, but theres plenty of small pieces of work to do to
tidy it up.
