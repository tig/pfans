QUESTIONS:

I plan to purchase a 1995-6 928S or '87 S4, probably with 60-85,000 miles,
as my primary form of transportation in NY and Long Island Winters.

I drive short mileage daily (about 8 miles r/t, 5 days a week) and up to
100 miles on weekends on average. 

What I would like to know, can I use this car in snow? (It will be an
automatic.)

If so...which tires do you recommend?...I've heard Bridgestone Blizzaks
work well. 
What gear on the auto can/should I start in? 2?
What oil brand, weight and viscosity should be used?
Which brand of anti-freeze and type do you recommend? (New York
temperatures get down to 0 Farenheit at times-except this year)
How long should I warm it up on cold mornings?
Is there a truly unsafe temperature to drive it?
Any servicing or changes I should perform?
Any other hints?

I really appreciate the efforts put forth by enthusiasts such as yourselves
to help novices like myself. Any car purchase can be harrowing - but groups
like yourselves make the process much easier, educational, and most of all,
enjoyable. It is also great to see such a diverse community shares my
newfound/rekindled love of a truly great automobile.

Happy driving/purchasing,

P.S. anyone know a good 928 service company on Long Island or in the New
York/Metro area (NJ, NYC, CT, 914)? My friend with an '89 911 Cab.
recommends Automart in Levittown, Long Island...anyone familiar?

ABOUT ME:

Hello all. The 928 bug has bitten me. With 2 months left on the lease of my
'95 Acura Integra LS (fun 4-banger, commuter, occasional long tripper (fun
but no Porsche), 42,000 miles in 3 years and one month-on) and my commute
shortened from 60 miles round trip daily, to 8 miles round trip daily, I'm
certainly not buying or leasing a new car as my daily transport...and here
is where the 928 comes in...

I plan to buy an '85-86 928S or '87 S4. I'm not too worried about
maintanance-I've calculated my potential costs well and have reserved for
them...and I know my insurance rates as well. 

At 29, that strange, beautiful, finely crafted  car I fell in love with
exactly 20 years ago at the age of 9, will soon be mine!!! [yes 9  years
old: It's good to have an older brother who was a car show regular and
shared the Greater New York Automobile Show 1978 show guide with me...but
Risky Business reconfirmed how cool it was... (Sorry to wax so poetic, but
this car is a dream come true.)]
