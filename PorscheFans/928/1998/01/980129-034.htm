John,

Unfortunately, I don't have an answer to your tail light problem, but I
think I am seeing the start of the same problem you are experiencing.  The
other night when I left work, the "tail light" warning came up on the dash.
I had never had this happen before.  Anyway, I checked my lights as well
and they seemed to be working fine.  The next morning when I started the
car, I turned the headlights on to see if the problem persisted, and there
was no warning (?).  So now I'm not sure if it was a one-time gremlin or
the start of something more serious.  The only thing I can think of is that
we have had a torrent of rain on the East Coast of the U.S. over the past
few days, and perhaps enough moisture got into the tail light receptacles
to temporarily cause a poor connection.  If you happen to find the cause,
please post it to the list, I will do the same.

In response to your observation about the turn indicators remaining lit
when the turn signal lever is left on and the ignition is turned off.  Per
the owner's manual, this phenomenon is by design as a means of using
parking markers or something like that.  It is described in the section
relating to the operation of the lights.  I personally cannot think of a
situation in which I would use these "parking lights" other than as a way
to accidentally discharge my battery quicker than usual.  :-)
