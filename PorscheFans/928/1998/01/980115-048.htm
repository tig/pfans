Porsche's recommendation regarding MOBIL 1 -  0W-30

Below is a FAQ from the Mobil WebSite.

Q. I HAVE HEARD THAT MOBIL IS NOW THE INITIAL FILL ENGINE OIL FOR PORSCHE.
WHAT VISCOSITY GRADE SHOULD I USE IN MINE ?
A. Porsche has approved all viscosity grades of Mobil 1 for use in their
vehicles. They are currently using a 5W-40 viscosity grade as initial fill.
However, you can select the viscosity grade most appropriate for your
vehicle based on the Porsche viscosity recommendation for your specific
engine and the grades of Mobil 1 available in your area. After you review
the owner's manual, we suggest the following:
0W-30 For cold climate operations.
0W-30 provides exceptional flow characteristics at low temperatures, while
maintaining excellent high temperature performance.
5W-30 For most climates.
5W-30 provides excellent low temperature properties while offering excellent
high temperature stability and performance.
10W-30 For most climates.
10W-30 provides excellent low temperature and high temperature performance.
15W-50 For racing or very hot engine applications.
15W-50 is designed to handled the temperature extremes experienced in racing
and in very tough engine applications (heavy towing).
Mobil does not currently offer a 5W-40 or a 5W-50 in the United States.
