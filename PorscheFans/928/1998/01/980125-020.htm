This may sound helpless, but I think I have a
factory security alarm (I have the long key that
would indicate that I have one), but I don't know
how to operate it, where to locate it and how to
test it.  I have a Chilton manual coming, on
triple-backorder, but I would like to find out
before an upcoming trip.  (I'm also building a
subwoofer box that ties into the back and I
would prefer to keep it, the CD player, etc.)

And, also helpless-sounding, does anyone know
where to look for the latch or button to pop the
hatchback from the driver's seat?  This car is a
real joy for me, but finding the filters, wires and
controls is like an Easter Egg hunt.

thanks, 

cheers

well it finally happened.  Thanks to Brian Buxton I'm now the proud owner of a
1989 928S4 5spd blk on blk w/ 32K.

I drove it home from Canton, Ohio to Hamilton, New Jersey 460 miles......in
the rain and snow.....not how i imagined my ride home, but today was nice.

I do have a few questions that some of you may be able to help me with, since
i'm a mechanical idiot.

1.  I need the names of mechanics in the philly, PA or Trenton, NJ area that
can service my car.

2.  Several times during the ride home the check oil warning display came on
but the level appeared fine, (Oil looked really dark is that normal or does it
need to be changed).  

3.  Can i buy filters at local auto stores or do i need to order them.  I want
to change the oil and filter now.

4.  thank you for all the valuble info in the past and for what is to come.

5.  My bill of sale says the car is a gt.  is that because it is a manual.

P.S. i'm the dummy that almost bought an NSX.  Guess i should change my user
name.
