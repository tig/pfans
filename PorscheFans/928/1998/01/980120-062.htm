Funny, but meaningful. The sunroof motor, linkage and framing weigh a good
bit and so may have been targeted as part of the lightening program which
produced your Simply Exceptional car.

P-fans,

I just had a strange thing happen today and maybe someone out there can give
me a little guidance.

Started the car and the digital read out on the right now has a problem that
has not yet resolved after several restarts.  The right side of this right
hand read out (the one that does Trip I, and II as well as stopwatch) is dim.
You can still see the numbers but they are much dimmer than the left side of
the same readout or any of the others.  What is up with that.  Is there some
back lighting that gave out or is it something else?  None of the analog
gauges have been affected in any way (brightness or perceived correctness of
readings).

Help...this is frustrating to look at...I know it is just a little thing, but
I am a stickler for little things.

Thanks,
James Morrison
