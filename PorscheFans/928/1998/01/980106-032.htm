It seems to me that a slight "roughness" is pretty common in the 1500 - 
2500 RPM range. Some have even suggested that its an inherent trait. 
Certainly my 85 is not as smooth in a similar kind of range but I would 
not go as far as calling it a vibration. If yours is indeed abnormal it 
could be any number of things. I would doubt it being the torque tube 
itself but it could be the torque convertor (who was it who mentioned 
loose rivets a while ago) or the flex plate/ starter ring perhaps. My 
best guess would be the engine mounts however so I would have a look at 
those first. I think your car may be one that had a couple of mini shook 
absorbers to damp engine movement as well so that's another possibility I 
guess but my suspicion is that those devices would be to fix "larger" 
oscillations. My car doesn't have them so I have no experience with them 
in the 928.

You might want to check the pan gasket before you start replacing seals. 
Mine was kind of troublesome for a while. The other thing to look at is 
the plastic reservoir/ filler. There's a plastic nut/ clamp thing that 
was a little loose on mine and caused a slight leak.
