All:

I've been toying with the idea of making a fibreglass panel for the rear
area, extending the width of the tool panel cover.  The intent is to make it
maybe three or four inches deep to hold a 6-disk changer in the middle, and
a pair (or more) of real speakers mounted at the ends.  Looks like maybe six
or six-and-a-halfs will fit out there.  Looks also like it will be carpet
covered to match the covering on the tool panel cover.

It's easy enough to whittle a foam plug for this and make a one-off for my
car.  It would be a bit of extra work to make a mold first,  but if there's
an interest by a few of the owners in this sort of thing I'll take the time.

Think along the lines of losing maybe 4 inches of space at the rear.  The
changer would be accessed through a hinged and velcro cover on the top of
this panel, and the whole thing would attach around the current tool panel
cover with hooks at the ends and velcro straps.  This is about as stealthy a
location as I can think of, maintaining the stock appearance while
protecting the unit from prying eyes.  I found some beige carpet that
matches the current tool cover pretty well.  Might also make room there for
a power amp or two... smaller ones anyway.


Drop me an e-mail if you have any design suggestions, or would be interested
in having one for your car.


My mule for this is my '89 S4, BTW.  Sizewize, it should fit any of the S4's
and GT's I think.



Also:

Does anybody have any info on the now-legendary MB-Q speaker kit for the
10-speaker cars?  Part no's??  Any help would be appreciated.
