What?  Isn't it just a single nut?  There ARE three bolts to hold the
whole damn thing on there, I think....don't you mean the pump itself,
and not the pulley?

Once you get under there, it'll be pretty obvious...if my mem serves
me correctly, it's a bolt you screw in that pushes the unit back,
rotating
it around two of the bolts as a pivot, sliding a third bolt in an arc.

>>What is the torque spec for the bolts?  

The manuals are terrible about torque specs....seems like only about
10% of the important torque specs are listed anywhere, and they seem 
to be randomly scattered throughout the manuals.
