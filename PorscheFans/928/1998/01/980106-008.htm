Well guy's, i did some digging and here's what i found out about my =
shark.  First off, to my suprise my Cardex came back with a description =
as an S4 coupe, which is puzzling.  The Cardex listed my engine number =
starting with prefix 85 and the engine id does indeed match my block.  =
The M28.47 is stamped on the block also.  This matches the code given =
for the GT in my original owners manual technical spec section.  =
Interestingly enough, the options listed on the Cardex include no. 498, =
"without rear model designation" (can any GT owners verify this on their =
cars?).  I was told by a orig. owner who bought his GT new that the rear =
sticker came in the glove compartment and was to be put on by the owner. =
 I also checked my trans. code and it checks out to be G28.55.  My car =
gives no code 639 or 474.  From this data i'm convinced my car is a GT, =
but why the S4 coupe description on the Cardex from PCNA?  I think i =
might  give them a call to check it out.  Any other GT owners have =
comments?
