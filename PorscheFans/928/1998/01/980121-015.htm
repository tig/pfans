Hi All,  

  I have to tell you this story of my 1986 S.  the right speaker was
making noise... and the next thing you know... it is making noise with
the stereo off!  and on New Years eve, I smelled burning wire!!  Scared
the crap out of me!  I babied it the last 1/2 hour home, and the
interior lights had gone out.  The next day I worked at finding the
problem.  The fuse for the interior lights looked fine.  And I know when
my passenger on New Years eve pressed his foot in the upper left corner
of the floorboard (fuse box) the speaker made the noise.  So.. I took
everything apart down under the dash.. and I found burned wires!  It
appears that over the last 11 years, the wiring harness was bent around
the wooden cover for the fuse panel and 'pinched' the wires and grounded
the right speaker wire with the interior lights!  After fixing the
broken wires (which were fused together!) the stereo worked great.. but
no interior lights.  That turned out to be a 15 amp fuse that LOOKED
okay, but wasn't!  So... Remember Guys... Use the little fuse checker on
the fuse panel to test the fuse!!!  No GREEN LIGHT, no good fuse!  

I also had a problem with my mirror control, and the alarm doesn't arm
or disarm from the drivers side.  I replaced the mirror switch with one
from 928 Int. and it appeard to work fine.  I took the car out of the
driveway, and the mirrors still only went up and down, no left/right,
same as the old switch!  Then... on a hunch.. I opened the door and
tried the mirror control... It WORKED!  so.. I must have a kink in the
wiring where the harness comes out of the door.  Maybe the alarm wire is
broken as well, because the passenger and hatch switches work fine for
the alarm.  That is my project for this weekend, to fix that wiring.  

The moral:  Sometimes its nothing more than a worn out wire!  And: use
the fuse checker!   Imagine what would have happened if I took it to a
dealer.. they could have spent HOURS looking for the problem and not
even found it.. and at $65 per hour... I'm glad I went looking myself!
