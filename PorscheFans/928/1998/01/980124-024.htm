Until superconducting wires reach the consumer market, your lights will 
always dim when additional load is placed on your electrical system. 
The voltage doesn't drop at the alternator. It drops due to resistance 
in the wires between the alternator and the lights.

e = ir, and
p = ie, where:
	e = voltage (also "voltage drop")
	i = current (amps)
	r = resistance (ohms)
	p = power (watts)

Lets say your headlights are wired with 12ga wire (0.080" dia) and 
there is 20' of wire between the alternator, relays, and headlights. A 
pair of 65W headlights at 12.8v is:

	p = ie rearranged yields p/e = i
	130w / 12.8v = 10.1 amps

Handbook says 12ga copper wire (solid) resistivity at 122 degrees F is 
1.775 ohms/1000'.

	( 20/1000 ) * 1.775 = 0.0355 ohms

back to e = ir

	10.1 * 0.0355 = 0.3586 volt drop

That's enough to notice lights dim. It all depends on how the car is
wired. Turning on the headlights will dim (or flicker) interior lights.
I'm only using headlights as an easy example. If you are running a pair
of 100W lights then the drop is 0.5547 volts.

My calculations are simplified by the assumption (actually a pretty 
good one) that your headlights will draw nearly the same current for 
any voltage. Originally we were running 130W at 12.8 volts, but now:

	ie = p
	10.1A * 0.3586v = 3.62W loss or 2.8%

Our 20' wire is now dissipating 3.62 watts of our headlight power.

Notice the supply voltage only applies to the equations when I'm 
curious how much current the lights draw. It doesn't matter what the 
source voltage is, 6v, 12v, 24v, 120v, when you pull 10.1 amps thru 20' 
of 12ga solid copper wire there will be a 0.3586 volt drop across that 
wire. This is why "new" cars use 12 volt systems while really old cars 
used 6 volt systems. Its also why 24 volt and 48 volt systems are 
common in industrial and military vehicles. Its also the reason your 
utility company runs 1kV down your street and even higher voltage on 
longer runs.
