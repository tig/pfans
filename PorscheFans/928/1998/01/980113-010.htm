My 84 928S behaves the same way since I got it at 40k and I now have
100k on it.  I generally leave the lever in the off position so it does
not cycle.  I don't know why it does this or if it's normal or not.
It's one of the minor annoyances and I just have not had time to deal
with it.  At least I can tell you that you are not the only one.
