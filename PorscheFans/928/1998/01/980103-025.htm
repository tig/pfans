Would it be simpler to go to the local part store and buy a shorter belt
thatwould fit between the fan and engine?  I know that the installation
would be difficult because
no tentioner are present but by removing the fan, putting the belt on
then bolting the
fan back on (with the right pelt lenght), you should get most of the use
of the fan.

Just a thought that do not require messing around with our "rock solid"
electrical system ;-)
