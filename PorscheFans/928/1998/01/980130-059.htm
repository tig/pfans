I'm buying a touch-up paint but unable to identify the paint no. on my 86 S.
Someone before me peeled off the sticker at the driver's side doorjamb.
I went to the dealer and asked them if they could help me identifying the
paint no.
but they didn't seem to care a 12 years old car. They said they couldn't
identify
the color from vin no. either. What they said to me is "Why don't you ask some
body shops and they may be able to answer you." Helpful people...

So I'll ask the list instead!! The list's so much more helpful!
My 86's color is a sort of a gray metalic with a bit of purple tone to it.
It looks like a gray from a distance. PO said it's Orchid color though.
Does anyone have a same color in 86?
Or any better way to identify paint no.?

Anoter question regarding to paint.
I found scratches (a sort of deep) after service at a shop. Is this
something that
I should just forget about it? What do people do in the situation like this?

Thanks for the help in advance.
