Ive been told that the clicking noise in the back of the car is the cv joints. 
The miraculous thing is that it goes on for a few months with the noise, which 
comes and goes, and then one day it stops moving altogether. At least that's 
what I heard. If anyone knows anything I dont, please post it.

"I'm recovering from the mother of all journeys; I drove my 78 from Montreal
Canada to Austin TX, my new home. The trip was great up until the last 100
miles or so, when I could hear a noise coming from the rear end, it seems to
get louder when cornering and when its under load. I made it back ok, but it
needs looking at. Before I take it anywhere I wanted to know if anyone had any
ideas what it could be, so I can at least sound a little bit knowledgeable to
the mechanic, before he rubs his hands together and I wave my wallet goodbye.
Any help much appreciated"
