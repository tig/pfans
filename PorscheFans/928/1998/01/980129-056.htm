We think of lbs as = weight, but really weight is a measure of force.

With the SI (metric) system of units, it's much clearer, separating out
mass from force.  A kilogram, for instance, is a measure of mass.  How
much a kilogram weighs depends on things like gravity.  A Newton is
the measure of force.  If you found downforce quoted in both english
and metric units in a technical aero document, you'd find it in lbs/sq
in
and N/sq m, *not* kg/sq m.

Absolutely.  The weight of the car affects whether or not the car will
flip, since the aerodynamic force must be greater than the gravitational
force ("weight" of the car * acceleration gravity) to flip it.  However,
the aerodynamic force is a function of the vehicle shape + attitude 
(orientation to the wind) and the wind velocity.  The aero force is not
a function of the weight.

A car with positive lift (negative downforce) at the front WILL flip at
some speed...it might just be a very high speed.

A car with negative lift (positive downforce) at the front WILL crush 
itself into the ground at some speed, but will NEVER flip or fly.

Well, maybe once it's crushed itself and changed its aerodynamics....oh,
never mind.
