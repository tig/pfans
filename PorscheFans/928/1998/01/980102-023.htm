Well my new Minden Silver Pearl paint job has its first need of washing
already.. So I was wondering if it would be going overboard to use my Brita
Filtered water to wash the car with? . ... :P

My question for you knowledgeable folks is this - Until I can drop my car
off and have my mechanic replace the air pump, I am without a main fan. I
would like to short my electric fan to make it on all the time 0 we are
talking about a 78' here. I have followed wires around but am curious if
anyone has done this?

It seems to be pretty good at high speeds temp wise but I drove it around
the city for 25 minutes and overheated at a stoplight... Filled her back up
and shes been behaving since but I would like to get the elec. fan on until
I can get that air pump replaced.. (Max 2 weeks.. )

PS - if anyone remembers my previous difficulties getting my 78' smogged...
Well it would seem that having something inside the catalytic converter
would help... It was something dismissed very early in the process because
the PO swore on his grandmothers grave that the CAT was intact and he had
no previous problems passing it. So for $218 I got a new high-flow cat
stuck in... The guys were decent they even replaced a mis-matched bracket
on my muffler. Anyone in San Diego should look them up, Ed Hansens muffler
in Spring Valley.

PS - If the guy in the Gold 80-83 I just saw on the 8 near the 805
interchange is on the list sorry I didnt wave back, Hope you caught my head
nod. I was in the process of getting around a truck so I could have fun on
the 8west 805south curve... :) I know you understand.

Hi everyone, I have 2 friends and I am considering (not heavily), to update
there S to the S4 look from AIR, American International Racing. They offer
bolt on fiberglass bumpers. How strong would the fiberglass be? Would it be
better to get oem bumpers and fit them on?

thanks,
matt
