I'm going to look at an 86 928 today and could use a little help with a
couple questions that I have after talking with the owner.  He says that
this eighty six model has the s4 engine, is this a possibility?  Could it
have been a very late production 86 and the s4 engine was used on some of
these late prod. 86's..  I think everything else is correct for being an 86
(the front and rear are not updated), but if it has an s4 engine there
should be other characteristics with that of an 87's4... If anyone can
help, thanks in advance as this is my first post even though I've been with
you for about four months.  I've learned a lot just from reading everyones
tech talk.  Oh by the way I'm in South Bend Indiana, I haven't heard of
anything going on around here, If something comes up please post it.  I
appreciate any and all help and ideas you can give me. Also is there
anything special I should look for when examining the car.. I still own a
mustang so I have an excuse for all these questions. After I drove a 89s4
this summer I've had the 928 addiction ever since and my pride and joy
mustang is now seen in my eyes as a nice trade-in. thanks
