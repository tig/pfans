The wires I received were in a clear plastic bag, not in any box marked
as being from Porsche.  So, I highly doubt they were from Porsche.  But
then Porsche does not make wires (or many other items) itself, it buys
them from others.  From what I can tell visually, I would not be
surprised to find out these wires were from the same source Porsche gets
them from.  Actually I would be surprised if they were from someone else
as they match so exactly.  

I compared the wires extensively to my old ones, wire gauge, length,
color, connector (inside and out), markings, etc.  From a visual
inspection, the wires and connectors were EXACTLY like the ones I
original wires I took off.  The connectors were labeled BERU and looked
exactly like the orig.  They installed perfectly as the wires were the
same length as those I removed.  

If your ignition is stock, I don't think you would find much if any
difference in performance.  You would no doubt get more bang from your $
with other modifications.  A modified ignition system would probably be
better off with better wires.
