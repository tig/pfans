Hey Vince,

Couldn't agree more, although, I prefer the other Swedish mount because
they're better in the snow. All Swedish hardware exudes quality, in a
different way but at least as confidently as any German roadware. The SAAB
I have has 190k, is a turbo and still runs like a raped homonid. I seem to
have a prediliction for high mileage cars with electrical accessory
problems though. Oh well.
