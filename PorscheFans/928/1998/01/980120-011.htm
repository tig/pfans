Dave,

	About 3 weeks ago I installed the Series 7 "Sydney" tuner/tape player
in my mercedes. I too spent a bit of time going over the blaupunkt
quality issue. Supposedly these once more are designed and built in the
german factory instead of "sub-contracting" out to an asian house. Hence
there quality is once more "back where it was", at least that is the
sales propaganda.

	I listen to about a 60/40 split between radio and tape so the reception
issue was very important to me. At the moment I am pretty happy with my
choice, but I do (sometimes) get some poor reception on the PBS station
that I listen to. The rest of the stations (I am in houston) do seem to
come in very well. Kenwood is a good tuner, as is Sony's, but I just did
not like the way they looked in the car.

	The tape side of it is very good, only complaint on that is when I
eject a tape it will almost kick it out of the player and onto the
console.

	The credit card sized key card security system is a much nicer
alternative to lugging the goofy face plate around with you whenever you
leave the car. And it does go better, from a cosmetic point of view, in
german cars.

	Hope this helps some; granted, anything can be made to sound good in a
sales booth, but go and listen to one on while trying to bring in fringe
stations. See how it compares to some of the other units in the display.

take care,
david cole
