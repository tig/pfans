OK, OK I give up!

My email has been running 100 percent "take the cash".  Not one person
out there seems to think it strange to conduct large transactions with
hundred dollar bills.  Did you guys pay cash for your houses, too?

Anyway, I still wouldn't sell my 928 for cash - but only because I'm
not interested in selling it.

However, I do have a 944 in need of new shocks and motor mounts and lots
and lots of other little things that I could probably be talked into
letting go if cash was waved in my face.  Oh, did I mention that if I
leave it for more than a couple days it drains the (brand new) battery?
