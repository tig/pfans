"Whoa, hoss! You're seeing the details of people learning to maintain

repair their own cars (some of which have been in many uncaring hands),
often without benefit of proper documentation or tools. if you look at,
e.g., the BMW or Acura NSX lists, you'll see far more pain,
immobilization,
and expense. By the standards of high-performance cars in general, 928s
are
VERY reliable provided only that they are properly maintained. The
biggest
problem with the "properly" part is finding truly knowledgeable service
technicians."

I'll attempt brevity here (not my strong suit).

I'll only add to LL's comments above that if you consider the 1000 or so
list members, the fact that almost all of us have at least one 928, that
we're interested enough to join a 928-only newsgroup, and the obvious
experience and depth of many members as judged by the posts, it makes
sense any casual observer would note the detail and interest most of us
have in getting/keeping our cars in top condition (according to our
needs).   Indeed, the list is a hyper look into all aspects of the 928
(eg performance, handling, maintenance, repair, etc.).

Now, for an update on my 79 Euro - with commentary:

After rebuilding the engine, I had major power troubles.   I thought it
was fixed once, and posted for all to see - but problem came back.  I
was chasing a fuel/air problem.  Conventional wisdom pointed to the ol'
'warmup regulator', which was replaced with a new Bosche unit.   It
didn't change anything.   Many of you responded to my pleas for insight
- THANKS TO ALL!

The trouble is that a misdiagnosis in the injection system can be very
expensive.   I had exhausted my own abilities and tools and was faced
with replacing the fuel distributor or entire fuel delivery system
(pump, lines, accumulator, etc).   I decided to tow the car to a local
shop specializing in Porsches with no less than three Porsche master
technicians (the plaques in their place said so - through the year
2000).  It would be worth the money to specifically diagnose the problem
rather than the ol' trial and error method.

After a month and many hours, the shop could not conclusively determine
what was wrong.   We discussed it at length, and it was my decision to
try a new fuel distributor.  Once again, 928 International came through
by providing a used distributor for a fraction of a rebuilt unit cost -
with a return policy that permitted full refund if it didn't resolve the
problem.  It worked.

The labor charge was reduced for me because they shared my frustration
at not being able to pinpoint the fault - but it still cost me $650 in
labor alone.   As usual, looking back, I could have replaced everything
in question myself for less money than the labor charge.    But, it was
my choice and I can sleep at night.

So.....for the two of you still reading - the fuel distributor CAN 'go
bad' for no apparent reason.   In my case, it resulted in such wacky
system readings that it could not be isolated to the distributor alone.

Whew.....just relieved to have a reliable engine.   Now, I'll go back,
settle in, and continue stitching the new leather around my steering
wheel.   My sore thumbs needed a break!

Again, thanks to all of you who helped me along the way - and now we
have another landshark on the road!   I'd love to attempt the Frenzy,
but will take a rain check for a future one.
