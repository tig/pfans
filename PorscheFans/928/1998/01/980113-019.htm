  They tend to break on their own occasionally and trying to improve on
  that will prove expensive.  If, on the other hand, you're interested in 
  stopping in shorter distances, read on...

  I'm a fan of the steel brake lines because they eliminate a potential
  weak spot in the braking system - i.e. the expansion that could occur
  with the stock lines.  Although I didn't notice a difference in pedal
  feel after I installed them in my car, I was glad I had them recently
  when trying to narrow down a problem in my braking system.  I was easily
  able to eliminate expanding lines as a possible culprit for poor pedal feel.
  
  As far as cross drilling goes, the general consensus is don't drill 928
  rotors.  Unlike rotors for a 930 which were designed to be cross drilled,
  the 928 rotors could become weak when drilled.  On an S4, you would 
  significantly decrease braking distances by installing ultra high 
  performance tires and/or GTS calipers and rotors (allegedly a bolt-on 
  upgrade for the S4).
