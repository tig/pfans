Rob,

Congratulations on you anticipated move.  I assume that from Tucson, =
you'll be taking route !0 across the southern tier of Texas.  If you do, =
there's a tiny little village called Flatonia which is, as I recall, =
about 150 miles east of the booming metropolis of Fort Stockton.  The =
entire town  seems to consist of a gas station,  barbecue restaurant, =
and a few houses.  I'm not into barbecue anything but I stopped there =
for gas a couple of years ago and had the best barbecue sandwich I'd =
ever had.  It was about the size of a loaf of bread and had at least =
half a pound of the tenderest beef imagineable in it.  I ate it as I =
drove west from there and it was so good that I seriously thought of =
turning around and going back for several more.  Try it.

One other thing.  Somewhere right in that area there's a speedtrap =
thats' laser equipped.  I got nailed in it when the only two cars in =
sight to the horizon in either direction were my own and the storm =
trooper who cited me for 73 mph in a 65 zone.   I saw him coming a =
couple of miles away and my radar detector didn't let out a peep.  I had =
to send $80.00 to some cornball backwoods judge name Jimmy Bob Suggins =
or something like that.  Have fun.

Gene O'Rourke
