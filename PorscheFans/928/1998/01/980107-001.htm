For the last few days, I've been driving around with a digital
voltmeter plugged into the cigarette lighter, and it looks like the
dashboard meter is reading on average about 0.6V too low.  Also, the
dashboard guage seems a bit inconsistent; maybe a bad connection or
some mechanical sticking.  But the voltage I'm measuring is still too
low for comfort.  With the engine running and no accessories on, it
goes as high as 13.6V, but with the lights, wipers and rear defogger
on high, it sometimes falls to as low as 12V, which won't do much
charging.

Dave Cooley suggested that anything much below 14.1V means an
alternator diode is blown.  But Jerry reports a happy 928 with a
voltage range similar to what I'm seeing.

For now, I'm just keeping an eye on the voltage and not using the
high mode of the rear defogger.  But when I get the chance, I'll
probably have someone hook up a load tester, or get one myself, and
test both the battery and alternator.

If, as seems likely, I do need a new alternator, is Automotion a good
source?

thanks for the help,
