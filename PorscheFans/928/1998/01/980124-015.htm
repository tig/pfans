Just reading Gene O'Rourke's (Hah! Leonard - two apostrophes in one
word, and correctly so!)  tale of his episode with the Corvette and comments
on people wanting to race us all the time makes me think back over years
of driving sports cars, too.

I had Triumphs for a while.  People used to challenge me all the time, but I
never took them on.  It's not that I was very mature and responsible in my
late teens, it's that I quickly learned that you don't beat a hot escort in a
Triumph of any sort.  (Okay - maybe a TR7-V8, but I didn't have one of those.)

The Lancia GTi and current 205GTi are fair game for any little Jap turbo and
again, I mostly ignore the challenges.  But the one that amused me the most
was when I bought an old Holden Station wagon - a 1971 Kingswood with a
3 speed on the column, cart springs and 186 cubic inch straight six.  I was
upset at having to own it and drive it every day, but I needed something cheap
as a backup for the Lotus Seven that I was racing in (I was 21 at the time) and
so this awful big Holden adorned the driveway.

The first week that I had it I was stopped at some lights on the Friday night
and heard a throbbing/revving noise.  I looked across, and there was a young
hoon (like me?) in a Ford Falcon Stationwagon of the same vintage, grinning
at me and revving up.  I couldn't BELIEVE that it didn't matter what I drove,
there would always be someone in something similar wanting a drag.  I just
collapsed into helpless laughter and received a puzzled look followed by an
angry single-finger salute as he demonstrated acceleration that you'd need
a calendar to measure.

Of course, in the Lotus Seven I would take on ANYthing that wanted to give
it a go in the traffic light drags.  130+bhp in something weighing 1300lbs is
still a damn good way to have fun!
