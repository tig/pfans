It's has now been 4 weeks since I've driven my Beast due to snow,
rain, salt, travel, Christmas etc.  I tried both coasts and couldn't
get away from the rain.

I am now having _dreams_ about driving it almost nightly.  These range
from dreams about donuts in large parking lots to the Devek 6.4 liter
conversion. I need help. And I know precisely what kind. :)


I saw a white or beige 928 traveling North across the Golden Gate
Bridge on Sunday at 12:20 PM.  Was that anyone on the list?  You
wouldn't have noticed me as I was in a rental. You may have seen the
beat up white 50's vintage 911 that was beside me though.


Spring! My kingdom for Spring!


Does anybody else have 928 driving dreams?

Vince...

Couldn't agree with you more.  Blaus are just another piece of junk German
componentry living off a past reputation for greatness (in the '50s and '60s).

And like you said, it's incredible that they are as lousy as they are
considering the money they want for these useless radios.  I've got a cheapy
Clarion that's sooo much better, it's hard to believe.  Can't beat Japanese
electronics (or auto build quality for that matter).
