Just a note to keep Vince happy that the rest of the group is alive. 

1- A reminder not to post any pictures gif, jpeg, or whatever, it just fills
up the list with random text.

2- Attn Gene O'Rourke (and others)
Please check your e-mail program to turn off the MIME function as it causes a
doubled post to the list (Just watch that I may be doing it without knowing
it)

3 Vince Yu was wondering about the few people who post. One factor is that I
get the digest the following day and by then the subject seems worked through,
and late humor would fall a bit flat. My guess is that many of the active
members have an open connection to the net and receive and respond to the
individual posts as they come in (am I right or wrong on this one).

Will try to be more interactive in the future

PS the post on "1986" S4 in the registry noting a build date of 7-86 was my
1987 #0089.

Greg Phillips
84 928S schiefferblaumetallic "Slate Blue"
87 928S4 cherryrot "Rubystone Red"
PPS another interesting thing I have been following is the correlation(or lack
thereof) of the german and english color designations.
