Hey people.. Heres a question for you on california law -

My 928 isnt registered, the tags expired on 6/96 - I have payed all 
the fees but I havent had it pass smog as of yet. Whenever i drive it 
i have the necessary trip permits etc. Anyway, My personal parking 
space that comes with the house I rent is near a parking lot owned by 
the night club next door. i came back one night and found a ticket on 
my car in MY OWN spot! It wasnt on the street or anything, but in my 
OWN spot next to my garage. Whats the deal with that? Can that stick 
or what? I am going through the appeals process but was curious if 
anyone had any insight...

Oh - tidbit for you folks - The daily driver I am in right now is a 
beat up nasty old Nissan Pickup. It just decided to shear off a 
couple bolts on the exhaust manifold.. so as you can guess its noisy 
enough to set off car alarms as I pass at a slow clip. (I LOVE doing 
that) anyway.. to add the the overall appeal of the thing I have a 
busted tail-light. So the other day I was cruising up to a coffee 
house (as much as you can _CRUISE_ in a vehicle such as this) and I 
noticed that a cop made me. You can tell, they always get this kind 
of driving stance and pull in at just the right distance etc.. Anyway 
i have been pulled over enough times so instead of waiting for him to 
get my plates back from his computer and turn his lights on I just 
pulled right on over. As he got out of his car I got out of mine, 
turned to him and said 'Hey, i know about the taillight, I just 
thought I'd save you the trouble of running me through the 
computer...' Now usually I'm in a much nicer frame of mind, but after 
getting the ticket on my car, and having a car stereo ripped off 
recently (On THIS cops beat no less)I was in no mood. So he did the 
whole license and registration thing.. And I guess as a matter of 
procedure he went back to his car to run the plates anyway... And he 
came back, looked me in the eye and when i was sure he was about to 
give me a fix-it ticket for the taillight he said 'this is just a 
warning. Go on about your business'

Go figure. The one time I didnt try and talk my way out of it and I 
STILL didnt get a ticket. I guess I just have a look of innocence 
about me. :)

Can anybody recommend a good place to send my fuel injectors to be cleaned and
flow checked?  I dont have any problems with my 86 928s with 80k miles, but I
removed them to do some other maintenance and thought it would be nice to do.
Thanks
Glenn
