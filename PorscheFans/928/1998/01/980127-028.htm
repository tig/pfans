I don't understand this comment, simply because someone chooses to pay in
cash means they are mafioso, or drug dealers? Cash is legal tender for all
debts in the US, remember? I frequently pay cash for cars under $20k, and
I'm not a mobster (if I were, I wouldn't be wasting time selling used 928
parts for rock-bottom prices :-)
