I think James Brown's slpoenose turbo vs 928 GTS question is freeking
great.  Come on kids, you'd have to be dead and buried to not find
winding a 930 engine up as about an exciting as it gets and is an
excellent way to remember why you like sports cars to begin with.  Go
drive one and try to tell me it's not so.  To me an 86 911 vs 87 (5
speed) 928 is as difficult a decision.  928: comfortable, forgiving,
imposing, rumbling powerful V8.  911:  Killer engine scream results in
hair on end, appearance may make girls scream more than 928 (how would
this not be significant).  I am a total car nut and these are the two
most exciting choices for the money IMHO.  GTS and slopenose just that
much more so.  Let us give thanks to the folks at Porsche for their
engine-neering!
