The doctor I bought my 928 from last fall lives just outside Washington DC.

He mentioned to me that he had previously tried to sell his car by putting
an ad in the newspaper and had gotten numerous responses from people who
came out to look at the car who brought the asking price in CASH!

Fortunately for me, he decided these were not the kind of people he wanted
to give his car to.  He ended up taking less money to sell it to someone he
thought would treat it right (as I plan to do).
