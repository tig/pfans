Hi folks,
The talk about stolen cars and doberman dogs reminds me of one I heard
years ago in Dublin.
This guy (a 911 driver) parks his car in a shady area of town and as he
lock the car a kid comes over and says "Hey mister, I'll keep an eye on
yer car for a pound!" 911 driver says "it's OK kid I've my Doberman in
the car" and as he walks away smirking he hears "hey mister, can your
Doberman put out fires, HUH?"

Ok it's old.

928 Club HOLLAND had our first meeting of the year today (photos will be
displayed on my web page when ever I get it running).
Membership is increasing all the time and there were 928s of all colours
and models except GTS present. 
We had a nice sunny day for it although it was COLD!
A WORD OF WARNING!!! Just in case you've ignored all the talk about
changing your timing belt at the correct interval.
One of the members had his break on the way to the meeting, you can
guess the result! The awful thing about it is, he had his car only two
weeks!! I guess the PO didnt take the thing very seriously.
So dont believe anyone who says they dont break! they may not but 
they might.

Thankyou Chuck for the reply I will be subscribing!
