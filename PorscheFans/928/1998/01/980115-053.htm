     I have baby blue colored Boge gas shocks on my 91 GT on all 4 corners. 
     They also have adjustable spring perches. Does anyone know if these 
     are the "Sport" shocks? I thought that GT's came with Sport shocks and 
     suspension, but nothing Sport was listed on my option list under the 
     carpet except Sport seats, which were also listed as a no-cost option 
     on my window sticker.

     >the blue boge's the sport shocks? I didn't think they were. Thanks.

     >That is one of the things that I would like to know also. I thought
