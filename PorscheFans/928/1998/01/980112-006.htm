I just finished deciphering the option codes on my '89 S4 using the info. at
Phil's outstanding site (thanks Phil!).  I now have a couple of questions. 
The build sticker starts with C02,  is that a dummy code or does it mean
something?  I have code 018 for "sport steering wheel with elevated
hub."  What's that (wheel looks pretty ordinary).   I have code 474 for
"sport shock absorbers."  Are these Boge or Koni, are they adjustable,
how are they different from normal shocks?  I have codes 935 and 980,
seat "cover rear RLL " and "seat cover-Raff-leather."  What does that
mean?  My seats look like they are covered  entirely in burgundy leather. 
The rest of the codes seem pretty self explanatory (although I am
intrigued by the difference between 220 and 221; were two different
types of limited slips offered).  Any info. is much appreciated.  I find that
the more I know about this car the more I love it!
