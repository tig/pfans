My '86S has the antenna windshield and Blaupunkt radio. When I got the
car a few months ago, the FM performance was poor, and AM was
non-existent. I found the antenna amplifier behind the glove box, and
also found the disconnected power lead. After the power lead was hooked
back up, both FM and AM performance were as good as the typical far
eastern radios in my other cars.

Look for a small wire lead running parallel to the antenna lead, and
make sure that it is powered when the radio is on. It appears to be
fairly common for it to be disconnected.
