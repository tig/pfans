There is much to suggest that Porsche regarded the GT as a variant of the
S4. For example, the VIN scheme does not have separate serial number
sequences for the two. The distinctions appear at the equipment level, and
some of those show up with engine and transmission numbers and M-codes.
Visible differences are few, but one, at least for '89 cars, is the use of
two small round tailpipes rather than (apparently, actually an adapter
fitted over two pipes) a single larger oval pipe.

Good; it's 85 for GTs and 81 for S4s.

>The M28.47 is stamped on the block also.

Good again; M 28.47 for GTs, M 28.41 for stick S4s, M 28.42 for auto S4s

>(can any GT owners verify this on their cars?).

This seems to be the way most GTs were delivered (for stealth, modesty, or
whatever reason). This led to a hearty discussion on this list last year of
how a 928 GT rear badge should look.

>I also checked my trans. code and it checks out to be G28.55.

Good yet again; stick S4s have the G 28.13 (US) or G 28.12 (rest of world).

>My car gives no code 639 or 474.

Porsche AG and PCNA have confirmed to me that 639 means GT, but some GT
owners report no such code on their stickers or Cardexes, so it is not
clear that GT means 639 (i.e., 639 is sufficient but not necessary). Code
474 is for the sport shocks, which were optional in both GTs and S4s.

>From this data i'm convinced my car is a GT

Sounds that way to me.

>but why the S4 coupe description on the Cardex from PCNA?  I think i might
give
>them a call to check it out.

If you do, ask them about 639 while you're at it.
