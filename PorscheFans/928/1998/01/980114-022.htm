I NEED SOME INFO! MY HEAT/AC CONTROL IS DRIVING ME NUTS! HAD IT OUT TO
TRY AND FIGURE OUT THE VACUUM CONNECTIONS - DISCOVERED THE MICRO SWITCH
HAS A GROOVE WORN IN THE PLASTIC ACTUATION  "BUTTON" ITS NOT ADJUSTABLE
SO I RIGGED UP A PLASTIC SHIM ON THE BELLCRANK TO TAKE UP THE GAP- PUT
IT BACK IN.. GREAT! NOW THE AC COMPRESSOR WORKED(NO COLD AIR THOUGH..
BUT PROGRESS!!)  HOWEVER, AFTER A COUPLE A DAYS PLAYING WITH THE AC/
VENT CONTROLS THE AC WON'T WORK ANYMORE! WELL THE OTHER DAY I DECIDED TO
GO FOR A RIDE.. PLAYED WITH THE CONTROLS ; STILL NO AC BUT THE  BLOWER
RAN FULL SPEED WHEN I WENT TO DEFROST(PROGRESS! THE OWNERS MANUAL SAYS
IT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT) WELLLL! IT TOO QUIT ONLY AFTER IT WOULD STAY ON
IN ANY VENT POSITION AND OSCILLATE ON AND OFF ONCE IN A WHILE!... HAS
ANYBODY MESSED WITH THESE UNITS?(IT MANUAL CONTROL) CAN THE MICRO SWITCH
BE REPLACED WITH AN AFTER MARKET ADJUSTABLE ONE?, I ASSUME THERE ARE
OTHER ELECTRICAL CONTACTS SOMEWHERE, BUT WHERE? WOULD SPRAYING WITH A
CONTACT CLEANER HELP? ANY ADVISE IS APPRECIATED. THANKS  
.
