Has anyone replied to this yet?  In any event, I don't recall any
factory switch with that configuration so I believe it a P.O. addition. 
Who knows what they wired so you will have to trace it out.  At least
it's not for an airbag!  So it should be safe to put a voltmeter to it
to test for voltages key on/off.   Any evidence of non-stock foglamps or
other clues?
