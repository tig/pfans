Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

If you use a high quality oil, additives are not needed or recommended. 
Take for example Mobil 1. Their chemical engineers have told us 
(PCA Potomac Region) that the product is a blend of many substances 
to provide many (some competing) characteristics required of engine oil. 
If the blend is altered by the addition of another substance, the balance 
of the blend may result in slight improvement in one characteristic at 
the expense of one or more attributes. Basically, change your filter and 
oil regularly (about 3k miles), even if it's synthetic.

"928 Frenzy Zwei" is on the Potomac Region schedule for 9/26/98 at 
AutoThority, Fairfax, VA. If you missed the first one, you must do whatever 
you can to attedend. At present, plans are underway for a day of performance
driving at Summit Point Race Track (the short course) on Friday, (9/25/98). 
We will be limitied to 30 (one driver) cars. The cost for the day is not yet

set, but I anticipate it will be around $125. As the track is already 
reserved, we will be sharing it with another club. They will provide the 
insurance, corner and pit-out workers and instructors. Participants will be 
required to have their cars inspected prior to arriving at the track. You
must 
also have the following safety equipment: 90' or 95' SA Helmet (no
motorcycle 
helmets allowed), All natural fiber clothing including full length sleeves
and 
leather or Nomex shoes. All telephone or other electronic attachments that 
protrude in the cabin must be removed. If the driving event sounds too
exciting 
for you, come (if you can) to watch and partake in the comrodery.

For those of you that can't or won't make it to the Summit Pt. day I am also
planning a Concours and an Autocorss the day after the Frenzy (9/27/98). All
you'll need is a clean car and good tires. The price of this year's Frenzy
will increase to $20 per PCA members ( $25 for non-PCA) with advanced
registration. The entry fee includes: a light breakfast (coffee/tea and
dougnuts), lunch and beverages, and an event "T"shirt. The late arrivals
entry fee will be $25 and there is no "T"shirt. The cost of the Concours or
the Autocross will be an additional $10. (The usual entry fees for those
events are $15.)

I received the information on how to form a "Special Interest Group" from
PCA National Office. Leonard Laub and I are in the process of filling out
the 
required forms. Meantime, we are working on getting our "Club's" recrutement

information into a catalog that will be published in the near future. If you
want 
to volunteer or need more information, please get in touch with Leonard or
me.

Thanks for allowing the long message. Happy motoring. Ed
