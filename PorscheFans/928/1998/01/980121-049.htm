I AGREE COMPLETELY!  When something like this is justified, we ALL 
need to know about it!  It's bad enough when one of us gets ripped 
off, but if several of us do because the first guy didn't say 
anything, something's wrong!  We need to look out for each other.  If 
we don't who else will?

(Sorry for not "snipping" the messages, but I thought it was important 
to repeat them).
