Gents,
I've been told that the top, "long hose" is leaking and thus I have no air
conditioning.  The cost of the hose, I don't recall the amount, was eye
opening.
Although I live in San Diego, and work in Los Angeles, I've been told by a
Porsche repair mechanic of a shop that can do the repairs and fabricate the
hose if necessary.  He sends all of his customers with air conditioning
problems there.  The shop, Dutch Treat in Lawndale had three 928's on the
premises at the time.

Question is, as to air conditioning, is it necessary to have a Porsche
dealer do the repairs, vice an independent air condition repair service.  

P.S. Leonard, 
upon your guidance, I purchased a set of Bridgestone RE 71 tires in San
Diego, alignment was done by the same vendor.  I've been very pleased by
the tires and vendor.  It took a lot of tweaking to get the car to run
straight, it had a pull to the right.  Thanks for the consult.
Incidentally, the color listed on the plate is opalmetallic or some such.
The car is gold in color, has been painted, or repainted at one time or
another.  Is opalmetallic consistant with gold"

<< HI GUYS,
 BEING ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT OF 928 PORSCHES (DROVE MY FIRST YESTERDAY), PERHAPS
 SOMEONE CAN SHARE ,WHAT SEEMS TO BE, YOUR CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE ON THIS CAR.
 1 - WHY IS THIS CAR RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE ? 911 'S OF THE SAME YEAR COST
 TWICE WHAT A 928 DOES.
 2 - ANY COMMON PROBLEMS TO BE AWARE OF ?
 3 - THE CAR I DROVE WAS AN '86, AUTO, DUAL AIR WITH 65,000 MILES ON IT AND
 LOOKED LIKE IT JUST CAME OUT OF A SHOWROOM, FOR $12,000. IS THAT REASONABLE ?
 4 - WHILE I DIDN'T NAIL IT FROM A DEAD STOP THE ACCELERATION DIDN'T IMPRESS
 ME. I ONLY WENT TO 40MPH OR SO BEFORE TRAFFIC, BUT IT SEEMED KIND OF SOFT. AM
 I EXPECTING TOO MUCH ?
 5 - FINALLY, CAN YOU GUIDE ME TO A KNOWLEDGEABLE MECHANIC WHO CAN CHECK THE
 CAR OUT FOR ME IN ORANGE COUNTY,CA ?
 MANY THANKS FOR ANY HELP. DAN
