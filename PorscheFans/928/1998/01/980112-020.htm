Purchased in 89 an 86  928 s4 with 17k miles.  Currently have 63k miles. =
 When at idle  and not moving, the interior blower (fan) comes on, by =
its own choice, at full force for a 10-15 second duration.  Thermostat =
set to any temperature, heater control set to any setting (floor heat or =
console heat of combo) except AC or defrost. This pheromone occurs when =
ever the car comes to a rest (not moving) for 60 seconds or longer.  =
This intermittent fan activity will continue as long as the car is not =
moving and ignition is on.
=20
To be as clear as possible, I AM NOT REFERRING TO the electric fan that =
is mounted out side the radiator in the engine compartment.=20
=20
I AM referring to the interior fan which is used by the AC and heater.  =
I have dismantled the center console, replaced the =
thermocouple/thermostat, air movement fan located right behind the =
thermostat, several vacuum lines in the dash board
=20
Porsche shop manuals make no reference to this behavior.  Atlanta =
Porsche dealership suggests bringing the car in to a look (at $75 an =
hour).  I said 'no thanks'.
=20
Suggestions?
