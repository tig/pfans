Actually, all this talk reminds me of an "alternator" problem I had on my
Esprit:

The car had been off the road for nearly a year with silly little problems
and one of the last things I did when I got it ready to go again was put a 
shiney new alternator on it. I put it on on the Saturday morning and loaned
the car to a friend to "break in for me" over the weekend. On Monday I was 
back at the shop with the alternator - I handed it to the guy I bought it off 
and said "Should it do this?"  It was completely black and charred, the plastic
melted entirely off the end of it and the wires badly burned.

He was horrified and asked what other damage had been caused and
was starting to fill out a warranty claim form when I cracked and explained
to him that it may have had something to do with a fracture in the fuel
line causing petrol to spray onto the alternator and the whole engine
bay to go up in flames!  He didn't hit me... he was quite relieved!

(And, actually, he did a house-call to re-wire my engine bay a couple
of nights later.)
