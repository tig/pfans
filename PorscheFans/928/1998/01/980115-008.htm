Firstly a problem recap for new list members:

My 91 S4 occasionally just won't start at all.  The immobiliser seems to 
turn off okay, all the ignition lights come on, but turning the key has 
absolutely no effect - the dash lights don't even dim.  Leaving the car 
for 15 minutes or so seems to work - eventually it starts no problem, 
but this is becoming really infuriating and I'm dreading the time it 
happens on a petrol station forecourt in front of queue of impatient 
Porsche enviers.  Has anyone ever pushed a 928 single-handed?

Well, the car's at the dealers (AFN) today and I've just got off the 
phone to them.  They can't replicate the problem and they've said they 
can't find anything wrong.  The service manager said:

"Maybe one of the numerous electronic brains is malfunctioning 
somewhere, you'll have a job tracing it if it is and replacement will be 
big money..."

Sooo, the question is, do any of you know which if any of the "brains" 
might be affecting the starter circuit?  

I still think the immobiliser may be at fault, but if this isn't the 
only black box sat between ignition switch and starter motor, then who 
knows?

My thanks to  people who've already suggested culprits - I've told the 
dealers to replace the starter solenoid and deactivate the auto gearbox 
inhibitor switch (I've already replaced the battery and cleaned the 
ground connections). 

Anyone?
