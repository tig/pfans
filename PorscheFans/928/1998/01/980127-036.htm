No, it is always something different. I had no problem with it for about the 1st
4 years of ownership. The expansion valve was the leaking culprit. The next year
was the drier. The year after was the hoses. I don't know what is leaking now. 
Fortunately, it has not been the same thing and nothing big has broken:
compressor, condensor, or evaporator (knock on wood).

One good thing about the AC going out in September is I've got plenty of time
to get it fixed :*)
