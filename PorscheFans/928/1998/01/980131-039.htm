I currently have a cold start problem also.  I believe it is in the Idle
Adjuster (Aux air valve).  This part seems to have several names and
variations.  This valve is supposed to be open when the temp sensor
signals that the engine is cold and close as the engine warms up.  
I would doubt that your problem is in the throttle switch.  This switch
only signals closed throttle and Wide Open Throttle.  This switch could
be faulty or out of adj but I would suspect the air valve before the
TPS.
I also have many loose and deteriorated air hoses that I am replacing. 
Has this been checked on your car, I believe one of the things the
vacumn controls is the fuel pressure via the pressure regulator.  

A test for the Air valve is to pinch off the hose while the car is
idling cold, the idle speed should drop.  When the engine is warm and at 
idle, when this hose is pinched the idle should not change.  

On my '86 I could not perform this test because the hose was to brittle
and the air cleaner housing would probably have to be remove unless you
have a very special tool to pinch off the air hose.  The air hose is
about 5/8" dia.

Hope this helps
