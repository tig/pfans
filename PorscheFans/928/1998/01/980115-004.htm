Dear Shark folks:

Having just about survived the worst winter storm in a century (perhaps),
and with a good part of the state of Maine still a federal disaster area,  I
am thinking fond thoughts of driving my 928 in the spring sunshine. 

Some of you may have heard about our ice storm.  Here on coastal Maine, we
have no snow to speak of.  This storm was all ice, and perhaps you have seen
the pictures of major power transmission towers merely snapped off like an
erector set kicked by an angry child.  From here to Montreal there are
MILLIONS of folks who will be without power for weeks yet, and it has gotten
cold.

Now, I lost power here at home for a few hours several times up until
Saturday night.  Otherwise, no real damage here.  Thus, when I think about
driving my 928, I feel a twinge of, well, not EXACTLY guilt, but the same
sort of feeling that I get when I realize that there are soooo many who
drive their Subarus ALL THE TIME, and NEVER know what it is to drive a 928.

It will be a while before I can get the 928 out again.  Right now, my
driveway is sheer ice all the half mile to the state road.  But just talking
about it is nearly as good as being able to get it out.  IN fact, I am
getting so excited that I think that I will go out to the garage and start
it up, and listen to the sound of it just getting warm.

So, Adamson, you might be just a tad lucky to be able to just go out and
drive in your nice, Kiwi summer, and I might be just a tad jealous.....but
just a tad, since you only to get to drive it on the wrong side of the road,
and that is only half as much fun.

Spring is coming!  (I think!)

Regards,


Roger
