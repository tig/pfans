This message is a little premature, but I just purchased 4 wheels from
Gary Tapp via this list, and as soon as he sends them my way, I will be
parting with my 4 phone dials off of my '83 928s. They have virtually
brand new Pirelli P7000's on them. (Less than 1000 miles: 225/50/16).
The wheels have *not* been chromed. Ha Ha. Anyhow, if anyone wants to
make any preliminary offers, I'll be glad to listen. I figured I'd offer
them via this group before hitting "The Recycler". I'm in the LA area,
if you want to take a look, or pick them up directly, otherwise I can
E-mail you a pic, although we all know what phone dial rims look
like...Even if you don't want the wheels, the tires are worth it. They
are very sticky, and track very smoothly and quietly on the freeway.

Bill

According the factory workshop manual, 80K is the code for Guards Red. I'm not
sure what the other numbers mean.

Hope that helps

As been stated on the list, the VIN number does not distinguish between a GT
and an S4 (for Model Year '90, anyway).
However, according to the '90 Service Information Supplement and the small
Technical Specifications book (1990-1993), the engine serial number does. If
the engine serial number begins with an 85, then it's a GT. An 81 indicates
it's an S4. Again, this is for 1990 on up. The 85 prefix on a GTS indicates a
5-speed, 81 an automatic.
I'm not sure about 1989. Usually, that's more confusing because, of course,
there were 5 speed S4's and GT's in the same year

On the engine block it should say M28.47. , for 89 GT's. Also in the sticker
in the back hatch. If you have this code you have a GT engine.
