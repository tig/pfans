Patrick!!!

Couldn't help but notice that you have a 928/383 in the signature of =
your SHOCKS e-mail.  Thanks for the strut replacement advice as well... =
I am about to embark myself.  But, can I assume that you have but one of =
the best American V8's a ((400 crank, 350 block) =3D 383) in a 928?  I =
have heard of this being done, but have never talked with anyone who has =
done it.  I seriously thought about putting a 383 in an FJ40 =
Landcruiser.  But, once I found out how many parts I would have to =
fabricate to make it fit, I settled to rebuilt the Toyota I-6. =20

Here are a few questions I have:
-  Did you do the work or was it done by a shop or another owner?
-  How does it move?
-  What sort of torque/horsepower does the 383 have?
-  How does the 383 compare in weight with the original Porsche V8?  Any =
suspension considerations needed?
-  Did you use the original tranny or go for an American counter-part as =
well?
-  If you used the original tranny, who made you a bell housing to marry =
a 383->Porsche Tranny?
-  Assuming that the 383 has A LOT more power than the OEM V8, what =
clutch considerations were taken?
-  Where did you buy (or did you make) the engine mounts, headers, =
linkages etc.?
-  How much effort was it to combine the electronics of the German and =
the American?
-  I am a Motorhead, give me the 383 specs - Intake, heads, =
block(aluminum, cast), ignition etc. etc.
-  How much, would you estimate, the whole adventure would cost? =20

Sounds like a fun project!!!  I'd love to hear about it!!!

Peace
