St=E9phane,

Yep, your right.  One of the 3 little bolts was gone, the other 2 were
loose.  These are the little ones, 6mm bolt wiht a 10mm head.  Found a
replacement at the local hardware store with the right metal hardness.

To get access I removed the drivers side air intake tube and then the
top half of the fan shroud.  After that the access was fairly good.=20
Thanks Micheal, there were 3 bolts that hold the pump in position.  The
last one was down low and looked like it may have been for the alt. at
first.  The adjustment for this pump slides straight with a bolt and
lock nut to tension it.  Thanks Leonard for the general torque specs.=20

I just fullfilled one of my boyhood dreams by buying a 86 1/2 5speed, 37K
miles (guards/black). A couple of things need attention and I appreciate
anyone who can inform me about the following:
The antilock brake warning light comes on around corners or on bumpy roads but
not all the time. Any ideas on what this could be or what a mechanic might say
when I get it checked( I plan on buying the repair shop manuals but haven't
yet)
Also, my central locking mechanism wont work- I basically leave the doors
unlocked on the road because its a pain to reach over my shoulder. Might there
be a faulty relay or fuse that could easily solve this?
My brakes also squeak which is really annoying at stop lights- Id rather be
noticed by other motorists for the rumble under the hood.
Has anyone had a problem getting the rear hatch to release with the interior
control? Mine makes a rapid clicking but doesnt open.
Is there a special car jack for spare changes or will any one do? (I found a
spare at a salvage yard for 35 bucks- same part as 944, BTW)
I know this is a lot of questions, maybe not such interesting ones but I have
to get past the small stuff before I entertain thoughts of reconfiguring the
exhaust and other exotic pursuits.
By the way, I don't want to offend anyone but I find Lexus coupes competely
boring looking. I think Angela Lansbury drives one.
