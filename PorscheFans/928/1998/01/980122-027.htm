WARNING - LONG POST

I called PCNA yesterday to check on the options for my car and found 
some interesting discrepencies.  In addition to the items I've listed 
below from the car's original window sticker, they told me I had the 
"optional 'carbon fiber look' lower dash".  I don't see it in the car, 
it's all leather. (?)

They also said the color was "Platinum metallic",  but the door 
sticker says, "Rauchmetallic" (something like that, I can't remember 
exactly).  Anyway, it was a brown color (although it's black now due 
to P.O.'s repaint job).  I would think "Platinum metallic" was a 
silver/gray color(?).

No mention of sunroof/no-sunroof anywhere (my car doesn't have one).

Also, I have NO sticker in the car that gives any option codes, so I 
can't double check against those.

It's interesting that there is no mention of the transmission being an 
automatic as either standard OR optional equipment.  On the window 
sticker, it does say at the bottom under "Model":  1983 Porsche 928, 
285 CID Engine, 8 Cylinder, Fuel Injection, Automatic Transmission, 
3-way Catalyst.



FROM WINDOW STICKER:

Optional equipment installed:

All Leather Interior                  $2,350.00
Monterey Digital Cassette Radio       $  795.00
Protective Side Mouldings             $  195.00
Anti-Theft Device for Wheels          $   50.00
Amplifier System                      $  250.00
Alarm System                          $  300.00



AND,
I've copied the standard equipment list for those people who've never 
seen an original window sticker for their car.  Thought someone might 
be interested...

no extra charge:

So, it seems like just more proof that you can't totally trust the 
information out there.  There are lots of discrepencies.
