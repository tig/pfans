Another post after attempt #3 to disable the mime.  HOpefully the
gremlin is gone.

Some notes:   Options- the only way to have peace is to get beamed up
and go through the mother ship's archives yourself.

                        Bad speedfolk- Droppit willya?  Appreciate the
tip, but the fanatacism over different morality paradigms is what
keeps the wheels sippin' with trash journalism over the likes of O.J.,
Clinton, etc!

                        Transfluid-  I had ggod luck with B&M, but
even better luck with Hurst trickshift.  Faster shifts, tighter band
response, coller temps, reduced wear.  But that was, admittedly in the
days before Redline.  I've found that many domestic "hot rodding
products" perform to a higher level than european counterparts.

    Plug wires- heard good things about the Nology's, especially for
modified vehicles, but I've never tried them.  However, they may
hamper installation of other ignition upgrades packages and systems
(i.e. Jacobs) if your interested in those as well.  So far the best
wire for performance/price is (no, not ACCEL!) Magnecor.  I was
advised by one hi-po Porsche parts disributor (in Vermont) that
Magnecors weren't available for 928s, so I missed out.  I've since
learned that they are available.  They provide more spark energy to
the cylinder, suppress electircal interference with radios and
ignitions systems, and are durable.  They worked exceptionally well on
my (*cringe* 924S).  The stock replacements I hjust got for the 928
don't compare.

    88S4 w/Hesitation- start simple & cheap, replace teh plugs! see
what teh y look like and evaluate whether or not the problem is at all
ameliorated!

No a plea for patient assistance-
    1) Whaddaheck is the "Burma Shave" reference all about?

    2) My voltage regulator passed away, and I missed the discussion
about the capacitor.  The inputs to the guage seem O.K.  WHat should I
look for ane where?
