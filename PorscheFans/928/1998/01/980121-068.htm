>Hello everyone, I have a pair of Infinity Kappa 462P 4x6 plate that fits=

box.
>List price is 160, I'll take b/o.=20

I also have a pair, brand new in the box.  I bought them for my 944 S2 =
and
they do not fit with my stock grills, so I would like to sell them or I
can return them, but that is a hassle since it is long distance.  So, if
anyone is interested I will let them go for $90.  List is actually $170.

The Kappa has a 4" midrange/mid bass with injection molded quartz cone =
and
a separate silk dome tweeter for smooth response.  I've heard them and
they are quite nice.  The more power the better.  Efficiency is 89 db.

The thing is that police officers are people, just think to yourself and put
yourself in their shoe's, what makes you nervous? Approaching a car that may
have been speeding, and not able to see inside?  First thought would be that
the drivers hiding something or getting something out, a thought you don't
want to give anybody.

 Your point about rolling the windows down is very good.  Spotlights on
 patrol cars get focused on the side mirrors to illuminate the inside of the
 car.  Tinted windows increase the officers nervousness, since the inside is
 still dark.  Roll down the windows and turn on the interior lights if you
 really want to make his day.  He definitely won't notice the tint, and his
 attitude is likely to be much better.
 
 It also helps that it wasn't  --your-- Datsun 240Z that hit-and-run'd that
 little kid in the crosswalk at over 100... 
 
 
 There's a whole list of things that keep the officer in a good mood when you
 get pulled over.  As many will undoubtedly testify,  sometimes it works and
 sometimes it doesn't.  You are just improving the odds a bit.
