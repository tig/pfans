Hi,

I'm researching buying a 928 and would like any comments on 928
resources in the Boston, North Shore, Southern NH or Maine area.
Assuming I find a car I'm interested in, I'd like to know about a decent
mechanic familiar with 928's to go over it. Not to expose myself to
flames, but I also suspect that owners of 928's are well advised to have
a good relationship with a mechanic in any event. Does anyone have any
comments on Ira Porsche/Audi in Danvers?

Also if anyone knows of a good 90 or newer GT or S4 or maybe GTS around
New England, I'd appreciate hearing about it. 

FWIW, Ira has a decent looking 86 S for about $18K on their lot. As I
recall it had 58K miles, red paint, auto, cosmetically looks very good.
I didn't drive it or ask potentially embarrassing questions about timing
belts, etc.

Thanks,
Ralph
