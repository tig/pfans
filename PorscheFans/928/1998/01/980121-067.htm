Does anyone know of some one who could help me or show me how to replace =
the
timing belt on an '83 928s 4.7L in Connecticut or Massachusets?  I've =
done
belts on Fords and chains on Pontiacs but I would feel much better and =
would
be more than willing to pay for any time spent on my 928.  The car is
running fine so I can drive it to wherever the job will be performed.
Thanks in advance.

PS. I just had quite a bit of body work done on the 928 after our =
unfortunate meeting with a Jersey Barrier last May and I'm not to happy =
with the way the bumper cover and hood line up,  Has anyone in CT or =
Mass ever done any of this type of work on a 928.  It's only a little =
off but I would like to get it a little better before it gets painted.  =
Anyone?

(83 928s 5spd)
