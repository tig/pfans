	[snip]
	My problem is that radio reception is slightly fuzzy. Does
anyone know
	if Porsche gave up the windshield location for this reason? I
also
	notice the reception is clearer when I'm travelling north, which
is
	toward San Francisco, and presumably the transmission towers.
	I've asked the guys at the audio shop if there is a "booster"
type
	solution but their response was about as fuzzy as my reception.
They,
	instead, cast aspersions on the factory Blaupunkt "Reno" that
I've got
	and that I believe was standard issue. Any ideas on which is
suspect?

In my opinion, Blaupunkt is one of the top ten sh*tiest radio that money
can buy.  And they are not cheap.  For reasons only known to Blaupunkt,
their tuner design is very poor.  It is just not sensitive at all.  I
have a Monterey and a Charleston.  Each of these radio only able to
receive ONE clear station in my area.  Unfortunately this one stadio is
a Spanish station.  Just out of curiosity, I hooked up an old Kenwood
and was able to receive four stations instead!
