Hello All,

At long last I have finally realized one of my dreams, I am the proud owner 
of a 928!  It's a beautiful '85 European 928S Automatic, white with black 
leather interior, phone dial wheels, 40K miles and is in superb condition. 
 I managed to get a 3 year 45K mile bumper to bumper warranty in the deal 
as well.  I just couldn't pass it up.

This car is a BLAST to drive!!  It exceeds my expectations by far, 
blindingly fast when pushed but very well mannered in traffic.  It's a 
wonderful combination of comfort, agility and power that all add up to lots 
of FUN.

I do have a couple of questions for you fellow 928 fans though.
First is where are the best places to find 928 fans in Phoenix, AZ.  I 
believe there is a local chapter of PCA here, do any of you know of any 
other clubs or events?  I frequent San Diego and am interested in any 
events there as well.
Next is a technical issue: When I start my 928 (not every time but most) 
the big '!' warning light comes on as it should to test if it is working, 
but once the engine starts it does not go off.  All warning lights are lit 
as well.  When I rev the engine just past 2000 rpm they all go off and the 
headlights, dash lights, and all other lights brighten slightly, you can 
hear this threshold thru the stereo as well, it makes a tick noise when the 
threshold is crossed.  This happens whether the headlights are on or off.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
John McCoy
