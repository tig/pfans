I would like to request some input:

I have a '85 Auto with 35K miles on it.  I have developed a slow leak of
transmission fluid sufficient to spot the garage floor after each trip.
Upon investigation, I see what I believe to be the transmission cooler
behind the front grille to be wet with fluid.  Also, beneath the cooler and
below the cooling fan, I see quite a bit of fluid on the splash pan.  This
fluid is being blown back into the radiator also.  Therefore, I am quite
positive this is the source.

My question is whether anybody has experienced this same type of leak,
whether the cooler can be aluminum welded like a radiator to fix the leak,
or whether there is an inexpensive replacement transmission cooler in
aftermarket.

I assume the leak was caused by a small flying rock even though the front
of this transmission cooler is covered by a crude protection screen.  Any
response and help would be appreciated!  I do not want to burn out a
transmission due to lost fluid.

Regards,  Terry
