14) --)Dominican Churchill Cohiba cigars, new band design, $300/box of 25
<-- (since owners of 928s obviously enjoy things of superior quality, I'd
thought some of you might be interested in these ultra-rare, and very real,
Cohibas. I bought 5 boxes, and can't possibly smoke all of them @ my
current rate of 2 a week)

These prices do not include shipping. All prices are non-negotiable.
Call or email if interested!
