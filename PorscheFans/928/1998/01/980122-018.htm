Hi P-fans,
I was at work today and one of my co-workers who has the luxury of =
coming in at 12pm told me that Speedvision featured a ducumentary on =
Porsche from the first car produced to present day.  Yeah...that's right =
I'm sitting at work at a computer terminal while a show on mine and your =
favorite car was on.....aaaargh!    I missed it. =20
My point to all this is that, I was wondering if anyone got a copy of =
this on video tape that would be willing to dub a copy for me.  I'm =
willing to pay a fee (obiously to outrageous).  I'll pay for the =
shipping involved. =20
So if you were lucky enough to get a copy and can help me on my quest =
please e-mail me.
Thanks again
Happy Porsche-ing
