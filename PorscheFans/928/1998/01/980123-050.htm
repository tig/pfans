What follows is a message from the BWM digest about Nology wire.
Those that are genetically pre-dispositioned to anti-BWM hysteria
should do a quick query-replace before reading....

Subject: <all> Feedback On Nology Wires

BMW Digesters:

Below is a 'reprint' of experiences with Nology Wires, which has been
a topic of interest on this Digest on and off in the last several weeks.
I am forwarding this with the kind permissions of the author, Phillip,
and the Volvo Digest owner, Steve Seekins.  Thank you, gentlemen.

BTW, if you, too, have two loves (and the other one is Volvo), please
try Steve's Volvo Digest at:  owner-vcoa-digest@kryten.woc.atinc.com.
Similar majordomo functions, excellent advice and moderation.

Subject: NOLOGY WIRES

NOLOGY WIRES.  I bought a set of these and ran them on my 242T and have now
modified them and put them on my 745T.  They cost about $150-175 per set and
that does not include a coil wire.  You must also use non resistor plugs, so
you'll have to buy a set of those, too.

I would put these into the "not sure whether they do anything or not"
category.  There are other improvements I would spend my money on first.  I
am sure that they increase radio noise dramatically and that that problem
will have to be addressed somehow.  I have not gotten around to it yet.

I called MSD and they told me the Nology wires were like Splitfire plugs and
wires, more advertising and hype than anything else.  I called Crane and they
told me their computer would not work with Nology wires, although I have
heard this may no longer be the case.  I called Magnecor, a maker of very
high quality after market plug wires, and they told me the Nology wires would
not help.  I called TorqueMaster, whose surface gap plugs I have used for
years (note that Bosch is now coming out with a surface gap plug in wide
automotive applications) and he said that the wires do help with emissions on
marginal cars.  He sells the wires at a discount.

The capacitor technology has been around for years and was used in the 1960s
on plug wires.  It is basically a ground for the plug wires.

Given that the Group A 242 Turbos ran stock ignitions and wires, as do, I
believe, the TWR 850 race cars, I would think carefully about where on your
priority list you want to place these wires, unless you are trying to make an
older car pass emissions.

The Magnecor wires are good, but won't add any power.  Wisdom is that no good
plug wires will add power, but that bad wires will cause problems.  MSD and
Accel make universal wire kits of low resistance wire.  They are for V8s, but
you could make up two sets.  They are cheap, too.  Look in Summit.

One of the car magazines dyno tested the Nology wires and had to make many
changes in fuel, timing and other things to gain just a few hp.  RIght out of
the box, the Nology wires lost hp.  The fuel and timing changes might have
added power without the Nology wires.

Brian Buxton said that the 911 slantnose turbo was 10X rarer than the 928GTS,
in the course of discussing the pros and cons of each model.

My point is....I thought that only about 300 GTS models were sold in this
country during its 3-year model run, which is pretty darn rare indeed.
Brian's point would make slantnose sales at only 30 units in total, which I
find hard to believe.

So, is this true?  Or were you just trying to make some other point about the
cars' relative value to collectors, but not really related to actual quantity
of vehicles sold?

Interested in finding out.
