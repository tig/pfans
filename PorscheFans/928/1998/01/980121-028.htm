Hi, all.
Thank you very much for the info. on mechanics in RI area and clutch
replacement cost (David, Ed)!!

Now, the car is at a local shop and parts were taken out.
But the mechanic gave me a call this morning and asked me if I want the
plate changed as well.
The current plate has some wear on it and the mechanic told me the new
clutch will chatter if the new
plate is not installed because the surfaces won't match untill eventually
the clutch wears in the shape
of the plate wear. I asked him if he would change the palte if he were me
and he said that he would take
a risk to leave the current plate.

All sounded like it's depending on if I care the chattering or not.
I don't mind the chattering but I do if the old plate will lead my 928 into
some bigger problems later on.

The cost of the new plate is about $700-800.
My 86 has about 110K miles now.

Is it worth changing the plate???

I would appreciate if someone could give me some expert advice.
Thanks in advance.
