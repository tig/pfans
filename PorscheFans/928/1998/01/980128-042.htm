	Aerodynamics causes negative (good) or positive (bad) lift.  The
lift adds to or
	subtracts from the force pressing on the tires, which is
directly proportional
	to traction, e.g.:

	Traction = (some linear factor) x (force downwards)

	where

	force downwards = (mass of car) - (lift)

	Granted, if you've got positive lift at the nose, a heavy nose
can keep the nose 
	from lifting until enough air gets under it to flip the car.
However, the static 
	aerodynamic lift generated by a car at different points on the
car is determined
	EXCLUSIVELY by the shape in the wind.  This is why cars are
tested in wind
	tunnels as "bucks", fixed to the floor of the wind tunnel.  Of
course, the spinning
	tires do change the turbulence and affect the flow, hence more
advanced wind
	tunnels will have the car on a dyno, but I think that's WAY
beyond the scope
	of what we're talking about here!

	Now, the aerodynamics of the car change radically if the wind is
able to lift the
	front up (even if it doesn't come clear of the road surface),
since now you're
	presenting a different shape to the wind's vector (which we
assume is still
	parallel to the road surface).

	In summary, the Camaro flipped because it had crappy
aerodynamics, causing
	excessive lift at the front at speed.  More weight in the nose
might have prevented
	the accident, since the lift force might not have been
sufficient to raise the mass
	of the car, but the solution is NOT to add weight, it's to clean
up the flow at the
	front of the car.  Usually, mfgers do this by adding air dams or
chin spoilers to 
	deflect air to the sides or above the car, rather than under it.

	I'd send you the list of honors physics courses I got A's in at
university, but
	my ISP has a limit on email message size.
