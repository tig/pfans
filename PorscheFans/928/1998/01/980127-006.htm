Warren, 
Get use to buying EVERYTHING mail order.  No one stocks 928 parts,
except for generic stuff like spark plugs and the battery anyway.  If a
local parts store is willing to special order you a part, be prepared to
pay big time.  Mail order is so much cheaper and since you have to wait
for someone middle guy to order the part anyway, you may as well mail
order.  

Join The Porsche Club to get your subscription to Panorama Magazine,
grab a copy of Excellence and perhaps European Car to find sources for
928 parts.  I have found the same part from the same reseller advertised
for various prices is different mags.  Pano usually has the better
prices.  Also check the web pages of resellers who have them for their
monthly web specials.  

> 3.  Can i buy filters at local auto stores or do i need to order them.  I
want
> to change the oil and filter now.

BTW, you e-mail address does not show up in your post.  Not sure how
that works, perhaps you need a field filled out in you e-mail program?
See if you have it specified in your mail programs settings.
