Hi all,

just thought I'd drop off a quick note to sing the praises of 928 International.

After looking EVERYWHERE for a set of wheels for my S4 (and getting lots of 
great offers that were just a bit more than I wanted to spend for snow rims)
I called up 928 Intl and they had a set of 16" S flats for $600. This was still
a bit more than I wanted to spend, but was the best offer...so I took it.) Later
that day, Mark Anderson e-mailed me to say that after looking through his stock
he had a cosmetically grungy looking but functionally fine set he could sell for
$300/set.  I called him back today and latched on to the less expensive set.

When in need of parts, I always call 928 International at (714) 632-9288
and they certainly have saved me a lot of $$$  (Just wish I called them first
about wheels...would have saved a LOT of time as well)

p.s. I like Devek too, but haven't ordered as many things from them :)
