I actually believe that NZ *and* US drivers drive on the wrong side of 
the road, and here is why: (based on something I read a long time ago, 
and my memory is a little foggy)
As the earth revolves, a moving vehicle is subject to the Coriolis 
(sp?) force. On the northern hemisphere, this results in the 
right-hand side of the vehicle pushing down just little harder on the 
road (and down-under, it would be on the left-hand side).
If you drive on the right side of the road (left side below the 
equator), then this additional force - over time - further rounds off 
the road, which is already higher in the center. Eventually, the road 
will be so rounded that you can't drive on it anymore.
So the Brits got it right when they decided to drive on the left side 
(in the northen hemisphere) as their roads will last longer that way, 
but must have forgotten their superior physics reasoning when they 
exported left-side driving to NZ. So there.

Yes, perhaps this is so, Chris, but I am sure it only appplies
where all roads lead to Rome. Following this logic it would also
be prudent to ensure that you always measure your cars performance
facing East, because those resultant forces will ensure better
traction while getting off the line.

Philip
