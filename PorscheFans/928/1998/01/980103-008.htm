Jim,
I had a similar charging problem about a year and a half ago with my
'84. After I took the car in for all belt replacement, my mechanic
noticed the alternator had a loose solder joint on one of the windings.
He soldered the bad connect and the alternator worked better.  But,
one day six months later, when starting the car the whole warning
system lit up like a Christmas tree. The alternator was no longer
charging at all. I pulled it off and sure enough one of the connections
was broken again.

I purchased a rebuilt from Automotion (3 year warrantee) and the system
has been working fine since.  The voltmeter reads 13.8-14.0 when just
started and 13-13.5 when the car is hot.  With lights and fans and
stereo on, it can get as low as 12 when waiting at a stoplight.  
As soon as the RPMs get above 1500, voltage readings will return to
normal levels.

The regulator bolts on the back of the alternator, so you could try
replacing it first.  Any good alternator shop can test your alternator
and regulator if you are willing to get underneath and pull it off.  
Its a pretty simple job.
