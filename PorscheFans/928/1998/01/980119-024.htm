Well, the FAQ is back on.  It appears that the server crashed and the
file were lost.  No comments came from my service provider so thanks
to Phil for noticing.

The question of finding a good mechanic is coming more often on the
list.  Would people appreciate a list of 928 mechanic in the FAQ?

If so let me know.  I had in mind something like:

State, Name of business, Address, phone #, name and e-mail of person
recommending them.

Although I do not require a name and e-mail for technical advice, I
think they need to be mandatory for recommending a garage.  People
can then e-mail you for further details and this gets me off the hook
if something does not pan out (hey, everyone screws up once in a
while...)

A big disclaimer would also start the page, saying that the garage are
recommended from the name listed and that I am not bribed to put
names in the list (well, no one tried yet...)
