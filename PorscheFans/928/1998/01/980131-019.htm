Hi,
        Was at my MB dealer today getting info on the CLK430 -
and saw they have a nice 91 928S4.  It is blue ext/grey lthr int, 
auto, rear AC, low miles, design-90 rims, pretty clean.   I
think the miles were around 32k or so, and they had the complete
records, etc.  The dealer is asking $32.5k for it - if anyone
is interested let me know and I can get more info.
        My 928 has been in storage for the past few months,
I plan on taking it out in a month or two, are there any
steps I need to take other then having the battery fully
charged and a full tank of gas put in before I take it 
out of storage?  I stored the car without the battery, 
garaged, covered, steel wool in the exhaust, and stabil
in the gas tank.
        Also, my 85 has a all leather interior - there is
shrinkage of the leather in the hatch area and on the
dash around the vents.  Is there an economical way to
redo these interiors parts?  Ie - replace with used
interior pieces or have someone redo the interior.  
               
Thanks,
-Mike
