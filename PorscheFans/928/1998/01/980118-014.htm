tank ventillation system isn't clogged.  To test this, when you reach
1/2 tank and younotice a performance decrease, open the gas tank filling
cap and see if you hear
air rushing in.  If it does and the performance seems to increase for a
while, you need
to chase your ventillation system down.

If this system was not working properly, it might have caused the old
pump to
fail because it had to work against your tank vacuum all the time.

Just a thought...
