Hi Everybody,

With regards to the British 928S4 Sport.
I have actually seen 3 including my friends car. Two are Guards &  Red
one is Black.
They are all manual and have the same interior:
Black cloth "sports" seats with a red pinstripe, piping and electric
height adjustment.
They also have the 8" & 9" wide, 16" Forged "Club Sport" rims with
spacers.
Apart from the wheels, they differ exteriorwise in only a small "Sport"
sticker on the rear, next to the S4 badge.

Have never seen details of the car in a book.
The 928 SE seems closest.
It not the same as the CLUB SPORT which was missing all the extras to
save weight. The SE is listed in the "928 PERFORMANCE PORTFOLIO".
The road test of which mentions that the engine is listed as being the
same power as an S4. But the car feels quicker and is better against the
stopwatch.
I have a few details of the S4 Sport in an old copy of 'Christophus'
back home somewhere but that's about it.
I have no access to my reference material out here in Africa.

Does anybody have anymore details and some road test data on the S4
Sport?

PS: Our server/network went down for a couple of hours. So any replies
to me after Lenonard and Philips may have been lost.

THANKS GUYS
