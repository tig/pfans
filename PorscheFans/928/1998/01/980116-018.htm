Spring Choices:  OEM parts, (maybe sport springs, S4 or GTS components
will fit if you want something stiffer).  Devec coil overs.  Weltmeister
springs from Automotion.  One thing to do is measure the your old
springs, while they have no load on them, and see just how much they
have sagged.  I guess this can't be done in situ.  [maybe someone has a
clever idea, here?]

I went the way of Koni Red dampers, and Automotion springs, but cannot
report because they are languishing on the repair garage floor, while
the car is a mangle at the panel shop.  I considered Devec's coil overs
(600 lb non-progressive) a bit too stiff for the street, but believe
they can do springs to order.

Can your Bilsteins be rebuilt?  Are they original equipment?  This may
point to a sports suspension package on your car.  I think the cars came
with Boge shocks as standard.  [Comments anyone?]

Sagged springs will also tend to make wheel alignment more of a problem,
typically resulting in the front tyres being shredded on the inboard
edges.

Different shocks may require different mounting platforms, but you'll
need to ask someone else about this.

LL has also been encountering terra firma more often than he'd like, and
was waiting for me to report on the Koni/Weltmeister setup.  Sorry LL
the test bed has been put to bed, and this post was probably long enough
to put anyone to sleep.
