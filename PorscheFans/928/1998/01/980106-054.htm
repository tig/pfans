John's story reminded me of the same situation that
happened to me last Halloween night.
I was leaving a club, late at night, and as I was
heading home I spotted the trooper following me. I
figured he was looking for signs of DUI, etc., but
I'd be damned if I was going to let him follow me
all over the place waiting for me to do something
wrong, so I pulled into a gas station and got out of
the car to pump some gas. This is where the story
departs from John's version. The lights go on.
"Freeeeezzzzeeeee!!!! We didn't say to get out the
car! Get your hands on our hood. Spread 'em!" They
search me, search the car. "OK, you can relax while
we run you through the computer...." "GET YOUR HANDS
OUT OF YOUR POCKETS!!!!!" This crap went on for a
half hour. Welcome to LA.
