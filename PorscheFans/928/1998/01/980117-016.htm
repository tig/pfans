Yes, but its snow traction is not even vaguely comparable to the Integra
you're giving up, and you'll need to tread lightly on the throttle to avoid
breaking the rears loose. Also, it's very low, so can get bogged in snow
more than a few inches deep.

I live north of you (northern Westchester) and use mine all winter, but not
in terrible weather.

>If so...which tires do you recommend?

Because it isn't always snowing, you'll be better off with sport-oriented,
speed-rated snow tires. I have a set of the Michelin X M+S 330s in stock S4
sizes on my original rims, but have not yet used them due to two successive
near-snowless winters. Pirelli and others also make performance snow tires;
read all about it on Tire Rack's site
(http://www.tirerack.com/tires/types/snows.htm).

>What gear on the auto can/should I start in? 2?

On slippery pavement, starting in second is a good idea.

>What oil brand, weight and viscosity should be used?

I've had no trouble in cold weather with a good synthetic 20W-50 (I use
Amsoil Series 2000; other good choices are Red Line 20W-50 and Mobil 1
15W-50). Non-synthetics at this weight will get gooey and inhibit starting
at really low temperatures. I discourage you from using lighter weight
oils, because they will not protect the engine as well at high speed and
high load, something you may find yourself engaging in even in the winter
(clear days and all that).

>Which brand of anti-freeze and type do you recommend? (New York
>temperatures get down to 0 Farenheit at times-except this year)

This list has had a lot of discussion of antifreeze interaction with the
aluminum block and with the water pump; consensus seems to be stick to
phosphate- and silicate-free mixtures.

>How long should I warm it up on cold mornings?

You can start to move as soon as you get a stable idle, but take it easy.
You should not ask for lots of power until the coolant temperature has come
up to a normal level, and preferably should also wait until the oil is
fully warmed up (shown by the oil pressure gauge dropping to 2-3 bar at idle).

>Is there a truly unsafe temperature to drive it?

No. Porsche designed this car to operate in any climate.

>Any servicing or changes I should perform?

Make sure all the belts and hoses are healthy and all fluids fresh and up
to proper level.

>Any other hints?

Acquire a small front-drive "beater" car to use in terrible conditions;
save the 928 from getting stuck or getting smashed.

>P.S. anyone know a good 928 service company on Long Island or in the New
>York/Metro area (NJ, NYC, CT, 914)? My friend with an '89 911 Cab.
>recommends Automart in Levittown, Long Island...anyone familiar?

I happily drive an hour to get to the best 928 fixers I know, Autosport
Designs in Mineola (http://www.smarttrac.com/autosport/). Talk to Tom or
Barry and tell 'em I sent you. They may also be able to help you find a
car, and certainly can give you a reliable pre-purchase inspection of any
hot prospect.
