Alex:

I went to 'Sheepskin City', actually their tinting business at the same
store but can't remember the name right now - Solar Guard or something
like that, anyhows check out 'skin City on Cesar Chavez Blvd. in SF.  At
the time the job was $99 for all three rear windows!  Closer to $150+
nowadays.  The sides are one piece - I think this is what you want.  The
rear hatch is indeed two pieces but they effectively hide the seam along
the defroster trace so it's practically invisible!

They are a very small family shop but have been tinting for years at the
same location.

Check it out.
Phil
