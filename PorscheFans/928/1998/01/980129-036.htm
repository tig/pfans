	Hello fellow Porsche Brothers and Sisters,
	          
	          PRO-Long...is it safe?   My Porsche manual states that
no 
	additives should be added to the oil.  i went to the auto show
and 
	Pro-Long was there and he told me that it is not an additive.
It 
	contains no metal, solids, etc.  What do yous think?

Since the PO stripped the oil drain plug on my '78, I decided to use
PRO-Long.  Its a wonderful product!  You only treat the engine once and
it will protect it forever!  Do away with oil change, filter
replacement, leaky oil pan gasket!  My '78 now runs much better than
before and WITHOUT oil!  Even up to REDLINE!!!  This is an unbelievable
technology breakthrough!  I even threw a couple pounds of sand through
my intake just to confirm that PRO-Long is performing as advertised.  It
did!  I was skeptical at first, but after hearing that Al Unser uses it
on his Viper out in the desert at 120 degree heat in the shade, and
trying it myself, I'm a believer!
