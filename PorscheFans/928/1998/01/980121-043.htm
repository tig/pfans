Mike,

If you had been following the list for a while you would be aware that
Marc had actually given us all a decent and rational explanation for his
opinions on Speedman.  There is no personality involved and in fact Marc
kept the whole thing quite free of emotion (surprising and laudable in the
circumstances.)  I also recall that it took quite a bit of prodding before
Marc would actually tell us the name of the individual who had defrauded
him.

I am grateful to Marc for being prepared to put his money where his 
mouth is (or in this case, use his mouth to tell us where his money went) and
let the rest of us know that this guy Speedman may not be quite what he
tries to seem.

Marc, my mother tought me that if you can't say anything nice about
someone.. keep your mouth shut.... 

This list is great for talking about cars, and meeting interesting people
(boring people don't drive 928's)  :)  Lets try to keep personality
conflicts out of it.  

Sincerely,
Mike Clemens
