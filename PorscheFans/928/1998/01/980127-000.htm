If the 928 got any lighter it would fly. I had a buddy who purchased a new
Z28 Camaro. He went to take it to top speed and the car lifted off the
ground and turned over (too light for high speed). The whole front end
lifted like he was drag racing. I like to heaviness of my 928.  I feel safe
at high speeds.

About a year ago I saw a local accident between a 928 and a american made
sedan. The 928 cut the car into two piece (just like a Shark). The 928 was
damaged but still  in running condition (he drove off later).

I was traveling to San Diego on a windy Santa Ana (wind gust, blows down
branches and sometimes power lines) day in my 928S. All car and truck were
traveling at 45-50mph because the wind was blowing car and trucks out of
their lanes. I was traveling at speeds in excess of 80 mph. The 928s did not
even budge laterally. It cut through the wind and held low to the ground.

I assume that the weight of the 928 is by design. When traveling at speed in
excess of 150 mph or more you do not want to be lifting off like a 747
(boeing).

havent had time to change my user name yet, but will work on it soon.

On Sunday nite and Monday afternoon my 928 stalled once.  both times when i
came to a stop with the clutch pedal depressed.  I barely realized that it was
stalled because it gave no indication.  it just quit.  Yet, it started up and
drove fine the rest of the way home.  Any ideas?

I'm still looking for a mechanic if anyone has any.  I really need to have
this car checked out.  and i can't bare having it sit outside begging me to
drive it.

i have a meeting today at the capital (new jersey that is)and i have to drive
my acura legend......how boring!

Again, i'm in Trenton NJ.........

thanks in advance for all the valuable info.

Warren

1989 928S4, (GT)?
