Hi.  I have a 1980 928S Euro, and the trim around the rear quarter windows
is not the same on both sides of the car.  One side has all chrome trim, and
the other is about half chrome and half black.  (I can't figure that out.)
It seems to me that the black is the original trim, as there is no other
chrome on the entire car.  Regardless of what color it originally was, I
like the black trim better, and would like to change the trim to black on
both sides.  (Here's the question)  Do all your cars have the same window
trim regardless of year/model?  Do some of you have black trim there?  How
tough is the replacement procedure?  
We finally got snow here in Wis. and I can't stand not driving the shark!  I
drove it home and parked it for the winter.  Just enough to whet my appetite
so this winter has rapidly become a period of unrelenting torture.  I gotta
move south.
