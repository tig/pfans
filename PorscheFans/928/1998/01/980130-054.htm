"I'm wanting access to the area on a 1986 under the intake manifolds.  I
want to change out the vacumn lines, they are very brittle.  And I need
to change a hose from the Idle adjuster to the intake manifold.  Can the
Big central intake tube off of the Throttle body be removed easily or
does the whole intake manifold need to be removed to do this?"

I've done this a couple of times on my 85 which is, as far as I know, 
identical. Its pretty straight forward. The manifolds do not have to come 
off. You will obviously have to take off the plenums. Just loosen up the 
hose clamps, disconnect the breather tube on the left side, remove the 
bolts at the rear that hold the exhaust sniffer tubes (I think that's 
what they are) with the rubber caps in place and a reasonable tug will 
pop them right off. At this point you need to loosen the hose clamp that 
holds the "big central intake tube" to the throttle body and it will pull 
off also. Its got a bit of an offset to it so it may need a wiggle or two 
to get it out. Depending on which direction the clamp bolt heads are 
pointing, long extensions and or real skinny hands will be useful. In 
fact you almost certainly will have to remove the air box and MAF sensor 
to get at them. That's about a 5 minute job actually and is obvious and 
logical enough to do that you probably don't need me to tell you how. 
You'll probably find it a little more awkward to put back. Because of 
that offset its just about impossible to get a push in the right 
direction to get the thing back into the rubber hose. I assume you will 
have taken the hose off as well to give you some more working room and 
the best way I found to get it back together is to clamp the hose to the 
throttle body first then get the "big central intake tube" (even though 
that's wonderfully descriptive I wonder if there's a shorter official 
description?) into position as best you can and with a little bit of 
downward pressure on it, run a skinny screwdriver or similar around and 
between it and the hose which will coax the hose to pop round the outside 
of it and in it will slide ( said the .......). Well that sounds about 
the way I envision it in my mind, I hope it make sense the way its 
written. Good luck. Oh, one other word of advise, your going to find 
yourself stretching pretty far to get down to those vacuum lines so put 
something on the fenders to protect them and don't forget they're 
aluminum and quite thin at that. Also, if this is the first time you've 
been in this area of the engine you will almost certainly find that the 4 
way rubber vacuum trees are shot. If they look OK bend them a bit and I 
bet they come apart in which case you will have saved yourself the effort 
of doing this job again.
