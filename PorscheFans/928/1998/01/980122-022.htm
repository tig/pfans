<<just think to yourself and put yourself in their shoe's, what makes
you nervous? Approaching a car that may have been speeding, and not able
to see inside?>>

What I've never understood is why exactly does speeding make you a
dangerous criminal?  (Most bankrobbers and muderers don't escape in
928's at mach 1.)  Couldn't someone running a stopsign shoot a police
officer just as easily?  Or for that matter, some guy walking down the
street?  It's a very poor excuse (window tinting & speeding) for police
officers to use when what thjey really should be saying is "revenue
collection."

Hello list, I have 2 sony cd changers for sale, both sony 10 disks, one with
custom file, includes all mounting and hook up hardware. If bought in a pair
includes the apapter to hook up both to your sony radio, and if you don't have
a sony radio it includes the fm freq. modulator so you can keep your existing
radio.

As for lacation for cd changer(s), why not just put them in the hatch area
under the luggage cover. That's where I kept mine and nobody can see through
the luggage cover.
