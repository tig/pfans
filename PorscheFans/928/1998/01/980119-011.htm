I think not. Although last summer at a driver ed session at Watkins
Glen, I noticed a puff of smoke from the left front of another 928
I was behind as he entered each turn. Looked like that wheel was
locking, but it seemed awfully consistent. Turned out that a hose
in the power steering circuit had developed a pinhole leak, and was
squirting a shot of fluid on the (hot) left front brake every time
he turned the wheel. No replacement parts were to be found on a
Saturday afternoon in upstate NY, so he salvaged the weekend by 
just cutting the belt to the power steering pump. Said that the
steering was heavy but tolerable on the track, but had some 
doubts that he could ever park it that way.

As to your real question, I have no idea what the long term effects
of no PS would be, but it seems like a bad idea. Hey, it's a
Porsche, not some junker! Incidentally, make sure that the rest
of the system is well flushed when you replace the rack; the
potential is there for ruining the new one with debris from the
old one.
