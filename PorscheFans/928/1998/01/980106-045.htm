Jason,

Mine sets off car alarms in the basement at work, too, and I am certain
it is just the rumble.  Neat feeling, huh?

I believe I read somewhere (probably in the owner's manual) that the
electronic fuel injection/computer chip can give off frequency signals that
will set-off garage door openers.  Has anybody ever experienced the same
problem with car alarms?  Every morning when I drive in to the parking
garage at work, several car alarms start going off as I drive by, the same
thing happens when I start my car in the evening.  I would like to think
that the low frequency rumble of the 928 exhaust is so earthshaking that it
wreaks havoc on the motion sensors of some car alarms, but I have to think
that it is probably related to something else.  Perhaps they are trembling
due to their fear of sharks?!  Anyone have a similar tale?
