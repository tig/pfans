I recently retired from Saudi Arabia, and shipped my '85 928S (US) back
from there. I had originally shipped it over in the summer of '90, after
purchasing it in Little Rock.  It managed to get on the boat 2 days
before Saddam Hussein threw his monkeywrench into the works, and ended
up taking months to get to me...but I digress.

Saudi Arabia determines their value of any imported cars, regardless of
whatever price you paid for it. (I paid $23,500 for the car in June of
'90, and they charged me customs on $32,000). The going duty is 12%.
They confiscate your US registration when you clear customs, and there
is a "tech inspection" that costs about $75, during which you are
informed you may not bring a car in that has a catalytic converter (VERY
highly leaded gas over there), and occasionally they will not allow an
FM radio that goes over 107 MHz...something to do with National
Security.

Registration fees are about $260 for three years. The car must have a
"safety inspection" prior to registration renewal (about $20)...and that
pretty much is it.

Sales prices on used cars is determined by whatever the buyer and seller
agree on. I couldn't get $9000 for my 928 last March...but I sold my '78
Blazer with almost 150,000 miles on it and the fenders rusted through
for $2000!

Getting the car back was another interesting exercise...took nearly
three months to get it back into US spec...even though they only had to
put back the cat, Lambda sensor and filler-neck restrictor to "meet
specs." The Saudi government confiscated tehir registration when I
exported the vehicle, but I had made hotocopies, gotten official
translations and had it all notarized by the US Consulate before
returning, so I had only minimal explaining about why I did not have a
title when I got to this end.  Also, it seems thate 7 years of leaded
gas took its toll on the fuel system...but the engine is still running
fine. I think the chip may be acting up, and will get that checked out
later this winter...but compression is still good...belts and hoses are
ok, as I replaced them all about two years ago, and the current mechanic
says they check out fine (European Auto Technik, in north Houston, off
Rankin Road).

I didn't have it on the GT.  I have a picture of a GT with the GT designation
on it. The picture is on the service information booklet. The sticker has 928G
(on the same level with the ' T ' subscripted,( Like the ' 4 ' in 928S 4)

 With all this GT discussion, i thought i would ask:

I am having a 60k service at the local dealer and they are replacing the 2 cam
gears, and chain.. ..They say the teeth are worn and the chain might jump a
tooth..Is this routine at 60k or are they sellin me 2 cam gears that I don't
need??? Or is it a good idea to change the 2 cam gears anyway at 60k??

                   Thanks
