I have a grammar question: does your voltmeter work now or not? If not, 
then how were you able to set it?  :-)

More info on potentiometers (the $3 bag from Radio Shack). There are
two kinds, linear and audio tapers. The difference is that a linear
taper 100 ohm pot will have 50 ohms between the wiper and either end
when the dial is in the middle. An audio taper 100 ohm pot might have 25
ohms and 75 ohms for the same setting. For the voltmeter shunt you are
using the pot as a variable resistor and need about 40 ohms. If you
select the correct leg on a 500 ohm linear taper pot then you'll
probably do OK. Otherwise you'll have something that is very hard to
adjust and keep adjusted. For myself, I dug thru my resistor collection 
and hand selected a combination that was accurate enough. No more pot 
to wear out on my '83 928S.

If you really want to go for overkill, accuracy, and reliability, buy a
5 or 10 turn pot. Probably not from Radio Shack, I don't look there for
that kind of thing. I don't look for Porsche oil filters at Wal-Mart 
either.
