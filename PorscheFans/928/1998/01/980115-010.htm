Ed and/or any other folks in the No. Virginia area:

I live in Manassas, VA near the Northern Virginia Community College Campus
(NOVA).  On Saturdays and Sundays in the summer and fall I would normally
go out for a spin on my motorcycle, and would frequently drive back into
the Bull Run Business Park next to the NOVA campus.  Often I would notice
911s ripping around the NOVA satellite parking lot in what appeared to be
AutoCross sessions (practice or competition, I'm not sure).  Unfortunately,
I would normally arrive just as they were picking up the cones.  I was
wondering if anyone knows if these are sanctioned races or just a bunch of
guys flogging their cars for fun?  And whether there is a schedule
available so that I might actually get there in time to actually witness
one of these events?  Ed, I thought that perhaps it could be a Founders
Region-sponsored event and that you might actually know what is going on
out there.  Any info. would be appreciated.

See ya at P3 - might have the SO in tow  :-(
