	[snip]
	In connection with it I'd like to ask a question.
	I'm going to buy an 83 928s euro spec manual 928S this week. It
is very
	sraight and clean, loaded with extras, one can eat out of the
engine bay.
	The car looks extremely well cared for. Except a very small
parking lot
	stuff it seems to be very good. 
	The only problem that the car has  140k miles on the odometer.
Is it a
	problem at all? How much is it for the magnificent v8? 
	Could you help me what to check, what to look for before I buy
it. Shoul I
	stay away and look for lower mileage?

	thanks for the help.

My '83 928S has 199K on the odo and it is still running strong as ever.
As to the longevity of the engine, it all depends on the maintenance.
Oil change interval, the driving habits of the owner(s) etc.  Major
things to look for are timing belt and water pump, ball joint condition,
(has it been updated to the steel one instead of the aluminum), wheel
bearing, torque tube, 2nd gear synchro if 5-speed.  Just to mention a
few.  I suggest that you take it to a competent Porsche mechanic and get
an expert opinion.
