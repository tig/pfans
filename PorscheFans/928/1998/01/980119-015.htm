  You didn't say, but from the description, I'm guessing that your
  car is '84 or earlier.  If so, I believe the green struts are the
  optional Bilsteins.  Since Bilstein housings are a different diameter
  than Boge, this would explain why the spring perches wouldn't fit.
  FWIW, 928 Intl can supply the adjustable spring perches (and required
  spring plates) for a _significant_ savings over the price you paid; BTDT.
