     >Is there a trick to remove the electrical fan on S4 and newer 
     928? Does it require the removal of one or more of the radiator 
     oil line?

     I recently replaced one of my S4 radiator fans and had to remove the 
     entire support bracket with both fans intact. I disconnected the 
     upper trans. cooler line, removed the power steering reservoir, 
     disconnected the upper and lower radiator hoses, removed brackets 
     which hold the radiator in place, and the spacer between the A/C 
     condenser and the radiator.  In hindsight, the trick which finally 
     got the whole fan assemble out was removing the A/C spacer, which 
     allowed the now loose radiator to move forward, and to spray silicone 
     on all the rubbing surfaces and gently but forcibly wriggle the thing 
     out.  The good thing was it all went back in a lot easier than it 
     came out (gravity maybe).

     If there is an easier way I didn't find it.
