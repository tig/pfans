John White & David Schultz... both responded to my post regarding operation of
the hatch release, stating that their owner's manual clearly indicates that
the hatch can be released when "one door or both" are open.

Well, sure enough, so does MY owner's manual.  Obviously I can spell, but
can't read very well.

However, I was still puzzled by the fact that my hatch releases sometimes (not
always) when the doors are closed.  So, based on John's and Dave's info, I
went into the garage and determined the following regarding hatch operation:

1. Get in car, close door
     Key in OFF or ACC position:  hatch releases
     Key in IGN position:  hatch does not release AND can no longer   be
released with doors closed, regardless of key position, until door is opened
and then closed to reset hatch release lockout function.

2. Either door open, any key position: hatch releases.

The moral here is that the owner's manual may be telling the truth (like
Clinton), but there's more to the story than meets the eye.  BTW, I performed
the above steps several times to assure repeatability of operation, and I feel
resonably safe in saying that this is how the hatch is supposed to work.

So...the next time you pick up your significant other at the grocery store in
the rain (or want the bellhop to grab your bags) and want to pop the hatch
with the car running, just open the door and then pull the release...it should
work.
