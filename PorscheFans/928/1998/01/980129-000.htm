In the digest of december 10 1997:

I made the offer to Phil, and he suggested I make it to the brotherhood
as
well.  My day job is with Panasonic.  I am responsible for 36 different
product groups in a 10 midwestern state area.  One of those product
groups is
our new Digital Still Camera.  ( You can see it at www.panasonic.com )
It is
the Worlds Smallest Digital camera - about the size of a pack of Camels
(without filters).  It takes up to 96 pictures, 32 in Fine mode.  It is
Mac
and IBM compatible and comes with photoshop deluxe photo handling
software.
It has a 1.8" LCD panel in the back and runs on 2 nicads.  You can run
it on
AA's if your batteries die while at a auto show or something.

Since we are family, I wanted to offer them to the group at $368 +
freight.
Retai is $499.  If interested let me know.  I would have to work out the

logistics of payment, would prefer cashiers check, but could arrange M/C
or
VISA transaction.  Please understand, I am not a distributor - I work
for
Panasonic.  I don't stock this product, I would have to buy it from my
local
Distributor, and pass them through at cost.  They would come from Omaha,
NE.

If interested great - if not, not a problem.  I used mine to take
pictures for
Phils page - and it beats the hell out of waiting for photo's to be
developed,
then scanned just to get a TIFF file.  This does it all, and can
literally
have a picture on a web page in minutes.

Have Happy Holidays

Did you make a mistake and send several hundred lines of jokes to the digest?
I can't believe you would do that on purpose.  If so, please don't.  You may
have addressed this in later digest, as I am catching up from this last
weekend I don't know yet.  If so, then great.  But please don't do that
anymore.  I send out several jokes each day, as many people do, and if I sent
them to the list it would be easily twice as long.
