Well I dont want to burst anyones bubble on the list.. But look at 
me.. Im just a punk 21 year old kid with no college degree and I have 
a 928.. Now Im not saying its a nice S4 or GTS.. Its just a 78' with 
lotsa miles and a pretty paint job.. But its still a 928 and the 
average Joe doesn't suspect its not a nice 32v monster...
I have it because I always wanted one and I had the opportunity.. And 
I make better money than any 21 year old I know because of my vast 
array of technical knowledge.. But Im still a 'hoon'!

Speaking of me being a punk.. When I first started to re-do my 
interior.. I almost knew from the start that once I removed my rear 
seats I would never put them back in.. It was something I thought 
about for a long time.. I have since re-upholstered the rear center 
console and installed it and it looks rather nice.. But the empty 
rear seats dont look too great. I have had a couple of estimates done 
and have found a solution for everyones car stereo aspirations - DOW 
stereo and Mobilworks will make me a custom speaker enclosure out of 
fiberglass. (~$300 per box) They will mold it to the shape of the 
rear. flush with the 'floor' of the rear hatch compartment. The two 
things I am having them do - On the driver side, a speaker enclosure 
for a 10" JBL Woofer - On the passenger side, a molded AMP enclosure 
for the two AMPS I am running. Currently they are consuming the whole 
of the spare tire compartment. I dont plan on putting a spare tire 
back in as I have AAA to flatbed me to a tire shop, but I like having 
the weight closer to the absolute center of the car - and having it 
molded to the car to discourage those kids who think that I go to 
work every day from 9-6 to buy THEM car stereo equipment. (I have had 
3 complete systems stolen to this date.. Welcome to San Diego)
