Welcome to Austin! We have a large (per capita) 928 following in this
town and thought you might be interested in joining us for an occasional
get-together. Take a look at

    http://www.wolfeden.org/928-list.html

for information on the Texas mailing lists. It is on these that we
organize local and regional activities. There is a driving school event
at Texas World Speedway coming up in February. We may have something a
little closer to home too.

I apologize for the distinct lack of activity on the DFW and Texas lists,
but the word seems to not have spread very effectively and the holiday
season always slows things down. The lists were set up with the attendees
(and future attendees, hint hint!) of the Dallas mini-frenzy in mind,
but anyone is welcome to join.

If you get down to it, we can suggest local mechanics. James, Elliot,
David Gross and I have been very happy with ours.
