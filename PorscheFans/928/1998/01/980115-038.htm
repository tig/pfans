Say goodbye to your bearings and cams.  You will NOT get sufficient
protection from a 0W30 in these areas, and these items will wear out
very fast.

I think piston ring-to-wall is not a problem, though...

Hey Fans -

I have a mint condition, 1982 928S which I have just about completed restoring
at a cost of around $30,000.  One of two or three things left to do on the car
is replace the rear hatch lock/latch because it has this annoying squeak when
I hit any bump.  My Porsche dealer has had a new one on order for about 7
months now and I am getting really pissed off.  My idea today was to take a
latch off of a salvage car and have it re-keyed to my car.  So, two things -
1. If anyone has a perfect condition hatch lock for sale, let me know, and 2.
If anyone has the re-keying procedure for that lock, please send it to me.
Also, a couple of other things:  1. does anyone know if I could install the
power rear hatch lift in my '82?  2. Has anyone installed an alarm system with
keyless entry that is compatible with the factory alarm and the screwy
doorlocks which lock and unlock themselves whenever they decide to?  3.  Has
anyone installed a speaker setup which fits in the factory locations behind
the original perforations in the door and rear quarter panels, as well as a
hiding spot for a CD changer?

THanks,
