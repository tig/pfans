Hey Stephane!!!

I like your web page!!!  Always good to see more 928 Info on the web!!!

Thanks for the comments!!!  Are you in St.Louis?

Just to recap here is the list of parts that you said that I would need to
replace:

- water pump
- thermostat, front and rear O-rings
- Timing belt
- Tensioner boot and Gasket

Any others?

I have a daily driver and if I find that I need a part when I am in the
middle of a repair, I'm walkn' or rentn' a ride.  So, I like to have it all
when I start.

What about the tensioner itself?  Or, does the boot effectively make this a
new part.

Peace
