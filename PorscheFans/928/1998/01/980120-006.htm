Hi all,
        I was told by a friend that Steven Speilberg had bought seven
928's for his wife in different color combo's so she would have a
different color for each day in the week. Does anyone know if this is
true? My friend swears he read this in Road and Track or another car mag
in 1994 or 95.

I also have talked to Doug Flutie (the former BYU/CFL and now Buffalo
Bills qb) about his 928, He bought a Black on red 88 s4 with 50,000
miles on it about a year ago in the Boston area.
