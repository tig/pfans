Here's the info I got when I called PCNA 800# yesterday. The first thing
the rep did was read back to me that the VIN was for a 1986 928S4 2dr
coupe. S4???? I told the rep S4s came out in 87 - he double checked and
said yes - this was indeed true - it must have been a data entry error.
PCNA system had date car left Germany, arrived Charleston, SC, name of
dealer and date dealer took delivery, and date car was sold to first owner.
However, they did not have MFG date. 
Regarding options, here's where it gets interesting. My car has 40% LSD,
special order "Champaign Leather" interior, and "special sport chassis".
When asked for details, I was told special sport chassis option consisted
of 17" wheels, sport shocks and stiffer chassis. 17" wheels???? Stiffer
chassis????? Whats up with this?? I did check the shocks the other day out
of curiosity, and they are the light blue Boge gas shocks. I think PCNA has
some inaccurate info in their system regarding the 928. The reps don't seem
to know much about the cars either as far as general product knowledge
goes. However, I did find out the car is still its original color!
