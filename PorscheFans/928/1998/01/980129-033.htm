The relationship between "aerodynamics" regarding drag, "aerodynamics"
regarding lift,  and weight (mass) in regards to gravity and inertia: (an
amateur explanation...)

In this case we are discussing lift I think, so it's fairly simple to see
that when lift exceeds mass, gravity is overcome and the car 'flips'.  If
your car happens to have front downforce instead of lift due to
aerodynamics,  the mass becomes a factor only where it is combined to make
the total load on the front of the car higher.  Often cars that have front
lift experience transitional instability as the angle of attack increases,
increasing the amount of lift available.  This accelerates the flip, subject
to it's effect on that given mass.  There are some weight transfer issues
too, where as the front of the car lifts some of the weight is transferred
to the rear of the car.

Lift at the rear causes some interesting effects.  Most obvious is the loss
of traction to accelerate the car.  Less obvious is the potential for uneven
thrust relative to the axis of the car and the total drag vector.  With no
lateral support (need those sport seats here...) for the back of the car,
it will tend to pass the front unless some other force prevents it.  The
naked 928 must tend to lift at the rear, hence the various spoilers and such
that have been installed as the top speeds rose.

I suspect that the Camaro used in the original illustration was subject to
rear lift rather than front,  and that the 'flip' was more likely a "roll".
This is only speculation, though.  Most drivers, when presented with a
lifting rear situation, tend to "lift" their foot from the throttle, and
"roll" it onto the brake, if you get my 'drift'.  (--I-- get to do the humor
part... such as it is.)


WRT "aerodynamics" regarding drag, the mass or inertia becomes a factor only
where it takes a certain amount of force to accelerate a given mass at a
given rate.  If all your force is consumed to overcome aerodynamic drag,
you have nothing left to accelerate the mass.



One of the better genius minds in the group might want to correct me on some
of this.  ==8-)
