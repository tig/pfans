Facts:

- I used Slick 50 in a race Lotus Seven in 1983/84 and was impressed with it
- I bought a Lotus Esprit in 1986 and treated it with Slick 50 also
- I have absolutely no sense of smell - was born that way (the reason I tell you
  this will become obvious in this story)

Events:

I was taking the Esprit in to get serviced on a very hot Summer's day and the
water pump failed.  The temperature sender is high up in a water pipe and began
simply measuring air temperature, so I didn't notice all my coolant had been
left in a neat puddle on the road.  The oil pressure guage was intermittently faulty 
and was one of the things to be fixed during the impending service, so when I 
noticed it had dropped to zero I didn't think much about it.

I didn't smell the engine getting hot for the reason outlined above.  My first clue
was when smoke came billowing in the gear-lever hole.  I stopped at the side
of the road and tried to remove the engine cover to see what was wrong, but it
was too hot to touch.  I walked the remaining distance to the workshop.

Lots of things had melted.  Both cam-cover gaskets were destroyed, as indeed
were my Christmas plans.  I left the car there and went home to cry a bit. The
phone rang that evening.  They'd put some water in, changed the oil and started
the car, after a few basic checks.  A couple of gaskets were useless but it was
showing full compression and decent oil pressure.

The mechanic was a Ferrari mechanic and totally anti-Slick 50, but his comment
was that "when the car became oil-cooled SOMETHING saved the engine."

What does the list think?  (After mentioning Slick 50 on IRC last night the reaction
I got made me feel I should be ringing a bell and shouting "Unclean" as I walked
around.)  I don't use Slick 50 in the 928.
