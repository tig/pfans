I heard there are some aftermarket pumps to do just that, and I former 
co-worker had them on his cars. (I don't recall the pump's maker).
When we bought the Subaru for my wife, I asked about having the dealer 
install just such a device. But when they said that it would void my 
new car warranty, I decided not to.

This is one question I've often pondered myself.  At least they could
pre-oil the camshafts.

Hi Fans,

Just out looking for input about the Ungo Box Pro Security System.  I saw it
advertised in Automotion and thought I would see what you folks think!  Does
this system work with the factory alarm?  Does it have keyless entry?  How
would it affect my power doorlocks which seem to have a mind of there own?
Where do you mount an alarm speaker in a 928?  Let me know if you have any
info, thanks in advance.
