This may be of interest.

On Sunday night last week thieves broke into the home of a local 928GTS
owner and, while he slept upstairs, searched until they found his car keys
and then stole the car.  It's '95, one of the last ever produced, and he likes
it very much!

The police came back with some very interesting comments.  Firstly, they
were pretty sure it had been stolen-to-order.  They know of two shady people
around at the moment with 928s with broken engines, one an S4 the
other a GTS.  They confirm that there is a black-market for parts for these
cars, particularly as purchase prices have dropped where parts prices haven't
and it's very easy to get in a situation where you spent all your money on a
car and are now faced with a $15,000 repair cost.

They also mentioned a practice which is happening where someone will
import a luxury car with either broken mechanicals or none at all from
Japan or Britain.  They will then steal a local car, paint the stolen car to
match the import and transfer all the numbers across from the import to the
stolen car.

In short, by Thursday they figured his GTS would be in considerably smaller
pieces.

On Friday morning someone spotted a car covered in bushes in some trees
at the back of a field in West Auckland.  It turned out to be a carefully parked
and safely locked up 928 GTS.  It's been backed through a fence, breaking a
rear light, and the rear tyres are worn completely bare.

The police figure that their inquiries had made the car a bit hot and that the
thieves were planning to come back for it after a week or two.  It's currently
in at the dealership getting checked out.  I will find out from the owner just
what damage, if any, has been done to it.

It's made me start thinking of ways I can protect my car against theft by 
someone who has first stolen my keys!
