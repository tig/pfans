Hi Philip,
Tried for over a half-hour to get connected to the IRC Wednesday night and
could not get connected to the server. (sparrow.winz.co.nz) 
I just figured there was a server problem, till I saw your post regarding the
Slick 50, etc. .....oh well ....got hooked to the sparrow server just now, no
problem...... go figure.

>What does the list think?  (After mentioning Slick 50 on IRC last night the
>reaction I got made me feel I should be ringing a bell and shouting "Unclean"
as I >walked around.)  I don't use Slick 50 in the 928.

Hehehe, very funny, actually, I must confess I'd used it when it first came
out in a 71' Kingswood Wagon. (didn't I read you had one of these too?.....if
so, that's kinda wild, as we have apparently been on similar car-paths, what
with a Kingswood, the 535, and of course, the 928)  It seemed to make it run
better, but nowdays, being more informed, I don't use it, or any other snake
oil.
We don't need no stinkin' snake oil.!    
(leaving the rest of the "Pink Floyd" lyrics, for you to fill in as your
punishment for being "Unclean") ...... (Is this more like the reaction you
were hoping for Philip?)  :)  
(Hey, look at the bright side, it's gotta be easier to rhyme-to than 
"de-weissachization")       :)   

Best Regards,
Greg S.
