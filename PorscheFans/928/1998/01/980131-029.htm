Technically oriented may enjoy helping me with this one:
Car is currently hard to start when cold (85 S).  Turns over and fires
but never really catches- will start readily if 1/3 to full throttle
applied while cranking.  I assume its flooding/loading up? Seems to
run O.K. once its going.
Just had t-belts done and was told that the throttle cable was
misadjusted holding throttle open.  After shop adjusted to "proper"
specs, the car always idled high after warmed up, until I "blipped"
the throttle.
Could this be a T.P.S. or Aux. air valve problem?  DO the injectors on
these systems ever need to be cleaned (i.e. under pressure)?

**Good news is that the association of my rear wiper and accelerator
pedal has, apparently "healed itself".  No -effort but certain to
recur, I'm sure.  Probably a product of the recent torrent of
precipitation here in the N.E. that has my neighbors chipping in to
build a yacht (modeled after a Lincoln Navigator- ugh!)***

1967 Pontiac G.T.O., 4 spd., Tri-power, Ram-air, heads/cam, etc.
1985 928S, 5 spd., Blk & Blk, Jacobs, Autothority, K&N, etc.
