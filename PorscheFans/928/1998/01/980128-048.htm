I have to share this...

I saw an ad in local want ad paper:  1989 Porsche 944 Turbo "S", 59K =
miles, red/black, loaded with all options, stored winters, excellent =
condition.  $11900/obo.

The minute I saw the ad I picked a phone and inquired about it.  I asked =
most of the common questions one would ask,=20
i.e.,=20
Me: are you the original owner ?=20
Him: No, my sister was.

Me: Has the car been in an accident ?=20
Him: No, it's in immaculate condition.

Me: Do you have all of the service records
Him: Yes

Me: Can I see it today?
Him: No, I'm very busy w/school. =20

Me: When can I see it ?=20
Him: Call me back next week.

Me: Ok, bye

After several attempts I got a hold of him a week later...

Me: can I see the car?
Him: Bad news, some guy had offered to buy the car for $12000 over the =
phone.

Me: you told me to call you back at this time, day, and date...
Him: sorry.

Me: alright, bye.
Him: bye.


Another week went by (yesterday)...I got a msg in my voicemail box:
Him: Hi Sleu, if you're still interested in that Porsche it's here.  =
Give me a call.

Thinking to myself, if this car is in the condition he described, the =
first person that looks at it will buy...

I finally got a date to look at this car, (mmm), today, I left work =
early (5:30), sat in a rush hour traffic on route 128 South (technology =
highway), an hour later I arrived at his place.  First glance from the =
rear, mmm, beautiful (thinking...):  here are the real conditions: 1. =
Been repainted poorly.  2. Definitely been in an accident, front gaps =
around the hood, headlights were unsightly misaligned.  3. All four =
wheels were filled with brake dusts. 4. Engine bay was filthy...thinking =
to myself again, that does not look like a 59K mile car...and I told him =
that too, not in those words. 5. Front left wheel was sitting a little =
crooked.

To say the least I was disappointed.  I told him "this car did not =
merely come close to the descriptions you gave me over the phone, I wish =
you had been more honest with me.  Good luck, bye" . =20

The moral to this story:  It doesn't matter how hard he twists his words =
to spice up that car, it won't change a thing about how the car =
looks/drives. Nothing can overcome the truth.=20

I'll find my dream 928 someday...

Thanks for listening.

Sleu
