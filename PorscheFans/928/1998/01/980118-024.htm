Greetings,

I have an 85S that is in good mechanical shape, but an electrical 
nightmare. I've had little electrical troubles since day 1 (in 1989), 
even a small fire in the light in front of the sunroof (quickly 
resolved...thank God). My latest can probably be helped by one of you 
folks, since I know no better pros. As I was attempting to wipe my front 
window while the car was still off, the wipers stopped right in the 
middle, and there they have stayed. My fuse manual doesn't show a fuse 
for the windshield wipers, and I don't know what the relay # is. If 
anyone can help me, with either a relay # or a fuse #, please do so. 
Also, if you know how much the relay costs, please inform the group.
Until then, if you see a navy 85 in Miami with the wipers squarely in 
the middle of the windshield, do say hello.

thanks,
jojo
