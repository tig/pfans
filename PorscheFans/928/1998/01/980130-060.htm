Pretty funny.  Looks like either a significant portion of the list has
had as 
long a work week as I have, and are feeling a bit giddy, or else
somebody's
been switching your Folger's crystals for hallucinogenic mushrooms.

Hell, I hope I spelled "hallucinogenic" right, and didn't misplace any
commas....

Have a great weekend, shark people!

(For the edification of our plethora of Kiwis and other country folk,
Folger's is
a US brand of instant coffee crystals, and their commercials have people
switching their regular coffee grounds for Folger's crystals, and all
gasp 
in amazement as they can't tell the difference.)
