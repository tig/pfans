Probably like a new engine, plus the (considerable) labor to remove and
replace. Splashing a good slug of water into a car's engine air intake
(often one or more snorkels placed forward and fairly low, to get cool
air straight from the grille or other opening in the front of the car)
will generally allow that water to be drawn into at least one
cylinder.<br>
<br>
When the intake valve(s) of that cylinder close and the piston comes up,
everything in the engine stops NOW, bending or breaking con rods, cranks,
and other valuable parts. You can rebuild such an engine, but dealer
logic is to replace the long block to minimize labor charges.<br>
<br>
However, all that aside, BMW looks to have taken the lead from
Mercedes-Benz and Porsche in outrageous prices for parts.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, if you must ford a deep puddle, drive SLOWLY to avoid drowning
your engine.

Looking for a windshield to fit an '85 928.  I cracked mine installing a dash
pad/cover.  Anyone parting with a 928 windsheild in perfect condition at a
reasonable price?  I'll pay the shipping.
