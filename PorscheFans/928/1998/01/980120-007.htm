>>My friend, being a mechanic, thinks that he can get it running and
looking half way decent for a two or three thousand dollars.=A0 I've
bought and sold a lot of 928s but they were always in good =
condition.=A0
I'd like whatever input any of you might give.=A0 The junkyard guy =
wants
2500.00 for the car and my friend thinks he might get it for 21 or 22
hundred.
> =A0
RUN, BOY, RUN!

I'd estimate he's got something in the range of $5K-$7K worth in just
parts to get it in good shape again, even if he uses some rebuilt/used
bits.  Interior bits aren't cheap.  Paint ain't cheap.  There's a heck
of a lot of wiring and hoses and vaccuum lines and valves and =
reservoirs
that a fire would force you to replace.

For the cost of the parts alone, you could probably get a good runner.

I bought my 1982 for $6000, knowing I needed a partial repainting, some
leather repair, and new brakes.  I'm now in it for about $9500.
