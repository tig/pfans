Anybody in the Austin area want to get a laugh? Look in the statesman today
@ the 81 928 with an "S" designation located @ Austin Infiniti. I drove by
and looked at the car, which looked as though it had had the snot knocked
out of it. It has the regular seats (non-sport) dial wheels and dam & fin.

 Does anyone know if this constitutes an "S" designation. I know I may be
asking for a flame, but I thought "S"'s had different seats and wheels that
year...anyone, anyone?
Car had 54K but looked terrible. 

To top it off, they're asking $15,995 for the car. I informed the salesman
he had a firm grip on that one, because there are two 87 S4's in the paper
today for $995 less money.
