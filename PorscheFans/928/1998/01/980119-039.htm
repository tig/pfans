Hi, everyone.

I recently bought 86 S and became a proud Porsche owner!
Owning a Porsche has been my dream since I was small.

Anyway,
I'm looking for a good mechanic in Providence, RI (Rhode Island) area.
If you happen to know good mechanics around this area please let me know.

Also, Does anyone know how expensive to replace the 928S's clutch?
I was told that 928's one is hydraulic(?) and no way to adjust what so ever...
Mine unfortunately needs new one already.

Thanks in advance.

CH

P.S. please excuse my english. my 1st language is not english.

Thanks for all the help on the starting problem.  I put in a new battery and
drove it for a while. It was the first time I drove it in about 3 months and
it is running great! The only problem is that I can't hook up the radio.  I
need to find the right wires under the consoule to connect them. The problem
is that the PO had an alarm which I removed, some cheap alarm, but seemed to
connect it to the radio leads so I need to find new ones. But at least  I got
to drive it today!
