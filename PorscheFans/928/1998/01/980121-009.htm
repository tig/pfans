>>My friend, being a mechanic, thinks that he can get it running and
looking half way decent for a two or three thousand dollars.  I'd like
whatever input any of you might give.   The junkyard guy wants 2500.00
for the car and my friend thinks he might get it for 21 or 22 hundred.

RUN, BOY, RUN!

Michael Cottam:

<<I'd estimate he's got something in the range of $5K-$7K worth in just
parts to get it in good shape again, even if he uses some rebuilt/used
bits.  Interior bits aren't cheap.  Paint ain't cheap.  There's a heck
of a lot of wiring and hoses and vaccuum lines and valves and =
reservoirs that a fire would force you to replace.>>

My experience tells me Michael is accurate in his estimate, and fire
certainly can hide a lot of misc stuff needing replacement.

<<For the cost of the parts alone, you could probably get a good runner.

I bought my 1982 for $6000, knowing I needed a partial repainting, some
leather repair, and new brakes.  I'm now in it for about $9500.>>

I am in the midst of this experience.   I got mine priced 'right'
knowing the extensive project ahead.   A Porsche mechanic echoed Mr.
Cottam's remarks after detailed inspection.

Being a life-long hard-headed masochist, I did it anyway!   The car is
about 90% where I want it to be - a very close to stock, high-quality,
'true' appearing 79 Euro that can be driven daily or as a fair weather
tension buster.   At this point I'm around $10k with another $1k or so
to get it to my satisfaction.

But, my whole objective was to learn the car and to bring a heap back to
respectibility.   Financially, it doesn't make sense - but it is worth
the 'investment' in my own experience, knowledge, and creative needs.
What can I say?   How do you put a price on 'mental' investment?    Not
everyone's cup of tea - just my 928 cents worth.   And what's the price
of endorphin therapy compared with the 'freebie' whilst slicing through
the five speed on a twisty road............ahhhhhh....?
