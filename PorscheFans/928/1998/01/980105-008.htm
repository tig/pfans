Some rdiator can be repaired. You should make a few call to
a local radiator shop and confirm this.  If you can, the repair
could be cheap, if not, call DEVEK and ask for a replacement 
radiator or 928 international for a good used one.

You have all probably seen the phantom 
(cutaway) view of the 928 in your owner's manual.  
I have also seen the same image (blue S4) on one
of the 928 websites.  Does anyone know where I 
would be able to buy a poster size version suitable
for framing?
