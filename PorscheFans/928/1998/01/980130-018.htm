Exactly.  Note that the metal-to-metal contact can reappear under two
conditions:

(1) engine very hot, e.g. racing conditions, and the oil isn't able to
maintain
its film
(2) very high shear on the oil surface

This is why a good synthetic doesn't show much of a horsepower gain
on a dyno on a warm engine, but on a hot engine does much better.  On
a warm engine, you have no metal-to-metal with either type of oil.

One property of many of the synthetics is that it takes a HELL of a long
time for the oil to "run off" the parts completely, even when hot.  So
you've
drained the oil, but you still will have some protective film for a
while (minutes?
hours?  I don't know).  I've seen a Harley drag bike tranny with Red
Line gear
oil on it sit in a box over a year and still have a thick coating on all
surfaces,
for instance.  I believe this is a property of most synthetics, not just
Red Line,
but I might be wrong about that, since the different synthetics are made
from radically different base stocks.
