If I am not mistaken, the plug in the 86 is the same as the 85 and there
is no fancycomputer that can be plugged in.  There is a little "gizmo"
that looks like a round
relay with 2(?) LED and a switch on top that can be plugged in.  If the
computer has
something to say, you will get some sort of morse code signal which I
never seen
any explanation in the service manual.  In other word, I think the thing
is useless and
that you are on your own with the debugging.

Now, if you had an 87 and the $5,000 computer that can read the code,
its
a totally different story...
