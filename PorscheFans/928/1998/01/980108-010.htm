	Will a car run with the battery completly dead or missing?



	Well here is a true story:  Before my 928 I had a Ford T-bird Turbo 
coupe, driving along and it dies.  It won't restart, dead battery( really 
dead ), the alternater had quite and the battery gave it's all.  The car 
behind me, this nice lady asked if I needed a jump.  I am thinking what 
good will that do?  But I said sure!  It started!  Now for the odd part, 
I drove it for 10 minuites to Sears!  The whole way I am thinking it's 
going to die like now.....   Well at sears they checked the battery and 
alternater, battery dead but charged OK alternater out put 0 amps.  So 
after a quick dinner/battery charge raced over to the parts store, bought 
a alternater and tools.  The parts store was closing, had like 10 
minuites.  Had to buy the tools ripe out the old one, under warrenty, 
bring in the old one.....   It's dark but I am parked under a light, of 
course we made the movie.

	The next day had the same problem, lifetime warrenty alternater 
($30.00), but not nearly the same luck getting it home.  Of course they 
gave me another alternater, then I figured out why the in dash Amp meter 
didn't work, well then I never had another problem.

	My old Ford Escort would eat alternaters to but that stopped after I 
added a in dash voltmeter!  That car went thru 8 life time alternaters!  
One turnned black!

	It' to bad we can't get lifetime warrenty parts for Porsches,  
practically every wear item on that T-bird had a lifetime warrenty!  
Brake pads eveything, hey these wore out!

		I am a Mechanical Engineer those electrons baffle me, just when I think 
I understand something, well maybe not.....
