James,

I have driven both, and it boils down to whether you like smoldering blondes
aggressive redheads, or insatiable brunettes.    They will all scratch your
itch.
Performance-wise, they are not all that far apart.    The 928 comes on sooner
and will take you to insane speeds.   The 930 comes on later and will take you
to insane speeds.   The 928 is a FAR better handling car which feels much
more secure and which will never back you into a tree at 130.   The 930 is
light and sporty and has a completely different feel.   In terms of looks, they
are both stone cold beautiful, but you might not like my wife and I may not
like your girlfriend.    

Politically, much of the Porsche-purist community (whatever the hell that is)
will sneer at your front engined water pumper.  Economically they are both
expensive, and the 928 will depreciate $1,296 in the time it takes to write this
post.    Maintenance may be a wash.   Most of the 930 is more bulletproof than
a 928, but when you have to replace a turbo or an exhaust you will wish you
had a 924!  

I currently own an elderly 928 and love her.  She is more versatile and
practical
than a 930, but I admit to having gotten laid because of a wonderful 79 930
that had magnetic guards red paint and a sexier tail than I have.

Drive both.   See which one causes the most/best dreams.

Dave
