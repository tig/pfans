Greetings Phellow Phans,

I would like to announce that my 928 is for sale.  The car is dark
metallic gray with a black leather interior; both in great condition.
It has been 
professionally updated with original Porsche 928S4 bumpers and wings
making it look like a '90
S4.  It is in great shape and only has 75,900 miles.  You can take a
good look at it at the following site:
