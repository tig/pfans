> '87 928S4 that they claimed belonged to Larry Holms
I'd ask to see proof if one were to buy it on that basis.  I read in
Autoweek that celeb owned cars do seem to get above their value at
auction, so if true, it could be a good deal.  

I'm reminded of a seinfeld episode where George buys a Lebaron because
it belonged to "John Voight", a famous actor.  Of course it ends up it
as not "the" John Voight.

I live in Easton, PA which is where Larry Holmes lives.  My bank is in
one of his buildings (he owns several) as is his main business office.
One day last summer when I came out of the bank, I found him admiring my
928 which was parked by the door behind his reserved spot.  

We talked a bit about cars a bit before he had to go.  He is a car fan.
From his comments and questions, I got the impression that he did not
ever own a 928.  Perhaps he was just trying to get my unbiased opionons
about it, I don't know.  

He did mention "driving a Ferrari for awhile", but I'm not sure whether
he actually owned it or not.  Perhaps Don King lent it to him?  BTW, His
current ride was a big black S class Mercedes.  No doubt perfect for
getting his family around.

<< To get new keys for a 928, you need to just give the VIN # to a Porsche
 dealer.  They will order the keys from Reno based on this and within a
 week or two you will have them.  Price was as reasonable as any 928
 part, especially so for such an exotic key, about $20 each.  The lighted
 head is sold separately, about $15-20 I think.  Not cheap, but much
 better than $200.

Is it possible to get keys made for a euro car in the US by the same method?
