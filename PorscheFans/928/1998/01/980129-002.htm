Check out www.devek.net and check their books there.  The 928 Performance
Portfolio is one of the books available there.  They also have some other
books with 928 stuff in them as well for your perusal, but there is not a
great deal on these fabulous cars.

Yes, you can backorder from Excellence as well.  Just get an issue of their
magazine (or let us know if you can't find one), and I or someone else can
post contact information for you on them.  They also have a few other
issues which have neat 928 articles in them as well.
