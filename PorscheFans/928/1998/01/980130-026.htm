Vince, I would like to be the first, maybe, in the unofficial poll of
who owns 928's on this list, to state that I own Phil Tong's old 1984
928s4vr. I currently drive it every day with no problems other than the
annoying torque tube noise. I think you're familiar with this car.
Everything works ! I've owned three other 928's, a 83s, 82 and a 79
which I sold to Mark and Susan at Devek (it's the black body shell
that's probably going to be their next super car). The 79 was fun to
drive, having headers and a five speed. Phil's old car is realiable and
has decent power. I paid $13,000 for the 83 back in 1989-90 (perfect
with low miles), $5,000 for the 79 (because it had mechanical problems,
supposedly), $6,000 for the 82 (in perfect shape), and $6,000 for Phil's
84s (with torque tube noise). I love these cars and always have the GTS
in the back of my mind as the next purchase, someday. I do most of the
basic maintenance, and I'm considering doing the timing belt, water
pump, and maybe the torque tube myself, although my time is important (I
golf too much).

Richard
