	>>I paid $8 for a Fram at a local store before I saw the ads.

	FYI, Fram moved production of some of their filters to a new
plant
	(SE Asia, I think) about 2 years ago, and quality control
suffered
	a bit.  Some problem with the threads was causing the filters to

	blow off under pressure.  Filters in question were motorcycle
	filters for a certain set of common bikes (Honda F2 and others).
	Result was a banning of Fram oil filters with many motorcycle
	racing organization.

	I never heard anything similar about any of their car filters,
but
	hey, I don't fly on airlines that crash a lot, whether or not
I'm 
	gonna be on the same kind of plane that keeps crashing...
