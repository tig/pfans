Happy 1998 everyone!
The SC400's are fantastic cars, no doubt, and depending on what your
priorities are, they are in many ways preferable to 928, but......... 
I had an encounter about a year ago with a beautifull dark green SC400. He had
invited me to a duel in downtown Lexington, Ky......As always, I tried to
declined, but he kinda pestered me over the next couple of stop lights. Then
he kinda chapped my ass when he asked what the horsepower of mine was, and I
told him 316 hp, to which he replied "yeah, this has 320 hp" (this was BS and
I knew it, as they have 250 hp stock, and there was no indication that it was
otherwise)
Anyway, I finally agreed to let him see what she'll do, but also told him I'd
prefer to go from a roll rather than just dump the clutch, because I'm not
into abusing my car in that manner. As we rolled from the light and I had just
snicked it to 2nd gear, he said "go" at the same time as he was hard on the
gas. He kinda caught me off guard and down on revs as he got a fender on me,
but ol' supercar would have non of it, and proceeded to have him for lunch. I
never had to come out of 2nd, and was easily way past him, then casually
waiting at the next light. He was embarrased to say the least, but hey, he
asked for it. 
Of course, it's not really saying much to beat an SC400, but there have been
others on the menu that were tastier. An LT-1 Corvette (from a roll) and a
Supra Turbo (highway) this summer were the tastiest of treats so far.   
You know, it's funny, but these cars are sneaky fast. Sometimes I think it's
not very fast at all, but it's deceptive. It just shows more when "compared".
FWIW, the SC300 with the manual transmission is actually a tick quicker 0-60
than the SC400. Both have very sweet motors and are very nice cars.
Actually, I'd love to have one, but alas, I am not so rich as to have both,
and must make do with a mere Supercar and a Toyota pickup.

Steve, 
Assuming your 86' 928 has the S4 four-piston fixed caliper brakes, (which
would mean it currently has an 18 bar unit in it) you could go to a 33, 45,
55, or 65 bar brake force regulator. (or you can remove it entirely)
After speaking with Kim several times earlier this fall, and Susan at Devek, I
opted for the 55 bar unit, and am happy with it. (to each his own)
It took a few days of research and phone calls, but finally got the part
number.
It's actually a 911 part and the part number is 964 355-305-10. Cost was about
$25.
It's difficult to get the information from a dealer, because all they can look
up is the part number and can't tell what switchover pressure goes with what
part number unless they get the part out and look at the stamped numbers on
the part itself.  
I was told that the 33 bar part number is 928 355-305-02 and the 45 bar part
number is 930 355-305-01. Best to see if you can find someone with the part in
stock to verify the switchover pressure and reduction factors correlate with
these part numbers though. Didn't get a 65 bar part number, but I believe it's
a 911 Turbo part also. 

Hope this helps,
Greg S.
