I did not get a chance to cast my vote the other day regarding the 930 vs
928. No Contest!  I love my 928.  As a matter of fact in April I am in the
market for a new car (of course I am garaging the 928S). I would not dare
sell it. I have thought about buying another 928 but I find it hard because
I like my present one so much. I have thought about a 911 but I balk on that
because of the mechanical learning curve. I come to find out I just like the
car I have. I am tossing and turning regarding what type of car to purchase.
I am leaning on buying another 928. My question to you guy is  what year
should I buy? I want to spend about $20,000 or less (I have to have a 32 v -
V8).

Speaking of "Selective enforcement" (police). The other day I was leaving a
client's site in Anaheim Hills, CA. I head toward home. I was traveling
toward the freeway entrance going about 47mph in a 45 mph zone. There were
pickups and all types of cars zooming by me (I get this often, comes with
driving a 928) at 55mph or more. This motorcycle cop (BREA is the town). is
following me and lettting  everyone else speed by. Luckily I always take a
glance in my mirror before pushing the speed limit.  I could not believe
this he followed me to the freeway entrance, I think he had a thing against
guys who drive Porsches.  Maybe my second car should be a pickup (2 928s, I
think I have died and gone to heaven).

You guy ever get these kids in Acura Integras and Hondas trying to race you.
I always give them a little head start and peek over at them when I am
passing by them, to see the frustration on their face when they are pounding
on their gas pedal HEHEHE.

Tim 928-4ever
1986 928s
19?? 928 S4 or GT - YOU TELL ME (I am so excited).
