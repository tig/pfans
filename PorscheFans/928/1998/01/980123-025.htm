>David received a parrot for his birthday.  This parrot was fully grown
>with
>a bad attitude and worse vocabulary. Every other word was an expletive.
>Those that weren't expletives were, to say the least rude.
>
>David tried hard to change the bird's attitude and was constantly
>saying polite words, playing soft music, anything he could think of to
>try
>and  set a good example...
>Nothing worked. He yelled at the bird and the bird got worse. He shook
>the
>bird and the bird got more angry and more rude.
>
>Finally, in a moment of desperation, David put the parrot in the
>freezer.
>For a few moments he heard the bird squawking, kicking, and screaming -
>then suddenly there was quiet.
>
>David was frightened that he might have hurt the bird and quickly
>opened the freezer door.  The parrot calmly stepped out onto David's
>extended arm and said: "I'm sorry that I might have offended you with my
>language and action and I ask your forgiveness.  I will endeavor to
>correct
>my behavior."
>
>David was astonished at the bird's change in attitude and was about to
>ask
>what had made such a dramatic change when the parrot continued:  "May I
>ask swhat the chicken did?"
