  I called the PCNA 800# a while ago to see what they had listed for the
  equipment on my car.  The rep told me that the "optional equipment" on
  my car was sport seats, full leather, and sunroof.  She also told me
  the car had option code 468 which is graduated tint windshield and green
  tint glass; I would have thought that that one was standard equipment.
