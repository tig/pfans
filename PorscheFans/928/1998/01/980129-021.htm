>>Question: Does anyone really know why the 928 is so heavy?

The 928 was designed as a GT car, not a hairy-edged raw sports
car like the 911.  The tradeoffs:

 - quieter (more sound-deadening materials)
 - stronger chassis
 - more luxury amenities

If you're building a competition car, additional weight has three main
negatives:  

(1)	slower acceleration (Mr. Newton says F = ma)
(2)	longer braking distances (also F = ma)
(3)	less cornering ability*

* although more weight DOES increase traction to a point, that traction
has to provide a lateral force proportional to the weight--and it's not
a 
very good tradeoff.

That's why race cars have everything pulled out of them that's not
essential.  That's also why titanium parts are so popular on race cars
owned by people with too much money--not only does it look cool,
but the same part is lighter for the same strength.  Ditto for 'glass
bodywork etc.
