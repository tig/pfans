Hi to All,
            I just had my oil changed on Saturday and when I first drove
the car on Monday night I was driving down the highway and heard
scrapping sounds whenever I hit a bump. I pulled off the highway and
into a gas station and that's when I noticed that the protective cover
underneath the engine was hanging down 2 inches from the ground. It is
obvious that the Bastard/mechanic that changed the oil didn't put the
cover on right or didn't screw it on tight. I do think that there is
damage to the cover but I am not sure how much because it was dark when
I looked, If there is damage are they responsible for replacing it?.
What would you do?.

Thanks,
J.Brown
