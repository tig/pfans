Leonard Zech begged:

> Will someone PLEASE sell me a copy of   ***  Project 928 ***
> Damned if I can find a copy of it!  HELP ME PLEASE!!!

Careful Leonard, it is demeaning to beg.
Have you tried Vasek Polak in CA?  They are authorized Porsche dealer
and advertise in Pano Excellence and other mags.  I saw their ad in
Panorama May 1997 for "Project 928" at $59.95 plus tax, shipping etc..
I bought several copies and resold the extras to 928ers.  Why not call
or fax and see if they will sell you one?  BTW, I am informed that the
Boxster book is also out-of-print already.

I echo somone else request to have MIME turned off on list posts.  

<<Total cost: about $300.00 Lost =

features: 0>>

What about that "feature" they call a spare tire?  

I have used mine on the last 928, and on the latest 928 that didn't come with
one in good condition, I specifically replaced it.  It WILL deflate back to
shape when you are done, and it will get you home when out of range of tow
truck and cellular tower.  But on the other hand, chances are you wont need
it.

Jim Harriger,
Brian Buxton,
Phillip Adamson,
Michael Cottam,
various others who know who they are,

Please, PLEASE, don't copy the entire series of messages to your reply.  It
clogs up the digest with several copies of the same text over, and over, and
over, and over again.  

Sorry for calling you all out.  I know there are plenty of other people that
do it too.  But it is one of the worst habits for listmembers to have.  

I don't know how all mail readers operate, however, if you highlight the
pertinent portion of the text before hitting your reply button, you will
usually only get that portion of the text in your reply message.  Try it.  And
if it doesn't work, maybe try using the delete key on the text to clean it up.
I know it takes longer, but I do it when I reply so that I don't have to blast
all that garbage out to over 1000 other people. 

Thanks for listening patiently,

Brian Robinson

hello fellow shark owners/dreamers.

Due to my interest in purchasing of an 87 S4 and having only room for three
cars in my driveway....I am putting mine up for sale.  The car has 89,131
original miles, is black/tan leather, has all options (except sunroof) and
needs some minor repairs.  I have oil analysis reports showing compartment
wear levels (which are very low).  Car is originally from Arizona and on a
scale of 1-10 is about a 7-7.5.  Car is complete but does need some work.  I
hate to sell it to someone who will just let it go to hell.....will sell for a
"right" price for the right buyer.....email me for more info. 

Thanks.
