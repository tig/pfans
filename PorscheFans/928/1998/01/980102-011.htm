Hello. I have been enjoying everybody's posts and learning a ton about the
care and feeding of my much loved 84 shark, 57K, automatic, ruby red
(really more maroon) with aftermarket "turbo" style wheels and 255/40/ZR17
Dunlop D-40 M2 rubber. I have owned a 59 356, 72 911"S" (fast and a little
scary) and a 78 SC targa. Just a couple of quick questions:
I gather that this tire size is a little large for the design of the rear
suspension and I need to consider "pinning" the axle. True? I haven't
noticed any odd wear and handling seems O K . I haven't pushed it REALLY
hard in the twisties yet.
I have noticed a "knocking" or "tapping" sound not unlike a hydraulic
lifter that has gone solid. I'm running Valvoline synthetic 10-30W and
pressure is good (pins the needle at all but high temp/idle) and the car
runs fine overall. The noise seems to be more prevalent at cool engine
temp.It also seems to be the loudest from 2k through 3.5k.
I have more questions but will leave room for others and ask later.
This is a great forum and I really appreciate any help anybody can provide!
I LOVE THIS CAR!!
