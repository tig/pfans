Hi all,
since I am being optimistic and winter seems to be on the decline around here,
I started to ponder the question of new tires.
My Dunlop D40M2s have seen too many seasons! After poking around the usual tire
dealer web sites, I pretty much selected the Falken ZE-502 Ziex. Does anyone
have
an opinion on these tires?
I don't need the ULTIMATE in handling, but like good grip. Wet performance is
important ( I DO drive in the rain). Long term wear is very important as well
since my budget is a bit fixed while back at college.

The Falken Ziex seems to meet my needs (available in the appropriate 17" size
at a price around $145/tire....a 300AA rating seems to imply MUCH longer wear
than the D40...and tread pattern is claimed to be wet weather friendly).

Thanks for any input,

David Schultz
