The engine likely hydrauliced(sp?) as they call it.  Water gets in the
cylinder, bends a few components sending something through the side
of the engine.  The dealer will likely want to replace the entire engine,
rather than mess around with pulling each part off to see what needs
replacing, etc.

We had a lot of this stuff around here this year with all the horrible
rain we had (B.C. Canada).  Check with your friendly insurance company,
ours in B.C. covers damage caused by water in the engine from flooded
streets or poorly designed streets.  Heck, ICBC even covered a 944T
that had a fuel hose split and burn the entire engine.  The repair cost
C$14,000 and they paid it without a whimper.
