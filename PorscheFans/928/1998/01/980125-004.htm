The tale of the parrot in the freezer reminded me of a story about a guy
whose wife was away on a trip to see her mother.  The guy decided to go out
to a bar for a few one night, and while there, he saw this huge, brightly
colored parrot sitting on its perch down at the end of the bar.  There was a
sign propped up against the perch:  Parrot for sale:  $5000.

After a drink of two, the guy asked the barkeeper what was so wonderful
about the parrot that it was worth 5g's.

"Listen," said the barkeep.  "That parrot gives the best blow jobs on earth.
Worth every penny, and if you don't agree, I'll double your money back."

Well, after a couple of more drinks, the guy plunked down the five big ones,
and took the parrot home.

A week later, the guy's wife arrived home from mothers.  She opened the
front door of her house and went in.  EVERYTHING was covered in flour.
There was flour on all the floors, on the window sills, on the lamps and
sofa.  Flour everywhere.

She stepped out into the kitchen, where the flour was about 2 1/2 inches
think on everything.  In the middle of the kitchen floor, covered in flour
was the parrot, and standing there, also covered in flour was her husband.

"What the hell is going on here?" the hysterical wife shrieked.

"Listen," said her husband calmly.  "I'm teaching this parrot how to make
biscuits, and when he learns how, you're history!"

Roger....suffering from cabin fever.....we are now getting heavy snow and
high winds ontop of our ice,snow,slush, ice mix......
