Like others have experienced, my 5-speed manual is slowly turning into a
4-speed. It's the usual notchy second gear. However it's getting better
after driving around for a while.
It's probably bad synchros but I have no intention of tearing it down,
change synchros, drive a couple of miles and the repeat that process
over and over. I recently had a major breakdown and had to change gear
box. The first box was the original ('82) and the current one is
something from '80 to '84.
Could you enlightened people out there tell me what would happen if I
tried to put a gear box from a S4 or a GT in my '82 S Euro? Would it
fit? Or from a '85-'86 S (with the improved synchros)?
