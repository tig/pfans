When you shift from 1 to 2 and would expect a grind, try holding the 
shift lever to the left, against the gates. You will feel the reverse 
gear lockout prevent you from going into reverse and cleanly guide you 
into 2nd.

If this technique prevents your grind then you have a broken $4 spring.
To get to it, the transmission has to come all the way out as its under
the top access plate. While you are in there go ahead and have somebody
do the syncros. The transmission needs a good flush as part of this flat
plate spring is floating around somewhere looking to do more damage.

If this technique works, then you are not grinding dog teeth, you are
grinding reverse. My '83 did this. The worst part was the damage it did
to the pinion bearings from metal shavings. Replacement was only
available as an assembly. Cost just under $600 for what looks like
tapered wheel bearings but of no standard size. And $500 to $600 for a 
new pair of reverse gears.
