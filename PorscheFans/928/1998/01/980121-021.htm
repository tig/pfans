Howdy All!!!

Yep!!! it is time for a timing belt on the 1986 32-valve S.

I replaced my T/tube earlier this year and although it was most time
consuming mechanical work that I have ever done, but it was just mechanical
work and it was FUN!!!

So... I am thinking about replacing the timing belt myself.  Any comments,
suggestions, pitfalls.

A few questions:
-  I get my manuals this weekend, but I have heard of a need of a special
tool for tensioning the belt after everything is back in place.  Anyone in
the St.Louis area have one of these tools that they might be willing to let
me rent/borrow???
-  How much time can I expect this job to take?
-  What is the recommended service life of the chains that link the cams
together in each head?  This is the 100,000 mile timing belt, so I think
that It might be good to replace those too.
-  My car is on its original water pump... Looking for whether I should
replace that just for posterity sake while I am in there.  Comments...

Thanks, and any other advice would be appreciated!!!
