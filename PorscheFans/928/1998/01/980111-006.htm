I've been trouble-shooting my new (new to me, that is) '88 928 S4, item
by item. Today's hot issue is the antenna that's in the windshield
glass. Most of the S4's I've seen (both before and after, if I'm not
mistaken) have the short, raked antenna near the back of the roofline.
My problem is that radio reception is slightly fuzzy. Does anyone know
if Porsche gave up the windshield location for this reason? I also
notice the reception is clearer when I'm travelling north, which is
toward San Francisco, and presumably the transmission towers.
I've asked the guys at the audio shop if there is a "booster" type
solution but their response was about as fuzzy as my reception. They,
instead, cast aspersions on the factory Blaupunkt "Reno" that I've got
and that I believe was standard issue. Any ideas on which is suspect?
