I use my 928 for every day use.  I don't travel far to work, so the mileage 
isn't an issue.  I also park it in a parking garage, so door dings aren't 
much of an issue either (i have my pick of parking spaces).  The car is a 
blast to drive and i'm enjoying using it every day.  I have always felt 
that cars are meant to be driven and actually maintain themselves a lot 
better when driven on a regular basis (exhaust, tires, etc.).  I got rid of 
my '69 Camaro conv. for just that reason.  The 928 clutch has not given me 
any trouble and i'm not worried about it.  I have considered a beater truck 
or jeep for fair weather days (Texas floods) and to reduce the door ding 
coefficient/vandalism  in certain situations.  The pleasure of driving the 
928 more than outweighs the maint. and mileage, so buckle up and get out 
there....!
