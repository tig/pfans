Gavin Herrin asked...

>Is just one cooling fan suppose to run when turned on by the temperature
sensor?  I thought both where suppose to run but they aren't.  Thanks in
advance.<

Yes, both should run.  They each have their own amplifier so that in case one
fails, you have at least one fan operating.  According to the repair manual,
when one fails, the other fan should operate at 100% speed at all times,
rather than at a varying speed under normal conditions.

You need to check out the circuit to see if the motor is dead or if it is the
amplifier (or broken/loose wires, of course).
