	I'm a new owner....88 S4...
	[snip]
	...my battery is discharging
	to the point that I've replaced it twice...can't afford to have
the
	electrical systems checked right now, so I have to drive it
every day,
	or else...  HELP!

You can check the charging system yourself.  Here are some tips.
.. Check battery condition and that it is fully charged.

.. Check for clean and tight chassis grounding points.  Do the same for
the B+; back of alternator, back of starter solenoid and battery
positive terminal.

.. Measure voltage directly off the battery terminal when car is not
running.  Should be about 12.5v and this will be your reference voltage.
If not, you need to charge it in order to perform the rest of the test.
If don't have a sealed battery, you can use a hydrometer to check each
individual cell.

.. Assuming that the battery is fully charged, start up the car and rev
it up to about 1500 rpm.  Measure the voltage on the battery terminal
again.  Should be at least 13.5v.  If less than 13v, looks like the
alternator is shot.  Measure voltage from the D+ terminal in back of the
alternator to ground.  Should be the same as the battery terminal
measurement.  If not, suspect a faulty ignition switch, alternator
warning light is out, (on a '78) or bypass resistor in parallel to the
warning light is burnt or out of value.  Resister value is about 68 ohm,
5 watt.  You might want to double check this for a '88.  At this point,
you might want to pull the alternator out and have it checked by a
professional for proper voltage and amperage output.  The result of this
test should eliminate alot of the other possibilities.  Save your money.
Go buy a rebuilt from your local auto shop.  They're just as good.  It
cost $150 for my '83 S for a Bosch.  I once rebuilt the same alternator
on my own; $32 for the regulator and $17 for the brushes and bearings.
I got 70K miles out of it.

.. While car is running, measure voltage from the B+ terminal of the
alternator in reference to ground.  Measure voltage of B+ terminal from
the back of the starter's solenoid.  Measure voltage off battery
terminal.  All values should be the same.  If there is a deviation of
0.2 to 0.5 volt, you need to replace the positive cable, depending on
which section of the cable that the voltage drop occurs.

Hope I've been of help..
