It's just a little something Dr. Zarkov worked up while captive on Mongo.

If someone else doesn't get this to you sooner, I'll post the info 
for you when I get home from work.  You may want to call some of your 
local bookstores, as many of them around here carry it on the shelves 
as well.

I'm recovering from the mother of all journeys; I drove my 78 from Montreal
Canada to Austin TX, my new home. The trip was great up until the last 100
miles or so, when I could hear a noise coming from the rear end, it seems to
get louder when cornering and when its under load. I made it back ok, but it
needs looking at. Before I take it anywhere I wanted to know if anyone had any
ideas what it could be, so I can at least sound a little bit knowledgeable to
the mechanic, before he rubs his hands together and I wave my wallet goodbye. 
Any help much appreciated

Hi everyone, I have 2 friends and I am considering (not heavily), to update
there S to the S4 look from AIR, American International Racing. They offer
bolt on fiberglass bumpers. How strong would the fiberglass be? Would it be
better to get oem bumpers and fit them on?

thanks,
matt
