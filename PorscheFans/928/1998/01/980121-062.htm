I used to breakfast with a California Highway Patrol officer
frequently.  One topic that we discussed was window tinting.  Jerry (now
retired from CHP) told me the law is quite specific:

You may tint (or even totally obscure) all windows behind the driver if
you have TWO side mirrors.  The windshield and front door windows may
not have any tint other than factory.  His standard of enforcement was
to ticket any California resident whose non-conforming tint was apparent
to his eyes.  Recent out-of-staters might get off with a warning as
other states have differing laws.
