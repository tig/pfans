Z-box is still out there but has no offerings for the 928...  It may be
possible to adapt their 911 rear seat sub boxes to the 928 but I can
think of much better ways to spend the $1k+  (like for a really good amp
to drive those subs!  McIntosh?  Rane?)

Agreed.  But please *don't* hack up your stock cover they are hard to
replace!  Almost like trying to find a good luggage cover.  Fashioning a
replacement out of plywood or plexiglass is much better...

Because?
a.  couldn't deflate it back into proper shape to reinstall
b.  have no way of inflating to begin with (missing factory airpump)
c.  couldn't jack up car (missing factory jack)
d.  can't get stock lugs off (monkeys at tire store overtorqued)
e.  wrong spare, it hits my brake calipers!
f.  hey, these are $500 Ferragamos!

ok just poking a little fun at you here.  I don't run with a spare
either and have no subs in there yet.  The issue becomes more important
when traveling long distances on less traveled roads though...  Jetflate
can't fix everything so one takes their chances.

....roads without cell sites or emergency roadside phones... ruh roh!

No trays on '90+ cars.

I really like that extend the toolkit area idea or replace with other
panel and drill out/recess.  The Alpine changer is so small it would be
a natural for this.

n/a mfr. but if lucky can still find some 928 parts vendors with 'em

They don't handle hi-power very well though...  Most older speakers have
now deteriorated into flaky former images of themselves and one would be
surprised they make any decent sound.  Screw off those speakers grills
(the whole thing) and take a look it will trip you out!  

I agree again though about just adding a powered sub - it's much easier
than trying to redo the factory speakers / grills and may be as far as
you want to go with stereo mods.

Cool thread.  Do you have a relative named Suzy (Golden) in the SF area?
