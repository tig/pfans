	WHY CHANGE THE OIL?

	It's not so simple:   1) It gets dirty but thats not the only problem.  
If dirt were the only problem somebody would invent a really good filter, 
this would be tricky as you could filter out the additives.

	2) Viscosity, as the engine runs it wears out the oil, one thing that 
happens, the oil gets thicker, a petroleum based oil will start getting 
thicker right away. One reason we only want to use it for 3,000 miles.

	3) The detergent gets used up.  OK what is detergent doing in the oil?  
Dribble some water on the hood ( or any flat surface) of a car, a waxed 
car.  The water will bead up, it will sit in little round puddles.  Now 
take some soapy water dribble it on the same surface, the water will wet 
the surface, there will be a thin film all over.  We want the oil to wet 
all the surfaces, think of the cylinder walls with little beads of oil 
and dry areas.

	So why can you let a synthetic go much longer than 3,000 miles, I only 
change mine once a year?  Thats for another day, but if the viscosity 
statys the same and there is still plenty of detergent, then why change 
the oil?  That can be debated forever, but who came up with 3,000 miles?  
3,000 miles makes sense for petroleum oils but hopefully oils have 
improved in the last 10 years.

	Lesson 3 maybe next week will be what is a good oil, film strength und 
such.
