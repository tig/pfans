I have also been pondering this.  At the moment, mine is some what
safe.  (I will not however discuss on the list by what means.)

In the particular case you site - thieves rummaging through the house
for keys - I would think that a large well-trained dog would suffice.

Also, you can make your keys harder to find.

There are a number of other methods that an owner with some mechanical
and electrical aptitude (and the wiring diagrams from the factory
workshop manuals) can implement to lengthen the amount of time
necessary to make off with a car.

The most important of any of these methods is to limit the number of
persons who know about them to an absolute minimum. If the thief has
to ponder the method or look for its implementation he will have to
spend a lot of time - which he probably doesn't want to do.

P.S. I apologize, in advance, to any female car thieves out there for
presupposing that all car thieves are male and using the male gender
in reference to car thieves in the above.  ;)
