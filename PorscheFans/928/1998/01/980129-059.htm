OK, let me just state that I have an EE degree and a CS degree so
that you understand that I have successfully completed a fair share
of college physics and mathmatics courses.

Weight is a measure of force AND, conversly, force is a measure of
weight. Simple algebra. You're mistaken if you believe that these
relationships are mutually exclusive. Mass equals force * acceleration.
The acceleration, which determins weight, is constant (unless you're
planning on leaving this planet).

As long as aerodynamics are measured in one or the other (force or
weight...it does not matter as stated above), then the weight of
the car is a factor not to be ignored (by anyone who wishes to
understand the truth).

It doesn't matter if we use the metric system or the English system.
We're not doing any car flipping tests on anything besides the
constant 32 feet per second squared pull of the earths gravity. Aww...
go ahead an say that should really be expressed as meters/sec/sec ;-)

Aerodynamics run lock-step with weight (or Mass).
