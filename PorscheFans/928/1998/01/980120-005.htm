I am very disappointed with the Blaupunkt tuner that is in my car.  I
used to sell Blaupunkt back in 1990 and they were one of the better
units that we sold.  Over the years I have found that Kenwood has the
best FM tuner and have been looking at buying their KDCPS907
(http://www.kenwoodusa.com/catalog/car/CD_Player-Receivers/KDC-PS907.htm
l).  Before I buy the Kenwood, has anyone had any experience with the
Blaupunkt 7 Series Toronto?  The Blaupunkt would look better in my 928!

The best I can do is direct you to the mail list on www.porschefans.com for
928's.  There you will find discussion directed to the 928.  There are also
other lists for the other models.  There is currently a discussion about
forming a 928's only owners group.  Right now I have copied this message to
the list members at the Porsche Fans 928 list, and I have copied it to
specific people in the the Virginia area.  We have had some back and forth
about organizing a drive this winter.  It may get more serious as the next few
weeks pass.  There is a porsche performance products expo going on during the
last saturday in January in Tysons.  We will be having the second annual 928
only meet in the D.C. area next September.  As luck would have it you are
living near there.  The organizer is Ed Ruiz, and he also is copied into this
message.  You can look at the addresses on the CC's and see that there are
several devoted 928 fans in and around Virginia.  

I have added your name to the list.  I use it to broadcast to all the local
928's when and if something relevant comes up.  They will also now have your
email address and location information.

Let me know if you ever make it down around Williamsburg.  I will be up to
D.C. saturday, unfortunately not in my car (well maybe, but it looks like
not), and then again next week without my car.  So next time I am heading up
that way with the car and have some spare time I will send an email out.
