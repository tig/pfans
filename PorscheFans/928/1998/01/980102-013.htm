Roger,
You had written the list and asked about opinions on the SC400 Lexus
-vs- the 928.  In the course of doing what I do (locating and brokering)
I have had the chance to own and drive a wide variety of automobiles,
the SC400 included.  As most people will tell you, it is very difficult
to compare apples to oranges and get a fair comparison.  This is what
you would be doing with a Lexus -vs- Porsche comparison.  The Lexus is a
very nice car.  Is it worth the $55K that they cost new?  No way.  Is it
worth the money that I can buy them for?  Absolutely.  Here's the
lowdown: The SC400, as you know, has a DOHC 32 valve V-8, which in my
opinion is too slow for such an engine.  Keep in mind though that the
Lexus buyer doesn't care bout 0-60 times, they just want to be abe to
say that the car is *fast* while riding to the golf course.  They are
extremely smooth, quiet, and appareantly very reliable.  The interiors
are laid out very well and all the switches are easily within reach. 
One thing that always bothers me about Japanese cars though is the
seats.  Even in an NSX the seats are not as comfortable as they should
be, and the leather is very prone to cracking.  Not something I want in
an expensive car.  The Japanese paint is a little too *thin* for me ...
not anywhere near the quality of Porsche.  Otherwise the SC400 would be
a good buy if you could get one cheap enough.  But they DO NOT compare
to a 928 in any way.  They aspire to.
