<dd>&gt;He entered a street that was flooded about a foot deep. He
attempted to blast
<dd>&gt;his way through this and the engine in his new BMW 740 IL died
immediately.

<dd>&gt;the repair bill was $17,000.00 because there was a hole in the
engine caused
<dd>&gt;by hitting the puddle. I figure I could hit the Atlantic Ocean at
something
<dd>&gt;approaching the speed of sound without making a seventeen
thousand dollar
<dd>&gt;hole in my engine. What the hell does a seventeen thousand dollar
hole even
<dd>&gt;look like?<br>
<br>

<dd>I was in Ft. Lauderdale late last summer looking for a 928. After
having breakfast, I noticed a black 928S4 on a lift in the shop next to
the restaurant. I figured that I'd walk over and talk to someone there on
the chance that it might be for sale.<br>
<br>

<dd>The mechanic said that it wasn't but it would be as soon as the new
car that the owner had ordered showed up. I noticed that the engine was
definitly getting more than a little work done on it, so I asked what had
happened to the car. The guy replied that the owner drove it through a
puddle, and that they weren't very good submarines.<br>
<br>

<dd>The engine had gotten enough water through the air intake tubes to
hydro lock it. There wasn't any hole in the block, but plenty of other
bent and broken stuff. The mechanic said that the bill was going to be
somewhere over $12,000 when it was back in one piece. If a new block
would have been needed, and the work was being done at Porsche instead of
at an independent shop, I could see $17,000 being very realistic.<br>
