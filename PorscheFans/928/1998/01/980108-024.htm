Dear Ed, Brian and the rest of the "LAnd Shark" tamers:

Last year was the first "P3-Expo" and it was lots of information and
equipment about and for Porsches. There were five speakers on different
topics. The topics were: Tires, Suspension/performance alignments, Routine
maintenance, performance tuning, and track driving techniques.

This year, I do not know what the topics will be. I do know that one or two
of last years speakers will be back. The products displayed by vendors
ranges from the routine to the radical. Larry Reynolds will be there with
his supply of recommended cleaning products. Racing equipment will be
available from several vendors. Tires and anything else that helps a Porsche
perform at or better than it's original potential will also be on display
and/or available.

The cost to the public is $0.00. Hope to see you there and happy motoring.
Ed
