Del, I presume you meant to say that the ignition ON temps are LOWER than the
ignition OFF temps, which would indeed explain why the fans normally turn off
after the ignition is tuned off.  In any case, I don't have the manuals in
front of me, but if memory serves me right, the intake plenum temp for fans ON
is around 82C, and the coolant temp for fans ON is around 78C (more or less).
So, if the ignition OFF temp info you were given by PCNA is correct, then it
makes the observed operation of the fans and the described operation in the
owner's manual jive....that's good.

However, doesn't it make you a little P.O.'d that the ignition OFF temp values
are not provided in the service manuals?  How are you ever supposed to figure
out what's going on if this kind of key information is secreted away by the
factory.  This is something that should definitely be added to the FAQ list to
clear up fan operation once and for all.

....but we better be sure about this info...maybe someone can try activating
the fans by heating up the plenum sensor with a heat source (light bulb?) with
the ignition OFF to see if it does indeed activate the fans.

<<Does anyone have the factory spec booklet for MY 1989 to confirm/verify

these numbers?

Owners of '89 - '91s can you post your numbers to help clarify? >>

In my spec book it shows that the engine is an "81" for the S4, and an "85"
for the GT.  I can't go look at the car right now, but if it is still
important this weekend I can look.

Phil-
Were you able to read either the "UU" encoded photos, or the "BIN" photo that
I sent later?  Do you want me to resend all of them in "BIN"?

Let me know.
