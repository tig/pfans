Eventually the weak battery will be charged by the alternator to a point
where it will sustain the operation of the vehicle.  The big assumption
is that the condition of the battery is good to begin with and that you
run the vehicle at least 2,000 rpm (which is actually 4,000 rpm at the
alternator's pulley...) without any accessory load for an extended
period of time.  A battery in good condition should be able to retain a
charge relatively fast.  I always put the battery on a charger at the
first opportunity whenever I left a drain on by accident.  If you have a
questionable battery and if you just booster-jump enough to start the
car and drive off, you will not get very far.  

An alternator does not have permanent magnets like a generator.  The
magnetic field is created via a coil winding being energized by the
battery.  If you have a weak battery, the magnetic field created will be
weak; hence a low charging rate.  (I'm assuming that you're able to
start the car to begin with, which I doubt...).  I've never seen a car
run without a battery before.  Unless it is equipped with a generator
instead of an alternator.  Generators became obsolete back in the mid
60s.

	Vince,

	I am confused.  Why can a battery get recharged after being
drained and
	the car having a boost.  Is the boost enough to get a charge in
the
	battery to get the charging started?  Also, why can a car run
without
	a battery...

	like I said, I am confused...
