Hi, I have been off the list for a few months and it is nice to be back
amongst  you guys & gals. My problem is I have just replaced my fuel pump
and filter in my 1986 928S. I am getting erratic performance. I finally
noticed when I fill the tank, it runs like a clock until I am at a half tank
of gas. My question is is there a fuel pressure regulator that I need to
change along with the fuel pump? Where is it located, do I have to take it
to my mechanic or is it somthing that I can do?

Guy I have never had my 86 run so great (on a fulltank), A new fuel pump has
worked wonder for my 928, did not know this until the pump went dead on
Ventura Blvd (Los Angeles). I love this car, I travel 150 mile a day to work
and the days I take the 928 are most enjoyabe. The acceleration keeps
begging for more even at 90-100 mph (hope none of you guys are CHP - CA
Highway Patrol).

Also, I just purchased some synthetic oil by Mobil, first time I have ever
seen this in store  0W-30 (low viscosity oil). It work in temperature well
below freezing (50 below) and up to 400 - degrees. I put the stuff in my 928
and she seem to love it. Anybody else used this product. It cost the same as
all  mobile oils.

Sorry I am so long winded, just glad to be back among people with real cars.
(hehehe)
