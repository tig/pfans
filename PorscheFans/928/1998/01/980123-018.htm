Eduardo,

Lets face it.  There aren't really a lot of 928s anywhere!  However, =
There are probably more of them in South Florida than anywhere else with =
the possible exception of California.  They aren't all that difficult to =
find, but you have to be really careful who you buy from.  Although =
there are a lot of reputable dealers in the Miami area there are, =
unfortunately, also some of the worst thieves I've ever met there.   =
Just know that the guy who comes across like Mother Theresa, could very =
well be Atilla the Hun.=20

 Something to bear in mind that is at least indirectly connected to the =
above.  The ports of Miami and Ft. Lauderdale ship hundreds of stolen =
cars every week to South and Central America, as well as Europe.  A =
business that huge obviously attracts many of the worst scumbags and =
sleazoids in the western hemisphere.
