 Hi guys
=20
 I think I should throw some darknes over the sport shock issue (in
Swenglish)

 In my original -90 sales broschure it says over changes betwen S4 and GT=
:
 "Changes to the suspension include stiffened gas-filled Sport shock
 absorbers and uprated springs."  The pictures of the shocks (S4 or GT I
 don=B4t know) in the broschure shows a baby blue colour in front and bla=
ck
in
 rear (different pictures, maybe not on same car).
=20
 The suspension on a original (and new) GT is discribed in "Porsche 928
 performance portfolio 77- 94" on p116 as "... riding down a log pile in =
an
 iron canoe...."
=20
 I have the 474 option code on my car. I don=B4t know if it is the origin=
al
 shocks on the car but the drivers side front shock was red with a black
 top. Can this be a shock that is harder then riding down a log pile in a=
n
 iron canoe? Well I don=B4t know, the car is eight years old and is defin=
itly
 in need of some new shocks (+ a lot of others).
=20
 In the option decoder on the web 474 meant sport shock absorbers Bilstei=
n=20

 Yep guys, that radio antenna on the top of your cars realy create the
magic
 blower syndrome (I don=B4t have either antenna or MBS (knock on wood)).
