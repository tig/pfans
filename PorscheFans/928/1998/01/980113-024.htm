All:

I've read with some amusement and then some concern the recent posts on
alternator functions and the battery.  I'd like to add my thoughts and
experiences to the discussion.

1)  The alternator requires an initial signal voltage to energize the field
windings.  With the alternator spinning,  the current required from the
battery to maintain the field should be zero.  This initial field current is
typically supplied through a light bulb in the dash pod, energized whenever
the ignition is in the 'on' position.  In the event the alternator ceases to
function,  the regulator will try to add more current to the field windings.
Since no current is available from the stator windings,  current is drawn
through the bulb from the ignition switch and battery.

2)  The alternator generates alternating current from three separate
windings in the stator.  The rotating field coils live in the rotor, and are
fed through brushes and slip rings on the rotor.  The alternating current is
changed to DC by routing the coil output through a bank of diodes in the
alternator.  Each of the three coils has a diode on either end to direct the
current to the correct place.

3)  These diodes are rated somewhere in excess of the maximum current
capacity of the coils, and somewhere slightly in excess of the maximum
charging voltage.  Since the voltage regulator limits the output based on
voltage only,  this rating is typically in the 16 volt range.

4) The voltage regulator looks at the voltage at the common output terminal,
and compares it to the reference diode built in to the regulator.  If the
average voltage at the output terninal goes low,  more current is sent to
the field coils.  Higher voltage causes the field current to be reduced.

5)  The three coils generate an AC voltage that gets rectified into DC,  but
it's not pure DC like from a battery.  The three coils in fact produce a
series of overlapping current 'waves', with the peak voltage of waves
restrained by the impedance of the battery.  For this discussion,  impedance
is nothing more than the ability of the battery to accept current.  Maybe
'internal resistance' or 'capacitance' would be a better term.  Anyway, the
regulator looks at the average output and adjusts the field current to
maintain that.

6)  When you disconnect the battery with the engine running,  the peak
voltages from the coils are no longer restrained by the battery's impedance
or internal resistance.  This allows the alternator coils to work in a
manner similar to an ignition coil, where the unrestrained output voltage
climbs until it is restrained by something.  On the way to this restraint,
the terminal voltage exceeds the voltage rating of the diodes, causing them
to fail.  This is a --very-- quick process, by the way.  It only takes a few
rotations to kill a diode pack.  The process is a progressive thing,  where
the weakest diode will fail,  possibly limiting the output some.  Another
will fail if the voltage is still too high, and so on until either all the
coils have failed diodes or the voltage is low enough due to other loads.
The net effect is that the alternator now has diminished or no charging
capacity.  This explains why the car may still run;  Only one coil and diode
set needs to be intact to provide minimum system voltage.  There are other
factors associated with saturation of the coils that are present but not so
important to this discussion.

7)  On the way to destroying the diodes with this unrestrained voltage, all
connected electrical items are exposed to the same voltage spikes until the
diodes fail.  Solid-state equipment like your radio,  your engine management
computers and your radar detector are potential victims (sorry...).

Conclusions:

NEVER disconnect the battery from the car while the engine is running.
Second rule is "Never break rule number one."  Besides risking instant
damage to the alternator,  those expensive electronic modules may be turned
to junk in a matter of seconds.

There is the issue of the rear-mounted battery in our cars.  The longer
distance for the current to flow provides a bigger opportunity for cable
resistance to increase the effective impedance of the battery.  The long
path also includes the body of the car for the return from the battery, so
ground connections at the battery and the engine become critical also.
Maintaining low-resistance connections means they must be scrupulously clean
and free of corrosion.  To this end,  consider using dielectric grease as a
protective coating in primary connections.  These includes all battery
cables and ground connections at the frame.

Battery maintenance is a secondary issue, where low electrolyte levels
increase the battery's impedance.  



Somebody mentioned load on the alternator and battery capacity.  In the
ideal world,  the battery is drained for a very short period to operate the
starter motor and other engine loads until the engine is running.  From that
point on the alternator will provide enough current to maintain system
voltage at the proscribed level.  This means the electrical loads of the car
plus whatever current is required to maintain the battery at that same voltage.

In the real world the alternator may have diminished output at low RPM's due
to a load that exceeds the alternator's capability curve at that RPM.  For
example,  the car was hard to start due to hot conditions.  The A/C,
headlights and wipers are on, and the stereo is turned up loud, etc.  This
is a condition where the alternator will not have enough capacity at idle,
at least until the battery has had a chance to recharge some.  By the time
the engine reaches maybe 1500 RPM,  there is almost full capacity available.
So the battery is only used to start the car and supply current during those
times when the battery is discharged and/or the engine is turning too slowly
to supply the other normal electrical loads.

Adding loads to the electrical system means that there is less current
available to recharge the battery at low RPM's.  Installing the 100w
headlights with the 100w auxiliary high beams and the 100w fog lights is a
good example-- 400w of lighting just in the front of the car, plus all the
other "normal" loads, will exceed the alternator's capacity at idle.  Add in
500w of Class-A or AB stereo power amp in your car, and you have a bit more
load than is probably wise.  Divide the total load in watts by 12 to get the
load amps,  then compare that to the alternator's capacity.  In addition to
these 'static' loads add is the charging load to the battery to recover from
starting the car.

Derate everything if the temperature is higher,  and add in extra charging
current if the outside temp is close to freezing.  There's a chance you will
run the battery down idling in traffic-- trust me on this!


I'm open to further discussion and even criticism on the above info.
