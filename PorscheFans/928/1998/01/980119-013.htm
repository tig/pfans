I agree with Leonard, DO IT!!!

I drive my 1986S, auto everyday.  I don't even own another car presently,
shoot if I could tow my boat with my 928, I wouldn't even need a truck.  I
am currently living in St.Louis and have to deal with winter weather etc.
etc.  NO PROBLEM!!!  Besides you emanate an air of confidence, or in some
minds - stupidity, when you have the moxy to drive a 928 in winter weather.

I just moved back here from Arlington Va. and will most likely be heading
back in the near future, I miss DC!!! :(  But, I drove my 928 everyday from
Arlington to Germantown Md.... and Loved every minute of it!!!  There isn't
a better ride out there.

As far as maintenance, I wouldn't worry about.  You'll just become in better
tune with your car and you might realize a couple of items that you wouldn't
normally notice when rec-driving.

There are a couple of suggestions that I have when it comes to mechanics:

-  Car Beautiful/Intersport - Vienna Va.  I went to highschool with these
guys at James Madison High Vienna.  Located behind the "Vienna Inn" on Mill
St.  They are Porsche Junkies and I was never lead astray by there advice or
there prices.  The only problem with them is that they have more work than
they can do and you might have to wait a while to get an appointment.  They
are a great part store as well and can get you almost any part for your 928
quick and cheaper than 928 Intl most of the time!!!

-  In Rockville I had a guy do some work for me too.  He replaced all of my
engine gaskets/seals.  Can't remember his name or store, but I think that is
was something like autotech, autohause or automotion.  But, he impressed my
with his 928 knowledge and the cleanliness of his shop.  He actually owns
one and loves to drive it!!!  He is well known in the PCA there as the guy
who used liquid nitrogen on the intakes of his 930-turbo to get that
air/fuel dense.  If you would like his info, let me know and I will take a
look at my records.

Enjoy and have fun on I-495.  Nice little road when you can move on it!!!
