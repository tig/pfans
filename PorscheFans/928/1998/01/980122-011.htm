	 With a small file I was able to polish up the wafer correctly
and
	insert the key ;-), and then make the car driveable. Now comes
the
	problem, I don't wish to remove the key, because the Porche
Dealer in
	Brisbane (about 120km away) says that the key-switch is a throw
away item
	- not fixable(therefore the replacement cost is also going to be
	ridiculously high), so If I remove the key I may never get it
back in...
	My locksmith has tells me that the barrel should be able to be
worked on
	easily, however he admits that he hasn't ever worked on a
porsche
	key-switch before (There isn't a big demand around this area) so
no
	guarrantees.

	The Porsche dealer probably misunderstood what you were telling
him/her.  There is an electrical switch assembly behind the tumbler.
What you've described sounds like the tumbler, key, or both is worn.
There's probably nothing wrong with the electrical switch assembly but
worth inspecting since the charging system relies on a particular
contact within the assembly to operate optimally.  If I remember
correctly, you can purchase a new key and tumbler from Automotion for
about $120.  I have some reservation about the locksmith fixing the
tumbler.  Your 928's lock is not like your typical Ford.  The keys are
"laser cut"; with all sort of funny angles and I'm sure the matching
tumbler is just as special.  Porsche want to make it difficult for the
criminal element.  Hope I've been of help.
