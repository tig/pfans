  Geez... We always knew that 911 guys looked down on our cars, but now
  to have them called the SUV of the Porsche family?!  This may be more
  than we can tolerate...
  
  Check the 928 archives over the past 3 weeks or so.  There was quite a
  bit of discussion about the suitability of using a 928 for winter
  driving.

  Brakes were upgraded in '82 and these may preclude the use of
  15" wheels on any car from that year forward.  Double check the
  archives, but I recall that most owners that drove in snow just
  used factory 16" wheels.

  Offset - no.  Bolt pattern - probably, but I'm not positive.  
  Anyway, they won't fit (properly).

  All cars came with rear ride height adjusters, and many came with front
  adjusters, so there's always the possibility that you've seen cars which
  were adjusted out of spec.  Aside from the S4->, I don't know of the 
  factory changing the ride height measurements.  The early cars without 
  the S spoiler in front give the illusion of sitting higher.
  
  Go buy a 928 and you'll want to start using that air cooled car as
  a snowblower!
