Dear Ed and the rest of the "Land Shark" tamers:

I want to thank Kim Crumb for the article on the Frenzy. In case you don't
know, he is wearing the sun-glasses and a light jacket facing the camera in
the first photo. In the group photo, I am the only one in the first row
(kneeling) wearing  a hat.

My car is the dark one in the first photo. The plate (at that time) was
"POWRSHA". You'll have to come to "Frenzy Zwei" to see what it is this year.
(Potomac Region folks, please don't give it away.)

Looking forward to seeing many of you at P3-Expo, and then at the next
Frenzy on 9/27/98.

Happy motoring. Ed
