Hiya James!

Good to see you on the (928) list!

These are both excellent choices.  Porsche designed the 928 from the
ground up to do exactly what you described x 2  (65mph limit?  Hah try
autobahn speeds for hours every day).  My old '84 had 145k miles (and
counting with it's new owner) and I feel was pretty representative of
the average daily driver type of previous owner (M.D.).  That particular
car had zero days off the road due to mechanical problem, dyno'd
stronger than stock, and did the 1/4 mile faster than stock.  Beautiful
full leather interior - headliner, sunroof panel, steering wheel,
dashboard, wow!  All seats, mirrors, switches, roof, etc. worked.  The
A/C system blows more ice cold air than our minivan, or, my '90 928 GT
for that matter.  It was an excellent find.

You are selecting a very powerful car with the 928 so drive accordingly
during inclement weather.  If deep snow is on the road, keep your ground
clearance in mind.  Stories of road plowing with a 928 are humourous but
not if you're the one getting stuck.  During the snow months you could
always adjust the road height up (within factory specs natch) to gain a
bit more road clearance.  FWIW the '90 and up have many features for
your safety - ABS and PSD (electronic posi), heated elec mirrors and
windshield washers, etc.  

I'd like to direct you to a book entitled Project 928 by Motor Buch
Verlag.  This book details the development of the 928 like no other.  In
it you will learn of Porsche's obessive testing of the 928 - from the
deserts to the icefields.  Rigorous engine dyno testing simulating 300k
miles.  You will find no Grand Tourer  more capable than the 928.

This is a good sign.  We tend to be as fanatical about our cars as
Porsche.

Each car is unique and many of the older cars have logged a bunch of
miles by now in addition to being over two decades old.  That's some
service life for a car that could probably still do over 145 mph. 
Again, you are looking at much newer cars, especially in the GTS.  I am
hoping James Morrison will respond to you as he just bought a GTS.

Though a lost t-belt could put you in a world of hurt, only a handful
have ever been reported here and even less that have caused serious
engine damage.  I think there was only one post about a failed water
pump causing severe damage but don't recall the circumstances.  I just
want to put the 928 in a fair light for you.  

Another direct example is my GT - supposedly the 'high strung' example. 
I put my car away 'wet' and ready to go at a moment's notice which it
does without fail. I did have to replace the fuel pump, a plastic
shifter part and a rubber clutch hose but these kinds of things could
apply to any other 7 year old, 80k mile car.  I will agree that in
Porsche's quest to keep up with the Lexus's's :)  that some of the
electronic gee gaws can be troubling but this could turn out to be a
hidden plus (ie. buyer's leverage during purchase and fix once home in
your garage).  Do try to find a troublefree car first though!

Ok, it's your call whether you have a 928 in your future.  Go and test
drive as many different cars as you can.  Spend some time in your search
and get to know the marque and model, and us too hopefully!  Do keep in
mind the cars you're looking at originally sold for in excess of $75k
but not without reason - the 928 was for many years Porsche's luxury
flagship *and* fastest street offering.  This is no joke and I believe
Al Holbert's record setting run of 171.172mph in a stock 928 S4 still
stands today.  You will be buying into a world class supercar at bargain
prices - make it count and find the newest, best example you can.

Good luck in your shark hunt,
Phil Tong
