Hey all, 
Just catching up on some digests and since ther are so many posts about
wax and Rain-X I thought I'd throw in my thoughts.  First off, Zymol is
the best wax that I have ever used, period.  It is absolutely worth the
money.  The polish that you can buy at AutoZone, etc. is good, but it is
NOT wax.  It does not seal your paint.  I find that it is good for
removing small scratches, etc., but you really need to wax your car with
the Zymol carbon or creme wax afterwards.  As for the price, as many of
you know just about every car that I own or have owned in the past five
years has been black, and my "jar" of Zymol always lasts me at least a
year of waxing all of my cars every two weeks.  $40 a year isn't bad
when you are taking care of over $100K worth of auto is it?  But, if
some of you can't stomach that much for wax I also highly recommend "Wax
Shop" products.  Secondly, Rain-X is a total waste of money.  It is
difficult to apply and does tend to "smear" and streak your windshield. 
Using the same old wax that you apply to your paint  works just as well
and doesn't cost $5 dollars per bottle. Of course I am no expert, and I
am not affiliated with any wax companies, etc.
