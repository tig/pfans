Friday morning, I took the shark to Portland.  It was minus four degrees F.
when I took out the car.  Saturday morning, when I got up, it was +39 F, and
raining like mad.  I Had to buy a huge sump pump to assist the regular sump
pump, because of all the rain on top of all the snow and ice that we have,
was causing a monster flood in the basement of my inn...the kind that
destroys boilers, refrigerationequipment, water heaters, etc....Anyway....

All this talk about shortening shift levers on 928s reminds me of a story I
once heard about a priest and a rabbi who where very close friends.  They
lived next door to each other, and had a sort of competition going, as close
friends sometimes will.

When one bought a new stereo, the other bought a slightly fancier one.  When
one bought a television, the other bought a one with a bigger screen.

Anyway, one day the rabbi bought a new Cadillac.  NOt to be outdone, the
priest went out and bought a new cadillac.  

However, so the story goes, the rabbi finally one, when the priest looked
out the window one morning, and saw the rabbi under his new cadillac, sawing
four inches off the tail pipe.
