Steve,

As I think I said in my orignal post, I know NOW not to do it that way.  Yes,
it could damage the alternator (unlikely though), but more importantly, the
voltage could go AWOL and damage many more expensive electronic items
scattered around the car.  The two vehicles I did it on were an early Triumph
(as in "What is electronics?") and a Lotus Esprit, with carburettors and the
only thing at risk being the tachometer.

But I won't do it again, except perhaps on my Seven which not only has no
electronics but hardly anything electrical, either.  (as on "Heater? Radio? What
are these unnecessary items?")
