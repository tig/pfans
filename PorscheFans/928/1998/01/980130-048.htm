Old Volvos newer dies they become mules. I=B4ve owned six german cars, on=
e
Italian and two Volvo 245. I hold the Italian (Alfa Romeo 164 TS) for the
nicest and the Volvos for the most reliable cars. German cars often need
mechanical work around 60-100k miles (mostly head and valve job).

If you should buy a Volvo stay away from the V6, it's 2/3 French and not =
as
reliable as the four cylinder engines. The four cylinder engines is real =
strong
(not hp strong), easy to start and cheap to fix (15$ for wires and 2$ for=
 a
carburator membrane), but it takes a lot of fuel.

The estate version is a good second car for the work you don't want to do=
 with
the 928.
