I'm new to the list and as I intend to buy my first 928 this week I can give
up to date info about prices in a different country. I forgot to mention,
I'm living in Hungary, Europe. 
In my country importing cars older than 4 years is simply forbidden (very
strong car importers loby).  So one can expect quite high used car prices. 
To my luck 928s holds their value quite badly. I think they are at the
absolute bottom now
Usual price range is around USD 5000 for an early, worn 928 and USD 170000
for a clean '90 GT. Theay are usuallyhigh mileage cars from Germany,
imported a couple of years ago.

In connection with it I'd like to ask a question.
I'm going to buy an 83 928s euro spec manual 928S this week. It is very
sraight and clean, loaded with extras, one can eat out of the engine bay.
The car looks extremely well cared for. Except a very small parking lot
stuff it seems to be very good. 
The only problem that the car has  140k miles on the odometer. Is it a
problem at all? How much is it for the magnificent v8? 
Could you help me what to check, what to look for before I buy it. Shoul I
stay away and look for lower mileage?

thanks for the help.

Ferenc in Hungary
