David,

Thanks for your info.
The shop owner actually suggested me to come down and see how
much the wear is on the intermediate plate so I went. (so that I can
make up my mind whether to replace it or not)

The wear was fairly noticeable but not that much. The shop owner
( I assume) said it's in a difficult stage to decide whether to replace
or to reuse it. If I want the cluch to be perfect then I shold replace it
since a new clucth and plate will have both smooth surfaces as you
mentioned.

I decided not to replace it since the cost of the part is so expensive
( at least to me), besides, the problem doesn't seem to be significant and
probably go away after a while.

Now, I just regret a bit that if I notice the wear of the clutch a bit earlier
so that I don't have to damage the plate with the metal pieces that nail the
clucth (the graphite look one)....

I just wonder that the feedback of clutch wear comes all of the sudden
without any signs of warning? I think it should come with a small sign
of wear first but I felt like it came all of the sudden in my experience.
Is there  good ways to find out the clutch wear?
