According to the unofficial 928 homepage, last month's 'Excellence'
which featured the 928, and my awesome wisdom *COUGH COUGH*...

....the 928s4 model, that is those that were called s4 by the factory,
didn't come 'til 1997.  However, the '1996 1/2' 928's were shipped with
the new s4 motor and abs brakes, but with the 'old' body style.  So, to
conclude, one can have a psuedo s4 from '86--and a half that is!

(hate those 1/2 year cars! makes life so confusing!)

Corrections appreciated.

Dave R. sent a message to: <kgoheer@atlanta.com>, asking:

Prestone and Zerex fall into these ... why do you suggest staying away from
these formulas?
<snip>
Hopefully, staying away from phosphate AND silicate containing antifreezes
will make your new pump last longer.>

........I believe this was from my original message to kgoheer warning that not
only are phosphates bad, but silicates are VERY bad for pump life.  These two
additives are both used to protect aluminum engines from corrosion effects,
but they are detrimental to pump life since the silicate (basically sharp
sand) cuts up the seals.  In an earlier post to this list a couple of months
ago, I quoted some articles from the automotive industry which categorically
warn about the shortened pump life due to silicate containing anti-freeze
formulations.  Recent formulations (which tend to be more costly) do not use
phosphates and/or silicates - hence the post to make sure that you avoid BOTH
of these additives when you change your anti-freeze the next time.

Hope this clears up the situation.  If you'd like, I probably can re-post my
earlier anti-freeze info.
