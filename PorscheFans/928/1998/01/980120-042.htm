	Exterior window trim:
	-  How is it attached to the door?

It is pressure-fitted to the frame.  I gently pryed mine off with a 6"
crowbar.  The corner pieces close to the mirrors are a bitch to remove.
You practically have to destroy it in order to remove it.  It is very
flimsy.  These pieces are held on from the back with spring nuts.  Be
prepared to spend about $35 each for new ones.

	-  Do you have to take the internal door panel off to replace
it?

To avoid damage to the interior pieces, yes, I highly recommend removing
it first.

	-  Did you have any luck finding it from someone else than
Porsche?

Majority of the trim pieces that I've seen was removed carelessly.  Most
of them are in damaged condition.  You might have better luck than I do
in finding them.

	Internal:
	-  Really don't know what to ask, but I want to get my windows
back to
	smooth operation.  what did you have to do?  I know that there
is a roller
	that commonly breaks and that there is felt along the tracks
that comes off
	and allows the window to get scratches in it.  Anything else?

Things to check for:  Make sure the window motor asssembly are tightly
mounted to the frame.  You'll probably find some loose bolts.  Lube the
gear assembly lightly.  Too much lube will attract dirt.  Check the
condition of the nylon roller that's on the end of the crank arm.  New
one can be purchased but you need to acquire the service of a machine
shop.  Check the window guide and the tube that it travel on for wear.
Lube if necessary.  I use high temp wheel bearing grease.  There is a
tech bulletin about updated guides from Porsche.  You might want to
inquire on this.  Supposedly the new guides prevent excess play of the
glass pane and stop it from rattling.  The felt-block guides on the top
of the window is probably out of adjustment.  Adjust so that it will
only apply sufficient pressure against the glass to prevent rattle.
You'll be rolling the window up and down alot while adjusting.  Have a
battery charger handy.
