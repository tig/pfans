Howdy All!!!
=20
It's been a while since I have had the opportunity to be active on the =
list, but I thought that I would start back up again by informing all of =
you about a beautiful car that I looked at this weekend.
=20
It is a black on black 1990 S4 with polished rims.  Is your mouth =
watering yet?  The car looks like it just came out of the box.  It has =
been in a climate controlled garage since it's purchase and has only =
been driven in the rain twice, by the current owner.  You can tell =
too...  I mean there isn't a scratch or blemish anywhere on this car.  =
Made me feel guilty for using my 1986 S for a daily driver, but I get =
more enjoyment out of mine.  The current owner(second) of the car bought =
it used from Plaza here in St.Louis in 1992.  It was an original Plaza =
car and all service has been performed at plaza with dealer and =
personnel records to verify.  It currently has approx.. 47,000 miles.  I =
own a 1986 and this was the first 1990 that I had ever looked at, but it =
has a digital/analog dash that had all the bells and whistles, pretty =
awesome!!!  I was also surprised at how smoothly the car drove.  I guess =
the S4 suspension really brought the ride level up a few notches.  Rear =
A/C, seat memory etc. etc.  Not sure what options were available that =
year, but I think that it had all of them.  It's factory date was =
January 15, 1990. =20
=20
Of course, as with all 928s the stereo was an afterthought.  The current =
Blaupunk(sp?) tape deck would need to be upgraded to something a little =
more equal with the performance level of the car, but other than that it =
was a beauty.  If anyone is interested in talking with the owner, send =
me a personnel e-mail and I will give you his info.  He is aware of the =
market value of 928s and I think would sell the car for a good deal. =20

Good to be back!!!
