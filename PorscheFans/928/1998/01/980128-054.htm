Dear pilots,

I was wondering what kinds of cars you use as mules when the shark is in 
the shop or merely unavailable. I drive the 928 to work every day (I've 
got an '85S). I've had it since '89, and it is an absolutely awesome 
daily driver when well cared for. When the Porsche is broken, however, I 
drive an '83 Chevette (!!!) that belongs to my mom (with a "My son is in 
the US Army" sticker). The 'Vette, as I affectionately call it, has 
never let me down. My mother is its original owner, and it has been 
well-maintained; however, there comes a time when one must get "A Mule 
of One's Own," and i was wondering about the personal preferences of 
those in the group.

Also...My fuel meter is stuck in the top (full). This is an electrical 
problem (the 928's plague) that comes on when the ignition switch is 
turned. If anyone has experienced this and knows a fix, please post or 
email me. Any help is greatly appreciated.

thanx,
jojo712@gate.net
