Sounds like an ok deal to me - not great, but ok.  It's very difficult to
determine what is a good buy and what is not with these cars since the
price is influenced by so many factors.  It's very expensive and difficult
to restore a car that has been mistreated so the discounts on beat-up cars
are for a good reason and the premiums that nicer cars bring are usually
worth it.

Check it over closely - take your time with it.  Try little things like
windshield washers, climate control, cruise control, power seats/mirrors,
rear hatch release and check for pirated parts such as spare tire, air
pump, tool kit, luggage cover, etc.  Look for signs of fluid leaks and
squeeze a bunch of the rubber hoses under the hood - if they're mushy,
they're shot and some that snake under the intake pipes are very difficult
(expensive) to replace.

I haven't had any trouble finding parts.  There are many parts dealers
around the country (Vertex right there in Miami is one of the best, IMO)
who can usually get you whatever you need quickly.

Find out about it's service history, particularly the timing belt.  If it
hasn't been replaced in 40,000 miles or so or there's no record, expect to
drop ~$1000 on a belt/water pump replacement.  Oil pressure should be
pegged at idle when cold and drop off at low engine revs as the oil heats.
There are many other things to check to feel comfortable with your purchase
which really require a mechanic familiar with 928's.  If the dealer is
reluctant to let you take it for a checkup, forget it.

Which brings me back to your request for help in finding a mechanic in the
Miami area.  I'll post this to the list and maybe someone will help you
out.  Also, Vertex might know some good 928 mechanics in Miami.  Good luck.
