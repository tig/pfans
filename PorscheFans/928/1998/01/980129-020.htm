I think you're just not understanding the definition of aerodynamics.
Aero
causes forces, and those forces can lift weight, but that's the only
connection.

>>Explain why a funny car lifts off (weight distribution-acceleration)

Unrelated to aero--you don't have enough speed for the aero to cause
lift.  A 
funny car pops its front due to weight transfer.  The center of mass
(about
a foot or two above the ground) is being moved by the frictional force
exerted
by the tires at the ground (parallel to the ground).  This causes torque
about
the center of mass, which makes the vehicle rotate, transferring weight
to 
the rear and popping the front end up.  

Two primary considerations for preventing this:

 - move weight forward, so the torque isn't sufficient to lift it
 - lower the car's center of mass, since torque = force X distance, and 
   the distance is from the driving tire contact patch to the center of
mass

Secondary techniques:

 - wheelie bar, which physically restrains the car's rotation (but will
lift the
   driving tires)
 - suspension stiffness, which prevents the car from squatting as much
   and hence you don't build up angular momentum from the torque

>>Beside, speaking of names,  this reponse was directed to Mike. Is your

I believe you responded to the list, which makes you fair game!

>>There is a speed that any object will fly, no matter what the wieght.

Absolutely incorrect (not just your spelling).  Think of a simple wedge
shaped car, with no air beneath it (e.g. the banned ground-effects 
racers from the 80's).  

In order for the car to fly at some speed, you must have *positive*
lift,
otherwise known as negative downforce.  Wings and airdams are
constructed to provide positive downforce--not only does this prevent
them from flying, but allows cars to corner at higher G-forces at
speeds where the aero is a factor, as it's actually pushing the car
DOWN onto the pavement.
