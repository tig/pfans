Subject:  PCNA option codes




<snip>  I just went looking for option codes on

My option codes don't seem to match my car very well, either.  I have full
leather, limited slip (confirmed by my mechanic) and side moldings but
they're not listed on the option code sheet in back of the car.  Nor are
they on my CA (Cert. of Auth.) from PCNA.  However, they DO list CO2 (O2
sensor).  That was not an option, that was required in the USA cars.  PCNA
didn't give me much of an answer when I asked about this.

There must be some sort of logic to it but I don't know what it is.
