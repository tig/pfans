MIKE,

	Replacing the shocks on a 928 is a major pain!  You will need a 
alignment after.  One of the problems is the top A arm on the front, it 
has to come out with the shock/spring and that ain't easy.  Actually the 
really tricky part is putting it back in, hold the A arm and shock with 
one hand then start one of the nuts on the top of the shock, then try to 
put the A arm bolts back, it won't go because the spring is in the way, 
it fits when all is installed!  If you take it to the dealer they might 
try to sell you new top front A arms.  You can't replace the ball joint 
and you will ruin the rubber boot when you take off the A arm, no there 
is not a 928 part # for the boot either.  But Audi 5000 parts will 
replace the ruined boot, add a little grease and parts # 432.407.377A,  
431.407.384A and 431.407.383A.

	Of course if the ball joints are bad you will be out a extra zillion 
bucks.



	Check the front ride height, mine was really low, don't know why, if you 
are alot lower than stock you will want sport springs or spring 
adjustments



	DEVEK has a shock kit, they send you shock's mounted on springs and you 
send back your assemblies.  The advantage?  you won't need to compress 
your springs to move them to the new shocks, that is a large portion of 
the job!  This would make the rears somewhat easy, or like a normal 
car......



	I installed Boge original shocks, I only paid $5,000 for the car so more 
than $1,000 for shocks seemed like alot of money. Now I think I should 
have spent the extra bucks, it would have made the job so much easier!
