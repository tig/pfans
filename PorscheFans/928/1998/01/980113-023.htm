I like the sounds of it.  I don't know how many people could attend the
time trial, though, if it was on a Friday.  It took me ten hours to
drive there (N.E. Connecticut)  I would have to leave Thursday and stay
somewhere for three nights.  $100 in gas, $300 for motel, $125 for the
day at the track, so by the time I feed myself I've spent $600.  That's
a set of R1s!!!

I have the windshield antenna in my '85S. IMHO it works extremely well.  
Wrapped alongside the antenna cable near the connector is a small black wire.
This must be connected to +12v to power the RF amp for the antenna.  In my
aftermarket setup, this is connected to the aux power trigger lead (usually
blue) that is also used to trigger on the power amps.  
I do not know what determines if this antenna is fitted.  There is no option
code.  Perhaps it goes with a particular radio code.  I am told that this will
come with a replacement windshield.  Perhaps one of our cars has had a new
windshield.
Hope this helps.
