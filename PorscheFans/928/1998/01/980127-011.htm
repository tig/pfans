  True, the weight of the 928 exists by design, but that design didn't 
  specify weight to keep the car planted on the ground.  The weight is 
  a result of the components which make the car a luxury GT.
  
  CART and F1 cars tip the scales at less than half of what a 928 weighs,
  yet they obtain +200mph speeds without flying.  A 747 outweighs our cars 
  by a bit while it reaches heights I hope my car will never see.
  
  The key to staying planted or flying isn't weight; it's aerodynamics.
  
  Your buddy in the Camaro got airborne because something caused a substantial
  area of the flat underside of his car to be presented to the air stream.
