My neighbour is an hotel manager and can confirm this.  They had a lot
of room
trashed and that is why they do not accept cash for registration.  If
you want to
pay with cash, that is OK.  but you pay on your way out and they still
have your
# if the room isn't really there anymore.

They want to insure that the black helicopter can track you down... ;-)
