Barry,
I had this happen a few years ago on my '78.  The culprit was the clamp
bolt on the shift rod, just where it connects to the transmission.  The
bolt screws into the rod from the shifter and has a pointed end that ente=
rs
a conical depression in the transmission shift rod.  There is a universal
joint adjacent to the bolt, and then there is a rubber boot covering all
this. It is a bear to get to, since it is above the trans, but it can be
done.  Mine was almost falling out, by the time I located the trouble.  I
took it out, cleaned it, put on locktite and screwed it back in.  Tightly=
..=20
I think I had to use an open end crowfoot socket to get it done.  You can
slide the rubber boot away from the bolt for access.  Hope this helps.
Dave Nicholson

 It seemed to be driving fine beforehand.  Second question posed to all y=

else would you recommend.  You guys already came through with one of the

greatly appreciated.  I wish I could provide additional background on the
problem but I am very confused as to what it might be and far from as
mechanically inclined as 90% of the folks on the list.  Thanks for your
speedy reply - I am trying to take care of this during the weekend.
