Yesterday afternoon I decided to live big and fire up the snowblower and
clear out my driveway.  Under the snow is a hard "pavement" of about 2 1/2
inches of ice that extends from my driveway doors to the town road about a
quarter of a mile away.  And I mean it is GREEN ICE.  Bear in mind that my
driveway is crushed bluestone and the surface is now billiard table
smooth.....enough, you get the point.

I decided that I couldn't resist the urge, need for some shark time.

The car fired up easily, as usual.  I let it idle for a few minutes, and
then gingerly backed out onto the driveway, and turned the car around.  So
far, so good.

The tires on the car were new in September....oh, two or three thousand
miles, not more. They are Dunlop Sp4000 with their all season rating.  My
driveway is flat for about thirty feet, andthen rises, turns left and then
goes down to a right turn, and then rises again for about 100 yards and on
to the county road.  All ice.

Into second, and ease forward.  Slowly, probably too slowly, but the car
climbed the first rise, until about twenty feet from the first turn, and the
right rear wheel started to lose grip, then the left until it sort of clawed
its way to the head of the rise and the left turn.  "A bit faster at the
bottom, and it would not have slipped at all," I thought.

Now the right turn and the next shallow rise.  There is no where to go here,
as to the left is downhill sharply, and it will take either May or a tow
truck to get the shark out if I can't make it.  Careful!  OK! all the way up
and now, the clear town road is in sight!

Glorious.  Bright sunny winter day, and I went to the village to run my errands!

Getting in and out is about as bad as it will ever get, and I now know how
this car will perform under theworst.  When I came back in, Istopped in
front of the garage as I always do, and then carefully approached the
doorway.  The edge of the concrete floor is just high enough above the
driveway surface so that I can scrape the nose pan of the Porsche going in.
I eased the car forward until the front wheels touched the concrete....and
sat there while the rear tires spun at idle.  

I have gone into all of this because of the number of posts about winter
driving that have appeared over thepast two days.  I have now driven my car
through a sudden and sharp snowstorm, and found it to be stable, but only a
flick of the throttle away from doing ..ah..atheletic things.  Now, my
excursion on glare ice tells me that with great care, on extremely slippery
surfaces, the car can make it.

But make NO mistake.  It is my opinion that trying to use this car as
regular transportation during winter weather is courting disaster, both for
you and the car. Even with narrower wheels and pure winter, or studded
tires, the car still remains VERY low. Because of the power available, when
added to the mix of snow and ice plus the idiots driving their Chevy
Celebritys with bald tires and worn out windshield wipers who are trying to
hit you at every opportunity, I think that driving the 928 in the winter,
except for long trips is simply not worth the risk.

My advice:  buy some little old lady's VW Jetta to use as an everyday car.
By all means use and enjoy the 928 when it is fun to do so!  Don't risk
crinkling it:  there are simply too few left in the world, and they don't
make 'em any more.
