Is it really the factories that are offering chromed wheels, or is their
dealerships (who have the chroming done locally)?

Richard,

AutoThority chips advance the timing and adjust fuel mixture for the motor so
that you get a few more HP out of the car with a very easy change (ok,
installation of the chips is not that easy).  Borla is the exhaust
manufacturer who makes very nice and expensive aftermarket products to
decrease back pressure on the motor and also slightly increase hp.  Both very
nice although I have only experienced the AutoThority in my car.  Helped tons
over their older version of the chip that was in my car.

Ken,

I agree with your assessment.  Al Reed is a great guy and does great work and
I also highly recommend him to people.  He in fact does some of the work for
Wheel Enhancements and Robert Wood.  He did a great job stripping and
refinishing my Design 90 track wheels.

This should be answered by Patrick but he is out of town for a few days.  He
is in the process of finishing up a conversion to Chevy 383 stroker in a '79
5spd.  He is using the Renegade Hybrid kit if I am not mistaken and it has
taken him months to get it into the car and get the car running.  Should be
worth it once he is totally done.
