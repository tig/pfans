A few years ago, I managed to find window tint which
was light sensitive.
This way, you get improved visibility at night.
Also, the police are most concerned about visibility
at night.
I put it on my front windows, with limo tint on the
back.
Not on the 928, but on one of my previous vehicles.
I prefer a clear view of the enemy.

 Congratulations and best wishes.  I hope your new audience are not in the
 habit of dropping peanuts.

Andy,
The apropriate local vernacular for that particular agricultural product is, I
believe, "goobers."  I can't be absolutely certain, as I've already packed my
Good 'Ol Boy/English dictionary in the carpetbag.  More linguistic
peculiarities: The wildly popular local hockey team (in Louisiana???) is named
the Mudbugs.

I would not, however, worry about the sophistication of the audiences in this
400m population community.  It's a quality ensemble; good enough that it has
managed to attract the 20+ year concertmaster of the London Phlharmonic and
BBC Philharmonic, Denis Simons, as their music director -- just in time for
their 50th anniversary.  It is amazing what one can learn over two decades
just five feet from Solti, Haitink, Giulini, Boult, Bernstein, Britten, etc.
