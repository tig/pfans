Perhaps the real question is why the dealer and other charge so much?
Aside from the connector, there is nothing remarkable about these
silicone wires that I can find.  I doubt he connectors cost that much to
produce. 

I picked up a set of new wires from a parts dealer in NY last fall for
$105.  The wires are exact clones of the original wires I took off the
car.  The connectors had BERU on them.  I've only put a 200 miles on
them since then, but no complaints so far.  I don't have the name handy,
but they always advertise in Pano and Excellence.  If I heard the name,
It would click.  

I have found the service at Vertex to be spotty and the people on the
phone to be at both ends of the "customer focus/service" extreme.
However, Vertex has some of the best prices.  If you can deal with the
guy on the phone, make sure they have the item(s) in stock when you
order and pay with a credit card.  

I had one item in my order that was not and waited four weeks before
cancelling the order myself.  They also charged my card the day I
ordered it even though it was not in stock.I was not told it was out of
stock when I ordered.
