If the voltmeter is erratic, bouncing high, then the wiper on the above
mentioned potentiometer (shunt) is going bad. Its just a cheap 100 ohm
PCB potentiometer, under $2 at Radio Shack.

I have a drawer of 100 ohm fixed resistors, only they are not. It was a
really really bad batch ranging from 15 ohms to 35. Its been about 5
years since I was in my dash but I think 42 ohms was what I decided my
928S needed and after a bit I found two "100 ohm" resistors in series
that work just fine. If ever someone else has this car apart and knows 
what they are looking at, that might cause a couple of minutes of 
confusion.

'83 928S
