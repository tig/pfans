>>I was told by a friend that Steven Speilberg had bought seven
928's for his wife in different color combo's so she would have a
different color for each day in the week. Does anyone know if this is
true? My friend swears he read this in Road and Track or another car mag
in 1994 or 95.<<

James,

I was fortunate enough to meet Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw about
five years ago, and was invited to their home in East Hampton, NY.  If he
or his wife are fans of the 928 it wasn't evident back then.  At his home
(which is just considered one of his summer homes) he has an eight-car
carport (didn't even see a garage on the property).  And all he had in the
carport at the time were two BMW 318i convertibles, a Toyota FourRunner,
and (if I recall correctly) a Town Car or Cady.

He could certainly afford to buy 7 928s if he so desired, and it would be
nice to think that he did.  He is real down-to-earth and a genuinly nice
guy.  It would be great to think that we both share the love of a great
car.
