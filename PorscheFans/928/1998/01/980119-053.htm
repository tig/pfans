Chihiro,

Welcome to the ranks of proud 928 owners and this list!

I don't know any R.I. mechanics but your clutch will probably cost around
$1000-$1500 to replace all components (2 disks, center plate, throwout
bearing, assorted bushings.  I got my parts from Vertex in Miami.  They had
the best price at the time (1994) for the Sachs package (everything for
~$700).  A local Porsche mechanic did the work for me for $320.  I've put
30,000 miles on it since then with no sign of wear.

BTW, your English is fine.  You have an interesting name.  Where are you from?
