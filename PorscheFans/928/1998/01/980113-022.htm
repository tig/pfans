Dear fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

Belive it or not, I am already making plans for the next "Frenzy".  Before I
proceed much further I want to get some feedback from the prospective
attendees (you). As it stands now, the event will be at AutoThority in
Fairfax (northern) VA on 9/26/98 (Saturday). Basically, it will be a
continuation of last year's program (but improved). 
I am considering adding a driving event to the Frenzy. We may be able to use
the Jefferson Circuit at Summit Point, WV on 9/25/98 (Friday, all day).
Naturally, the cost of the driving event will have to be paid for by the
participants. My rough cost guesstimate is about $125 per person for a full
day of spirited (but legal) driving. I will need to establish how much
interest there would be in doing this. We would be sharing the facility with
another club, but we could have two full run groups (four 20 minute sessions
for each group) all to ourselves if enough of you say you want to do it.

Also, the Sunday after the Frenzy may either be a Concours or a Rally or
both. More on that in the future. Send me your thoughts/comments/concerns on
any or all of the above.

Before I sign off, I want to request that those of you working on
establishing a 928 Club get in touch with me. We need to have something in
writing, about our plans/goals, for inclusion in a 928 International
Catalog.

Happy motoring. Ed
