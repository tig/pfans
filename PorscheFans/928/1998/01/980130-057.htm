How can you possibly read the current thread on aerodynamics or the bitin=
g
corrections on punctuation and  grammar, and wonder why many others do no=
t
post?  Personally,  I get the wisdom of Leonard, the experience of Vince,=

the enthusiasm of Phil, and the knowledge of Stephen, and I am too
intimidated to post as I am still a newbie and have not yet earned the
right to give advice.  Hell,  I'm still learning all the wonderful
characteristics of this awesome piece of machinery and am concerned about=

passing on improper information.  The only thing that I know for sure is
that Brian Buxton takes care of his clients, (personal experience. Thanks=

again Brian!), and that this list is one of the first things I read for
important, and entertaining info.  I found DEVEK through this list and
recommend everyone patronize the 928 Mecca. No I am not getting a kickbac=
k.
I just love visiting there. Kindred spirits & all...  As to actually givi=
ng
something of substance,  to those few that have recently inquired as to
what to expect if you purchase this car, go find a 928 in your area and
test drive the car. In my case I had fantasized for years on owning a sha=
rk
and had an idea of what it was going to be like.  The car did not live up=

to my fantasy but after owning it for 3 months now and learning the quirk=
s
and the joys of this machine,  my initial disappointment has turned into
sheer joy.  I wouldn't trade it for anything!! I'm sure you'll end up
feeling the same way.  Try to find someone who is knowledgeable in our
cars,(perhaps a kind soul from this list that resides in your area.) and
have them look at your potential purchase with you.  You'll be WAAAAY
happy.  =
