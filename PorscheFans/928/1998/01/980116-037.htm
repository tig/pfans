From Ed Hackett's article at:

http://alicudi.usc.edu/~jan/vw/FAQs/faq.oil

Multi viscosity oils work like this: Polymers are added to a light base 
(5W, 10W, 20W), which prevent the oil from thinning as much as it warms 
up. At cold temperatures the polymers are coiled up and allow the oil to

flow as their low numbers indicate. As the oil warms up the polymers
begin 
to unwind into long chains that prevent the oil from thinning as much as

it normally would. The result is that at 100 degrees C the oil has
thinned 
only as much as the higher viscosity number indicates. Another way of 
looking at multi-vis oils is to think of a 20W-50 as a 20 weight oil
that 
will not thin more than a 50 weight would when hot.

Multi viscosity oils are one of the great improvements in oils, but they

should be chosen wisely. Always use a multi grade with the narrowest
span 
of viscosity that is appropriate for the temperatures you are going to 
encounter. In the winter base your decision on the lowest temperature
you 
will encounter, in the summer, the highest temperature you expect. The 
polymers can shear and burn forming deposits that can cause ring
sticking 
and other problems. 10W-40 and 5W-30 require a lot of polymers
(synthetics 
excluded) to achieve that range. This has caused problems in diesel 
engines, but fewer polymers are better for all engines. The wide
viscosity 
range oils, in general, are more prone to viscosity and thermal
breakdown 
due to the high polymer content. It is the oil that lubricates, not the 
additives. Oils that can do their job with the fewest additives are the 
best.

Very few manufactures recommend 10W-40 any more, and some threaten to
void 
warranties if it is used. It was not included in this article for that 
reason. 20W-50 is the same 30 point spread, but because it starts with a

heavier base it requires less viscosity index improvers (polymers) to do

the job. AMSOIL can formulate their 10W-30 and 15W-40 with no viscosity 
index improvers but uses some in the 10W-40 and 5W-30. Mobil 1 uses no 
viscosity improvers in their 5W-30, and I assume the new 10W-30. Follow 
your manufacturer's recommendations as to which weights are appropriate 
for your vehicle.
