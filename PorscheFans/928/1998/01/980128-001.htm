Just a note of thanks to Gene and subsequent mailers on the subject of 
the drowned BMW.

I'm certainly going to drive my S4 very carefully through fords and 
large puddles in future, the potential consequences of failing to do so 
had never occurred to me before and I very much doubt UK insurance 
policies cover us for such damage...you can just imagine the laughter 
down the phone.

Also, my starting problems seem to have gone!  Apparently fixed by 
replacing the starter motor relay or cleaning all earthing points (which 
one I may never know...).  Many thanks to all the people who've made 
suggestions on this topic, the dealers had to eye me with respect as I 
actually suggested things for them to consider, instead of just handing 
over the keys and a blank cheque.

In my opinion, the value of this list cannot be overstated.

91 S4  Metallic Velvet Red/Linen (now starting first time, every time!)
