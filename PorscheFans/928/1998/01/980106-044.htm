Stephen,

I can confirm that they are indeed the same car - the Sport and the SE.  Mine
is exactly as you describe, with the spacers, the upholstery and all the rest. It
has the "Sport" logo on the rear.  But I also have the ORIGINAL factory invoice
from when the car was sold in 1988, and Porsche sold it as "928 SE".

Hence the 928 Performance Portfolio is indeed refering to that car.  It caused me
a lot of confusion when I bought the car and it wasn't until after I'd finally taken
the plunge and bought it that I confirmed what it was - when I cleaned out the
paperwork in the glove compartment all the original documentation was there.

Where did you hear that only 30 were made?  I believed it was 150.

Regards,

Philip Adamson
'88 928 SE
