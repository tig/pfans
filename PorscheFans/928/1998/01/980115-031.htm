Since not even El Ni=F1o will bring the air temperatures in LA down to -50,
or even -5, do what the factory recommends and replace this oil with Mobil
1 15W-50, which is a much better match to your climate and to genuinely
hard use of the engine.

Patrick...

First off, the vacuum does not act on the master cylinder's piston directly.
The brake booster is just a pneumatic amplifier, and it uses a vacuum as
"muscle".  More precisely, it uses differential pressure as muscle, that is,
the difference in pressure between atmosphere (14.7psia) and the lower
pressure (vacuum) being generated inside the engine's manifold (which
obviously varies with throttle position and engine speed).  This differential
pressure acts on a diaphragm which is connected to the master cylinder piston
mechanically.  When you depress the brake pedal, you open a port in the
booster servo and atmospheric pressure is admitted into one side of the
diaphragm which causes it to move (low pressure is on the other side of the
diaphragm) until it reaches a position proportional to the stroke of the brake
pedal and closes off the port which prevents the diaphragm from continuing to
move.  The farther you stroke the pedal, the farther the diaphragm strokes
(that's what a "servo" does).  Since it is connected to the master cylinder
piston, the piston also strokes proportionally to the brake pedal motion,
which in turn applies more hydraulic pressure to the vehicle's brake calipers.

Secondly, your rear rotors should be cooler than your front rotors... the
front brakes do more work to stop the car, they therefore also must get
hotter.
