If you want more bass, you will not gain anything by replacing the factory
speakers, which are actually pretty good besides their lack of low
frequencies.
I would recommend installing a subwoofer, and an additional amplifier to
drive it.
You will have trouble finding a sub made specifically for the 928.  There
used to
be a company called Z-box and another called Classic Research that made
custom enclosures for exotic and sports cars, but I'm not sure if they are
still in
business.  The Ultrasmith, located somewhere in NY, might also have
something.

Your best bet would be to find a specialty car audio shop near you and have
them
custom-build one.  This will not be cheap, but what is on a 928?  Actually,
my favorite
location for a subwoofer in this car is in the spare tire storage area.  You
can fit two
eight-inch woofers or one 12-inch in this space and lay the carpet back over
it (the
low bass frequencies will pass through the carpet with no problem) and it
will look
completely factory, without taking up any of the already limited cargo
space.  Of course,
you'll have to take out the spare tire.  Some people are initially reluctant
to do this, but I always ask them "Would you really want to change a flat
tire on this care anyway?"
"And if you did, you certainly wouldn't want to use the temporary spare."
That's what
cellular phones are for.  I've done a similar installation in my own 928,
and several
others for customers.  If executed properly, it will make a NIGHT AND DAY
difference
in the sound of your stereo system.

Or... you could throw a "bazooka tube" in the back and forget about it, but
that's kinda
like putting Wal-Mart tires on it  :)
Email me if you need more information, or you can call my office at
(918)582-9424.
