Howdy y'all (Texan for hello),

I replaced the two high pressure hoses about two years ago. The estimates for
the hoses were something like $650 (hoses only). To put the long hose
on, from the condensor along the passenger side fender, along the fire wall,
and to the expansion valve is a lot of labor. The shop did not bother to quote
it to me (and I did not ask). 

I removed to hoses myself and took them to an independant
automotive AC shop (which is owned and operated by a PCA member) who rebuilt
them for $50. He had to reweld new barbs on the connectors. The AC lasted
a year and half and apears to have lost all freon again. The AC goes out every 
September and this year was no different. I'll be taking the car back to him
to diagnose what is leaking now.

I'm always leary of any shop which does not work on Porsches. I've always have
bad luck dealing with non-Porsche people. I would not be using this particular 
AC shop if the owner was not a Porsche owner. Porsches are not your average
car and average mechanics should not be working on them.

Hope this helps,
Brian Scudder
