American International Racing makes good fiberglass. I had an 'S4 look' AIR
nose and tail on my convertible when I bought it. Mark at 928 International
may still have them.

I decided to put Factory nose and tail on the car because I prefer the
protection of the aluminum bumpers (the front one apparently wouldn't fit
under the fiberglass nose) and I prefer the RIM-injected, flexible covers
because I drive in the real world.

S4s have a different mounting contour than early 928 bumper covers. Both
the front fenders and rear quarters are cut horizontally into their
respective wheelwells. There are others who believe you can attach S4
bumper covers with tape, but in my case (and that of everyone I know who
has done the conversion), I had the fenders and quarters cut and flanged to
bolt on the new covers.

You will need to cut the aluminum bumper bar to fit the new nose (not a big
deal). Additionally, the taillight housings do not clear the inner panels
in the rear, so you will need to 'clearance' them in some way. (Both AIR
and IFC make modified rear panels to solve this problem without metalwork).
The exhaust outlet cutout in the bumper cover is moved several inches
toward the center on the S4. I solved this with an S4 rear muffler, but you
could also reposition the existing muffler, if you don't mind the 'wrong'
tailpipe sticking out.

Remember, there is a lower 'spoiler' panel on the nose, new body-to cover
seals, plus all different lights. This is neither a trivial nor an
inexpensive conversion using Factory parts.

Remember, thisis unlikely to increase the value of the car to anyone, and
may well diminish it for a lot of prospective future owners (moreso with
fiberglass, IMHO). So proceed at your own financial risk.
