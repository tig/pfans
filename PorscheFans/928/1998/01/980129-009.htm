Yes Andy 
but you must also remember that the more people you pack into the car the
lower the altitude of the air intake tubes so the denser the air so the
more fuel you burn so the faster you go, you also have the advantage of
having less air go under the car reducing lift and in fact the overall drag
coefficient.
I reckon with ten or twelve people in the car we should be able to hit the
200 mph mark no problem.
