Dear 928 Porschefans.

has 80k

I have seen a number of adds like Kevin's, with the abbreviation "LSD",=20
Can anyone enlighten me on what it means?

I am currently seeking a 928S/S2 in the UK, I would love an S4 but =
haven't got the dosh, must be Right Hand Drive (as we drive on the =
left). Does anyone know of any 928S2s for sale in the UK?

I had my first drive in a 928 the other day, a fairly cheap 1980 5spd =
928S, 129K miles, I am now convinced that a 928S/S2 is the car for me, =
it's a matter of finding the right one at the right price. Next week I =
hope to get a look at and drive an 85 S2 (Auto), 85K miles.

I have seen statistics stating that 77% of UK 928s have Automatic =
gearboxes, I have always driven cars with manual gearboxes and fancy a =
manual 928 for the better performance and driver satisfaction, does the =
Auto box take away the driver satisfaction, comments please?

I drive my cars hard, using plenty of revs through the gears, is the =
manual box up to it, I have heard that manual boxes can have problems, =
but I don't know what. Has anyone heard of or got any experiences to =
share, comments please?
