I understand your concern, but this is a hoax.  There is no such virus
capable of doing this.  A virus would have to be sent as an attachment or
something similar that you yourself activated.  There is no way a program
can start itself.  I have seen messages of this type several times and have
always found them to be a hoax.  It simply isn't possible.  Typically, the
"virus" is a chain letter that someone wants to stop so they tell everyone
it is a virus.  It is totally bogus.

Later...
