>PS - can anyone recommend a source of the front spoiler? Dan Johnson

Dear Dan and all the rest of the "Land Shark" tamers:

928 Int'l has them on sale for $250 (new). Also, they have oil filters for
$3.25 ea.

At present, the "Blue Shark" is at Wagonwork getting a face lift. In the
meantime, I'm driving a  Contour. Don't ask. Once I get the 928 back, I plan
to upgrade to Koni shocks. I expect a HUGE  improvement over OEM sport
Boge's with over 123K miles on them. Autocrossers, watch out!

Recently, my driver's side lock failed. No repair was possible. Sent my
spare key to 928 Int'l, 
and two weeks later got a used and rekeyed lock. I'll be installing it when
my "shark" comes 
back from Wagonwork.

Mobil says that their synthetic can go 25K miles between oil changes. For
liability, they say 
follow the recommended drain interval in the car's owner's manual. I drain
it every six months 
(about 4k miles). I blend in 5W30 and 10W30 in the Fall, 10W30 and 15W50 in
the Spring. YMMV.

Happy motoring. Ed

<< Will Stuttgart magazine be a worldwide distribution thing or are you
 Americans going to keep it to yourselves??
 I'm sure all the list members look forward to a little more coverage of
 our great machine.

Kevin,

Yes we will do international subscriptions.  An international subscription is
$46.00(US).  Call 704-843-0598(sorry, but I don't know the US country code) or
send subscription information to:  Stuttgart Magazine, 8 Woodlawn Green, Suite
150, Charlotte, NC  28217.

We have a couple very special 928's coming up in future issues that I'm sure
all will appreciate.  We are always looking for cars to feature so if you have
one or know where one is let us know.
