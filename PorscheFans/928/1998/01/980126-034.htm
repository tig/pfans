Thanks to all who responded to my question on Nology Spark Plug Wires.  The
vote seems to have gone against this product in favor of other possible
upgrades.  
Several of you had good things to say about Magnecor.  At least I'm down to a
choice between two (Magnecor vs. Jacobs).  Behr and Bosch also get metioned.  

On another subject, I have also wondered why my *From:* does not get posted.
Perhaps the listmaster can explain this.  I suspect that this may be inherent
in the way America On-Line does the e-mail thing.  For the record, if anyone
cares, it's DeMille@aol.com.  BTW Dave was able to cut through this because he
e-mailed me directly.  How did you do that, Dave?
