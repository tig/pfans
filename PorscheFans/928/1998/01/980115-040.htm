Dear fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

I certainly hope that the 1996 993 C4S and Turbo brakes are better than 1995
or older 928 brakes. However, that is not a very fair comparison. When I
said my 928 (S4) brakes were better than  911's, I was comparing a 1986 928S
to a 1986 911. In fact, the comparison would still hold true right up to the
late 80's or early 90's.

Regarding race pads vs. street pads, I KNOW FOR A FACT that my race pads are
better than my street pads even when they are cold. The fisrt time I apply
the brakes with race pads, I nearly have to take the seat belt from within
my chest. The reasons I don't use them all the time are: cost, dust, and
noise.

Cross drilled rotors are used for racing and high performance cars because
they do an excellent job of dissapating heat and allowing the pads to
de-gas. On the track, when the race is over, race teams discard those rotors
and install new ones before racing again. On the street, you won't likely
abuse them to the point of fracture. Repeated track use however, may lead to
fractures. Like I said, I have failed a few cars because the cross drilled
rotors had severe fractures in them. (I have been (and still am) a tech
inspector for the Potomac Region for 6 years.)

Happy motoring one and all. Ed
