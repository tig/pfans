First many thanks to everybody who answered my question how to buy a user
928. 

According to the suggestions I've checked the car thoroughly (83 euro spec
928s manual with 140k). 

The car seemed well cared for, clean interior and engine bay. First small
glitches come light, slow window motor, interior light,  electric mirror out
of order, AC does not operate correctly. They seemed to minor problems - as
I was intend to fix these by myself - comparing to the smoke come out of the
engine at the first startup.  The car was sitting for 4 months. We (the
seller and me) went to a car mechanic immediately and changed plugs, checked
injection, measured compression. The compression was acceptable. After that
the white smoke was even bigger and the exhaust was black. It had two 8" dia
exhaust pipes. 

We went to a test run to let the engine warm thoroughly and to burn out the
exhaust. During an hour drive (including a short 130 mph highway run)
acceleration, brakes even the gearbox was fine.  We stopped and checked the
smoke. There was no white smoke but shocking amount of gas seemed to come
out of the exhaust even at 950 rpm idle and when we raced the engine the
smoke was too gray for me. 
Finally we didn't make the deal. Any opinion?

Yesterday I've checked an other car, a 82 928 automatic with 80k. All its
little gizmos are working except - of course - the headlight adjuster. The
engine is clean, and seems has no oil leak. The only problem is that it has
a relatively new paint job. The owner said that the old maroon was dull and
he repainted it to yellow. Anyway  we didn't find any trace of a previous
accident and body repair and it looked quite attractive in yellow. 
I have a question about the transmission. It has the 3 speed automatic and
the car feels lusty till I reach 30mph. Then smashing the pedal I can feel
the shifting and the car goes crazy, accelerate like hell. Is it normal?
I've read that the 4 speed box starts in second and engages first only if
you smash the pedal. Does the 3 speed box have similar feature?
