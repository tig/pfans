I just spent the last two weeks in Boston, freezing my butt off & driving an
underpowered rental car, waiting until the day I got back home to drive a
real car!  last night when I got home the first thing I did was warm up the
car for a drive.  It started right up and I just went a few miles due to the
fact that I was tired.  however today was another story....  I had been
driving off and on all day, when it started coughing and surging, I barely
made it home.  When it starts, it runs very rough and surges.  By the smell
of the exhaust it is running very rich.  All eight spark plugs are getting
spark.  however removing  the vaccum line to the front fuel pressure there
was no reaction.   I'm not sure of the expected reaction of doing this it
just struck me as strange.  Oh, when the problem started, the car seemed to
run better, almost normal, at higher RPM's ( normal for running rich).. Any
ideas?  I plan on towing to the shop on Monday and really dig into the
problem...
