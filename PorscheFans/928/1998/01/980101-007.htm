Prev. owner told me that the 928 jack was missing so I finally bought a
used one from Oklahoma Foreign for $60.  Yesterday while looking for a
better place to stow the two spare belts, I checked behind the tool tray
and noticed for the first time what turned out to be the original jack
bag with jack inside (probably never before removed from the car).  I
don't need 2 jacks so would like to sell the one that didn't actually
come with this car: used genuine original aluminum OE jack for 928S4
(probably OE for earlier also - I can check), excellent cond., with OE
bag, $60 + ship.
Thanks,
Fred  (tel. 619-566-5000 or 259-4801)

PorscheFans:

I am on the search for a 928 and am seeking some advice from anyone willing to
help. I have a great deal of experience with Porsche both water and air cooled
also recently having sold my 944 in hopes of finding a 928. I am focused in
the years '78 to '84 primarily due to pricing and availability. I would
appreciate any pitfalls to avoid for certain years, especially related to a
manual transmission problems. (Due to a recent Excellence magazine market
report of all early 928s) 

I realize that these cars are very different from any other car bearing the
Porsche marque, this is mostly the reason for the interest. Are the 928s
basically on par with 944/951 series speaking in terms of maintenance? Also
any help with what to examine both physically on the car and the service
records would be of great help. Thank you in advance.
