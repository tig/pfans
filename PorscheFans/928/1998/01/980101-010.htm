Yesterday I drove a '97 540i with the 6-spd. manual trans. to see how it
compared with my '87 S4 5-spd.
My impressions are that the BMW is very fast with a "turbine-like"
quality to its engine's performance; its steering, shifter and pedal
controls require only a light touch; and it's quiet.  An excellent
sedan, I would  say, especially under about 80-90mph.
BUT, if you're looking for superior accel., braking, and cornering over
around 60mph, the S4 is clearly the better tool.  Actually I was
surprised that the 928 seemed so much stronger given the impressive
specs. for the 540i motor.  Also, I hadn't previously driven a six speed
trans. but I now think that the 540i might be better with only five
speeds (maybe the six cyl. BMW's would benefit more from that extra
gear).
A month ago I drove a 4 speed Tiptronic 911 C2 - that's a pretty good
idea and  the newer 5-speed versions might be a very good trans. choice.

Anyway, that BMW's one more car I now don't need to get too worked up
about.  (If they introduce an "M" version, that could be a different
story.)
