Hey all.  Since there are always a few posts about winter storage I
thought I would retype an article that just appeared in the KY Region
PCA newsletter.  The article is a reprint of an article in the PCA
newsletter "Bahn Stormer," Nov. 1997 by Bruce Anderson.

Tech Bulletin:
1. If the vehicle remains in storage for more than 3 months, remove the
spark plugs and disconnect the coil wire from the distributor.  Ground
the coil wire using jumper cables.
2. Squirt 3-5cm of engine oil into each combustion chamber.
3. Reinstall spark plugs and torque to 25-30 Nm (18-22 ft-lb)
4. Do not connect spark plug wires and crank engine for 5-8 seconds.  Do
not operate gas pedal.  Reconnect spark plug and coil wires.  Do not
operate engine until vehicle is put back in service.
5. Seal the air intake ducts and the muffler tailpipe using towels or
duct tape.
6. Check headlight & windshield washer fluid levels - top off reservoir
as needed.
7. Remove the batery from the vehicle and store in a cool, dry place -
NOT on a cement floor.  Recharge the battery every 3 months.
8. Do not fast charge the battery.  Refer to Tech Bulletin Group 2, No.
8801 for charging info.
9. The interior of the car must be dry, esp in the floor area.  The use
of drying agents (Silica-Gel) is recommended in vehicles with leather
interior and in areas with high humidity.  The recommended amount is 3
fabric bags of 500 grams each placed on the floor carpets.
10. Windows, doors, lids, and top must be closed. (I, Brian Buxton have
found that it is good to NOT completely close doors to save the rubber
seals, and to also put wood blocks under windshield wipers to save that
rubber as well.)  On cars with manual heating/ventilation systems, air
flaps should be left open.
11. Brake discs and brake pads should be completely dry to prevent
corrosion.  Do NOT apply handbrake.
12. Engage a gear on cars with manual transmissions to move the rod all
the wayinto the trans to prevent shift rod corrosion.
13. Be sure to check tire pressure periodically.
14. Lastly, always make sure you car is washed and waxed before storing,
and be sure to lubricate rubber seals, etc.

Hopefully there is no copyright problems with me typing this.  Just
trying to help out the P-Fans.
