You are right about the location.  The housing is held up
by 2 bolts and is located at the top front center of the engine.

In installing the termostat, make sure it i in in the same direction
as you put it out (I am not sure if it is possible to install it
reverse but it should not be done...)  Also, some thermostat have a 
small valve on the outside ring.  This should be put at the top (12
o'clock) position.  If there is no little valve, I would recommend to
drill a small hole and put the hole at the top.  This ensure that there
will be no trapped air in the system.

Also, make sure you change the outside o-ring and inspect the inside 
(Will be in the engine block) o-ring.  The inside one on my 85 was
dried out and I opted to replace it.

If you have additional questions, just let us know.
