 Dear Adam Caltraro and all of the "Land Shark" tamers:
     
You said that you found the 928 brakes lacking when compared to a 911. I
guess that is possible since it depends on how well maintained your brakes
are to that of the other 911. In my eight years of 928 driving experience, I
have reached just the opposite conclusion. Also, 911 drivers/owners that
have driven my car also say that my 928's brakes are better than theirs.

You also said that racing pads need to be warmed up to operate properly.
That is basically true, but they will work better than sdtreet pads even
when they are cold. the main problem with racing pads is the excessive dust
and the terrible screeching they make when they are cold.

I don't mean to rain on your ideal brake setup, but cross drilled rotors are
not as good as spiral slotted. Degassing is still permitted without loss of
rigidity or rotor strength. Also, cross drilled rotors will eventually
develop surface cracks that can lead to major fractures. I have failed a few
track cars as a result of this.
     
I agree that steel braided brake lines have superior strength and resistance
to swelling than the rubber OEM lines. However, keep in mind that they
should be replaced every two or three years.
     
Happy motoring. Ed
