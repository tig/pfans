Hi all,

Thanks to all who replied about my thermostat question.  Believe it or not,
upon opening the thermostat housing on my '85, I found....nothing.  I have
owned this car for almost 5 years and always thought the low temp reading
was just another electrical problem so it received very low priority on my
repair list.  The car has always run great, heat was adequate, gas mileage
excellent (27 mpg on trips).

Anyway, I put in the new thermostat (most of the seating gasket was also
AWOL - I wonder if the pieces are still in the cooling system somewhere?).
I had a he** of a time with the lower housing bolt as it is blocked by a
wiring harness that is as stiff as a pipe.  Easy to remove the bolt but a
bear to replace it without crossthreading.  I finally had to relocate (with
a prybar) the wiring harness in front of a spark plug wire mounting bracket
to get it out of the way enough to put the bolt back in straight.  

I guess there must have been a reason why someone removed the thermostat
and did not replace it.  Cost surely is not an issue.  In rather mild
(60's) January weather, the engine temp is staying just below the middle of
the range except when sitting still.  Then it climbs to about 3/4 of the
way up the range before stabilizing.  Any ideas on what I may be facing
this summer?
