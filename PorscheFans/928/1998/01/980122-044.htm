I won't presume to comment on any "risks" involved as my mechanical
knowledge is not comparable to others on this list.  However, I will
write about what I know:

The service records from my Beast indicate that at roughly 2400 miles
PO #1 took it to a Porsche dealer with the complaint that "the clutch
chatters."  The technician noted that this was a normal operating
condition.  It now has 29K miles on it and the clutch does not chatter
unless you accelerate quickly from a stop in reverse and don't quite
get the right-left foot timing correct.  This potentially validates
what your mechanic told you - that after the surfaces wear to the same
shape the chatter will stop.  Once must assume though that the
surfaces of a new clutch and plate are more similar than a new clutch
and an old plate.
