How about a plain old dead (discharged, or maybe actually dead and needing
to be replaced) battery? Check the battery to see if there's water in the
cells, then put on a battery charger. If you're in a hurry, jump the car
(use the terminal under the hood) to get started and finish charging later.

The clicking you hear is the solenoid (starter relay) protesting that there
isn't enough current available to pull it closed, let alone spin the
starter motor.

How did the battery become discharged? If it's otherwise healthy, you may
have left on some load (e.g., an interior light), or a relay may have stuck
closed (e.g., for the heater fan). If there's no extraordinary load, look
to the alternator.

From your posts, you've been doing a lot of wiring work, and you may simply
have discharged the battery by dribs and drabs, or left something connected
which shouldn't normally be (or should run through the ignition switch).
