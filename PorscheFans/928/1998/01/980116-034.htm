Oil Gurus:

My understanding of the viscosity ratings of motor oil has been this
regarding multigrades:

The initial number (the 0W, 5W, 15W, etc.) indicates the viscosity of the
oil at freezing (0 degrees C,  32 degrees F).  The reference is a standard
single-grade dino oil at the same temperature.  There is a correlation table
somewhere that shows the relationship between the SAE viscosity index and
the pour point of the oil in Standard Saybolt Units.  SSU is probably better
related to the "Pour Point" info shared by manufacturers, though.

The second number (the -30 or -50) indicates the film strength of the oil at
boiling temp (100 degrees C or 212 degrees F).  Again the reference is a
standard dino oil at the same temperature.

So does the multiweight oil actually get thicker as it warms up?  Not
really-- it just needs enough additives to maintain an equivalent film
strength to the single weight reference oil at the test temperature.


The local dealer installs 15W-50 Mobil-1  -if-  you ask for synthetic.
Otherwise they are still pushing Castrol GTX.  A bit behind the technical
times I guess,  but probably closer to what the majority of owners are still
using.


I'm throwing the tech stuff out here for debate.  I have no direct expertise
in lubricantsand so am open to comments and criticism.
