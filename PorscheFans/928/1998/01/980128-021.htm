Hi Pfans
I am looking for a SUV for my driving enjoyment.  I have lowered my 911
and put stiff springs on it, now it is no good in the snow and I can't
get chains on it, so it spends most of the winter in the garage.  Like
many (all) SUV owners I will be using it for driving to and from work
and going up the interstate to the ski areas.  I need a vehicle that I
can drive on snowy roads some of the time, dry pavement most of the
time.  I want a vehicle with a V8.  It needs to be comfortable for road
trips.  I need more interior space than my 911 but it doesn't need to be
huge, room for two and a dog.  It seems that not many SUVs have manual
transmissions, I really want a 5-speed.  It also appears that many SUVs
are short on Sport, I want to be able to pass when driving up the pass.

SO 
I figure I will get a 928.  Plenty of sport, no doubt about it.  More
utility than the 911.  Summer time use of a 928 is no problem, in the
winter a decent set of snow tires
should get me by. I have a 4wd pickup for use when the snow gets over a
foot deep.

I have found FAQs that indicate that '85 and newer are desirable
for the 32V engine and redesigned 5-speed.  I would like to use 15
inch wheels for winter (snowtire) use.

I have some questions for the oracles of 928 and Porsche.
What is the last year that 15 inch wheels will fit on a 928?
Do 911 wheels have the same offset and bolt pattern?
If relatively narrow snow tires on 15 inch wheels are fitted can chains
be used?
Is there a particular year that the factory lowered the car? some of the
earlier ones seem higher.
Has anyone out there found it impossible to use a 928 year round? if so
why?

I am interested in an '85 - ?,  light colored,  5-speed,  no
modifications.
If anyone knows of a decent example for sale let know.
