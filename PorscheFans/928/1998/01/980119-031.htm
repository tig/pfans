Moira,
As everyone who has done business with me in the past knows, I frown on
Fla. cars, and esp. 928's.  Unfortunately there is a lot of money in
Fla, which leads to a lot of expensive yet poorly maintained cars for
sale.  As you know a 928 is not a good car to buy if it has not been
well maintained.  It has been my experience, especially with Fla
dealers, that 99% of them have no idea, nor do they care, whether a
Porsche has been properly maintained (one guy actually told me that
"none of his customers would care about the service history of the car"
- which is why I'm not one of his customers!).  They usually have no
idea about the 928 at all (their selling point to me is always "it has a
V8 and power windows and a sunroof").  Well, show me one that doesn't. 
Almost all of them have no service history, and every 928 you call about
was "just traded" by one of their best and oldest customers and dear old
life-long friends.  Nonesense.  If you are having problems getting info
it's b/c the info doesn't exist.  Neither does the desire to obtain it
(I've had this problem as well from a couple of 928 owners that I've
bought cars from - luckily they were in excellent shape).  Avoid the car
and the dealer, no matter how good the deal.  It could easily turn into
a nightmare.
