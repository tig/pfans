Hi all,
        My father used to own a 1988 s4 and the color was champagne
silver on Brown leather, Is this a really rare color?, Does anyone out
there have a champagne silver color s4 (not bronze champagne silver). I
am under the impression that this was a Mercedes Benz color that could
be custom ordered, I was also told that it was painted at the Mercedes
factory.

Thanks,
J.Brown

(snip) 
the current draw is way too much for the
alternator to sustain without the assistance of a battery.  The
electronics just simply takes too much power.

Vince - if what you say is true, and the battery has to provide additional
power to drive the electronic's, that implies that the battery is under
constant load and could never charge.  To my  knowledge (limited), a car's
electrical system is not set up such that the alternator charges the battery
only to have the battery help drive the car's electrical load requirements.
This would truly be inefficient! Alternator efficiency is not the issue (no
electrical circuit is 100% efficient, not even super conductors) but rather
rated output.  The Alternator rating should be sufficient to provide enough
power to drive all of the electronics and charge the battery.  

OK I'm up to $.04 now
