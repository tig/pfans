Doesn't that seem like pouting?  Not very mature in my opinion.       =)

Anyway, I just want to add my thoughts in on this "Speedman" nonesense
(since everyone on the list has).  I can't remember the name of the
original poster (no offense meant), but I think that he is completely
justified in posting (1) one message to the effect that he was ripped
off by someone who may be in contact with others on this list.  I don't
see why everyone else sees it necessary to add their opinions on why or
why we should not be posting warnings like this.  Just read it if you
want to, trash it if you don't.  Do you all go to the post office and
raise hell everytime you get a piece of junk mail or an ad from Domino's
pizza that you don't want?  I mean, good grief.  I takes more time out
of your life to write a derogatory E-mail and send it to the 1,000+
members of this list than it does to move your mouse two inches and
click "delete," forever doing away with the offensive E-mail that has
obviously mentally scarred you for life.  Let's talk about Porsche's,
take heed at warnings (although SPAM's about E-mail viruses is a little
over the edge), and forget the whining!  No offense meant to anyone in
particular, and I do realize that the list goes in cycles in terms of
subjects, but the extent that some of us on the list go to in order to
purposely be rude baffles me (esp. in the case of repeating messages). 
Anyway, hate me or love me for my opinion, we still have something in
common.

P.S.  Speedman=bad, blah, blah, blah, yadda, yadda, yadda.
