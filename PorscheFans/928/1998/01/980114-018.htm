Mark Anderson,

Thanks _again_! I installed the dash printed circuit board last night.
From disconnecting the battery to begin the job to reconnecting the
battery after completion, 1.5 hours elapsed. I put the key in the
ignition, crossed my fingers and turned it to IG. Presto boingo! All
dash lights lit up. The odo-reset worked. The gas guage worked. The
speedo jumps a bit when it gets juice. The volt meter worked. The whole
console looked like a Christmas tree. I couldn't start the car because 
it was 10:30 PM when I finished the job and I don't want to disturb my
neighbors as this car is loud. I can hardly wait to get home from work
this evening to run around the block and see the speedo working.

Now, back to the braking dilemma. 8-(

Thanks again,
