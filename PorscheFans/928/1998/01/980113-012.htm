I had exactly the same issue after some maintenance on mine, James - the
main problem with mine was that the wear & tear on the undertray (those
things do take a beating) had ovalled out some of the holes and stressed
some threaded bits and it just basically couldn't handle being screwed into
place one more time.  The mechanic showed me - held it back in place,
drove the screw home and tugged on it and it seemed secure.  Then he
wiggled it around a bit and the screw fell out.

They drilled and created new mounting points for mine and that sorted it
out.  (Infortunately four weeks later I ran over a sledgehammer and destroyed
it completely!)

Subject:	What would you do

Hi to All,
            I just had my oil changed on Saturday and when I first drove
the car on Monday night I was driving down the highway and heard
scrapping sounds whenever I hit a bump. I pulled off the highway and
into a gas station and that's when I noticed that the protective cover
underneath the engine was hanging down 2 inches from the ground. It is
obvious that the Bastard/mechanic that changed the oil didn't put the
cover on right or didn't screw it on tight. I do think that there is
damage to the cover but I am not sure how much because it was dark when
I looked, If there is damage are they responsible for replacing it?.
What would you do?.

Thanks,
J.Brown
