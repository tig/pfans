I don't know how many of you have had the opportunity to stop by DEVEK hq=

here in rainy California,  but this morning it was very sunny and I had t=
o
go pick up a part that I had ordered, so  as I get on to the Dumbarton
bridge which crosses the bay,  I allowed the shark to swim freely and got=

that warm wonderful sensation again of what it means to own ones of these=

cars.  Anyway.., I know you guys out there know the feeling. But when I g=
ot
to DEVEK,  Mark & Susan had The White Car parked outside ready to go for =
a
spin.  I thought my shark sounded mean?!?! Mine is a sand shark and their=
s
is a Great White Shark!!!  Lord almighty!!!! If you haven't felt the rumb=
le
of that car deep in the inside of your chest..,  you have not yet begun t=
o
understand power.  It put goose bumps on me and got me dreaming of a
stroker kit.  Truth be told it would not make for everyday driving,  but =
it
would make for wonderful bragging rights.  I highly recommend you get out=

to DEVEK and feel the power for yourself.  Also,  Susan and Mark have bee=
n
extremely helpful in getting my baby up to snuff.  little things here and=

there.  I tell you.., it's Mecca for 928 owners.   =
