Hi all.  New to the group.  I'm 50 years old, a Chrysler factory trained
driveability technician currently working as shop foreman at a Chrysler
dealership.  I've been driving British sports cars all my life. Mostly
Triumphs although there have been a couple of XKE Jags and a few MGs.  I
currently own and drive a 76 TR-6 and an 80 TR-8.  I live in Michigan so my
driving time is limited to spring, summer and fall.  I have owned a few
Audi 5000 turbo Quattros and was quite impressed with them until the
constant maintenance and major failures of suspension parts ,  steering
racks, and electrical systems became a pain in the butt.  I am currently
intrigued by the Porsche 928s and 944s.  Am I looking at the same annoying
problems as with the Audi 5000? I am in the auto repair business 40 hours a
week and don't wish to spend all my weekends tinkering.  My British cars
seem to require a lot of attention in the spring and then seem to last the
summer without needing much attention.  What am I getting into with $4000
to $7000 Porshes.  928 or 944, or even 924?  Any feed back will be
appreciated.  Thanks.  Barry
.
