Rob & Gene-

Flatonia is about 300 miles from Ft Stockton (not 150 mi)  Flatonia is about
110 miles east or 1/2 way from San Antonio to Houston.  

Great Bar-B-Que can also be found in Luling at the Luling City Market -
Luling is 60 miles east of San Antonio - Luling City Market is north of I-10
on main highway at the town square.

Watch for speed traps from San Antonio to Flatonia - after that it is
usually clean sailing all the way to Brookshire (just west of Houston).

Also great open road from Ft Stockton to Kerrville.

Rob,

Congratulations on you anticipated move.  I assume that from Tucson, =
you'll be taking route !0 across the southern tier of Texas.  If you do, =
there's a tiny little village called Flatonia which is, as I recall, =
about 150 miles east of the booming metropolis of Fort Stockton.  The =
entire town  seems to consist of a gas station,  barbecue restaurant, =
and a few houses.  I'm not into barbecue anything but I stopped there =
for gas a couple of years ago and had the best barbecue sandwich I'd =
ever had.  It was about the size of a loaf of bread and had at least =
half a pound of the tenderest beef imagineable in it.  I ate it as I =
drove west from there and it was so good that I seriously thought of =
turning around and going back for several more.  Try it.

One other thing.  Somewhere right in that area there's a speedtrap =
thats' laser equipped.  I got nailed in it when the only two cars in =
sight to the horizon in either direction were my own and the storm =
trooper who cited me for 73 mph in a 65 zone.   I saw him coming a =
couple of miles away and my radar detector didn't let out a peep.  I had =
to send $80.00 to some cornball backwoods judge name Jimmy Bob
Suggins =
or something like that.  Have fun.

Subject: 83' 928 - removing panels to access speakers

What is the safest way to remove the panels to gain access to the factory
speakers in an 83" 928 so that nothing gets broken.  I especially worried
about gaining access to the rear speakers, but the doors look complicated too.
Also, any suggestions as to what types of speakers to use.  I know that the
factory replacements are 4", but I want to use larger speakers without cutting
into metal.
