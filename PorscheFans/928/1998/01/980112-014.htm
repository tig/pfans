	From Gene
	You happen to be wrong. The purpose of the battery is to start
the
	engine and in some cases it acts
	as a capacitor for the charging system.But that is all . Your
928 has 90
	amp alt, if for example you taking a long drive and you have a
powerful
	stereo which consumes 30 amps and you be cranking it.
	Which will overload your alt,you will be found on the side of
the road
	with a dead batt and possibly cooked alt. Yes you can drive with
batt
	being disconnected, as long as you don't exceed 90 amps,on the
	928 that is.I hope this been helpful.
	I work as a auto tech and many of times i come across people who
are
	confused about the charging system
	on their cars. Actually 928 is very simple compared to many cars
out
	there.

hmmm... I seriously doubt that my alternator produces 90 amps while
idling.  I think it max out at about 90 amps at 8,000 rpm as measured at
the alternator's pulley.  I'm confused as to what you are saying...
