Hey, Rob, congrats on the move/job change!  It is interesting to learn
what people do for a living, isn't it!

Too bad you are going out in February...if it were April you could stop
off in Roswell, NM and attend the first ever UFO 100 Open Road Race. 
C.A.R.S., those fine folks who sponsor the Pony Express and last fall's
inaugural Gambler's Run are adding another event to their series.

This event should be an exciting one... 50 miles in two directions of
VERY challenging road. Highway 246 just outside Roswell is the chosen
road, with lots of dipsey-doodles, blind-over-the-crest-of-a-hill turns
that are sure to leave your stomach behind.  We watched the pre-run
video tape last night and are recalculating our target average speed!

The race will be held April 19th, with several days of preparations,
practice, tech inspection, and socialization beforehand.  Anyone
interested should contact Sherri Ward at C.A.R.S., 619-440-6043.  It's a
great opportunity for some Texas/AZ/NM/& points eastward folks to
experience open road racing without making the trek to Nevada!

Hope to see some of you there!

Susan Kirby
