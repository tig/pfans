Subject: TEMPERATURE GAUGE







	HI















	There has been some question as to what the temp gauge should read?















	Well once upon a time,day before yesterday.















	My car was running hot, temp spiked once came back to normal and I was 



getting little or no heat.  So I am thinking thermostat, wow those are 



expensive compared to say a ford.  Well I didn't want to drain all the 



fluid, why do most other cars have a drain valve?  So I loosened the hose 






at the radiater, and drained off some fluid, lost maybe 2 quarts.  Made 



big mess!  Replaced the thermostat, and filled the radiater.  Poured in a 






gallon of coolant and about  3/4 gallon of water, thirsty shark.  Now I 



have never noticed a leak, so how long was it that low?







	Now the car runs with the gauge at the lower thin line and I have heat!















	The coolent is trickey to check, the hood is in the way, if you see 



fluid at the bottom of that tank then you might be a gallon low.  I have 



a new trick, fill it all the way and let her spit up the extra, green 



shark spit!
