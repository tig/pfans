James,

I wouldn't call myself the "most die hard 928 fan", but I would still not
have to give that decision a second thought.  The 928.  Flattening the
nose of the 911 and augmenting its performance with a hairdryer do not
move the engine to the correct place.  Nor does it make it add up to
everything that the 928 is.  Sure, there are better cars than the 928
in various specialty areas. (The 911 isn't one of them.) But find me
one that does everything that the 928 does and see how many of
those things it does better.

Bzzzzz.  Sorry, no contest!

Hi All,
        I was asked a very interesting question recently, "what car
would you rather have a 928 GTS or a 87-89 911 Slope Nose Turbo" and I
haven't been able to make a firm decision on which car I like more. I
think that even the most die hard 928 fan would have a hard time
choosing one or the other. Whats your call?

J.Brown

I'd rather have a GTS over a 911 slant nose turbo anyday.
