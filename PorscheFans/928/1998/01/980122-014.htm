I think it is obvious to everyone what the purpose of his post was--it 
was certainly positive, and I'll look forward to participating in that 
venue.
 However, *specific mention* was made to an individual who used his 928 
connections/knowledge/bullshit to convinve me to "OK" the shipment $1,300 
worth of our products to him for which he never paid.
 I am embarassed.  I am *personally* out the $1,300.  I only wish that 
someone else had done what I shall continue to do, and that is to warn 
others whenever it is appropriate.  Maybe $1,300 is nothing to you, but 
principles, morals, and certainly the law should mean something.

I'm sorry, but we did an extensive investigation of RM.  It is all 
true--actually just the tip of the iceberg.

(Would you like a copy of everything we found on this jerk-off?)

>While I was a police officer I learned

 Again, I respectfully disagree. I have received overwelming support for 
posting my provable experiences.  Remember, he used the 928 
connection--this venue--to do this, so there is indeed a DIRECT 
connection.

I don't think that was intended in the way you took it.

It would be most entertaining to hear any other "side."

I agree.  However, if someone else gets ripped-off through the direct use 
of a benign venue such as the 928List, then I, for one, would like to 
hear about.
