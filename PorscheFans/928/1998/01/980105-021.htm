FYI

 <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Comm.Commission (FCC)</A>
http://www.fcc.gov
  There is a very important matter currently under review by the FCC. Your
local telephone company has filed a proposal with the FCC to impose per minute
charges for your internet service. They contend that your usage has or will
hinder the operation of the telephone network. It is my belief that internet
usage will diminish if users were required to pay additional per minute
charges. The FCC has created an email box for your comments, responses must be
received by February 13, 1998. Send your comments to isp@fcc.gov and tell them
what you think. Every phone company is in on this one, and they are trying to
sneak it in just under the wire for litiagation. Let everyone you know hear
this one. Get the e-mail address to everyone you can think of.     FCC e-
mail----->   isp@fcc.gov

Greg...

If the owner is responsible for marking the "correct" stud, assuming, of
course that we're talking about a new car from the dealer, it seems to imply
that all the studs themselves are the same, at least from the factory's point
of view.  This would agree with an earlier Leonard post where he doubted the
factory would intentionally unbalance the hub (I must also concur with
Leonard's view).

Therefore, is it possible that the factory balances the wheels on the car, so
that marking the stud is required to insure proper remounting if the wheel is
removed for some reason?  While this would insure optimally balanced wheels
from the factory, it would no longer be useful once new tires are mounted and
they are balanced off the car.

Also, regarding the different placement of the wheel lock, might this have
something to do with the wheel itself, rather than the lock?  I mean, are the
two wheels different in terms of their inherent balance because of where the
factory intends the lock to be placed?

Any way, it's a thought....

Mike Holman told Jim Helman that... >My car, and
others I've spoken to, have the same dilemma.  When I check the
alternator output with a voltmeter- all is fine, even when driving under
heavy load.  It seems there are some connectors in the instrument cluster that
get
grungy and allow for false readings...  On your car, the alternator may be
just fine and the battery is on its way to the grave.<

I certainly agree with this possibility.  My voltmeter would typically read
around 12V after driving around for 20-30 minutes or so (would start out at
14V after starting).  Dealer checked it out and said all charging parameters
were nominal.  Just to assure myself that dealer was right, I hooked up my
voltmeter to the battery while driving (one good thing about the battery
location) to see what was what.

Lo and behold, my voltmeter read 13.5 to 14.0V, regardless of what the in-car
unit read.  Obviously, both the alternator and battery were both good.  Now I
don't worry when I see 12V on the voltmeter anymore, especially at night with
the lights on.  You may want to check your in-car voltmeter the same way.
