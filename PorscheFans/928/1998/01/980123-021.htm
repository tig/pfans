		So why can you let a synthetic go much longer than 3,000
miles, I only 
	change mine once a year?  Thats for another day, but if the
viscosity 
	statys the same and there is still plenty of detergent, then why
change 
	the oil?  That can be debated forever, but who came up with
3,000 miles?  
	3,000 miles makes sense for petroleum oils but hopefully oils
have 
	improved in the last 10 years.

	I suspect that the 3K miles oil change interval is total
marketing hype.  I've hear of this magic number since the mid 60s.
Remember that today's cars burn more efficiently and cleaner and that
the oil formulation has improved substantially the past three decades.
I used to own a '86 Honda where the recommended oil change interval is
10K.  Of course, having two 928s, I change oil approximately every 3-6K
miles just because it "feels right".  I'm sure the oil is probably good
for a few more thousand miles.  There's no hard set rules.  Every 3-6K
is pretty much within my comfort zone.
