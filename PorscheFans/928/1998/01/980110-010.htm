Hi all

	Just wanted to let you guys know where my reasearch is at on the ultimate
blown 928. After speaking to several supercharger manufacturers, they have
all told me that I can fit their base blower on my car (assuming it fits
and I can plumb it) running about 4 to 5 PSI of boost. The reason I can't
run any more, as you know, is because of the 928's 10:1 compression ratio.
Simply put, I can have 400 to 420 HP, without intercooler or lower
compression. Fine and dandy, but the parts I have been finding out that I
don't like are that if I slam on a blower, I am lessening the margin of
saftey inherent in the Porsche design. There is a possibility of detonation
with this scenario, if not executed properly.
	Solution? I have been told by numerous experts (and I use the term
loosely) that I must intercool the supercharger, and lower the compression
ratio. This accomplishes a few things: Firstly, with a lower compression
ratio, I can use more boost safely, perhaps 6 to 8 PSI without fear, maybe
more. Secondly, the intercooler will significantly lower underhood temps,
and chill the air running into the motor, meaning more HP. 
	Dilemma? Yes; because lowering the CR means new pistons, and while they
are busy installing them, should I go for the 6L kit? Perhaps. It would
solve the #6 problem, and rebuilding the motor with the Devek stuff would
be nice insurance for when the blower goes on. At least you would know that
the rods and crank were brand spanking new, not ten years old.
	Of course, while I've got the motor apart, shoudn't I drop in a new high
perf clutvh to take all those new ponies? It just doesn't stop!

Anyways, I figure a 6L motor, with about an 8:1 CR, and a paxton
supercharger with 8PSI of boost should make 500 to 550 HP easy. Oh yeah,
the headers and new exhaust will be in place before any of that fancy stuff
gets started.I haven't even started looking at the brakes or suspension
yet, this upgrading cycle never ends. Maybe I should save my pennies and
buy a new 911Turbo?

Opinions? Welcome.
