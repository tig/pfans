It _was_ the master cylinder. A fellow 928'er here in Austin tossed me a
slightly used master cylinder and I whipped it in last Friday night. It
took me 2 hours from start to finish (one man brake bleed and all). 

I got off to a great start...2 beers. Then I got off to a great start. I
started to pull the mongo vacuum line out of the booster. Pulling and 
rotating and pulling and POP! Wham! Forearm into the stressbar. You know
the pain. You just grab the impact spot and turn purple in the face as
you yell. Yeah? OK. Onward. Man, that job requires some special tools and
alot of patience...along with the understanding that flesh will be lost.
I _was_ a bit worried about open wounds soaking in brake fluid. Onward.

The one man brake bleed is time consuming and, once again, requires special
tools...which I couldn't get from any parts store around. Improvise. A
piece of plywood, 10"x12". A mountain bike suspension fork. Butt the head-
tube (like that? Butt? Head? same sentence? Mike Judge would.) against the 
pedal and pump the brakes with my arms on the fork legs and jam the board
between the front of the seat cushion and the end of the fork legs, get out
and open a bleeder. Yes. This sounds stupid and time consuming and it was,
but it worked and I wanted to get the job done. Two hours.

Don't worry about the 2 beers. I checked all of my work on Saturday morning
before test driving. Now, I can lock 'em up. The only problem is that they
squeel like a pig. LOUD! I used regular friction pads. I think they were
Minitex (SP?)

Any solutions for brake pad squeel? Anti-sieze? Applied where? This is the
floating frame caliper design. So just put some "goop" on the back side of
the pads where they touch the frame?

TIA,
