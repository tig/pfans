I've been using them for about four months. They replaced a set of
Dunlop SP8000's. My rationale for those tires was that I tend to
drive the car year round, in Massachusetts where we have snow
from time to time, and I have a separate set of wheels with R1's
on them for the track and autocross. So I cared a bit less about
dry road performance than about dealing with wet and snow and
ice.

Compared with the SP8000's, the RE940's have:
1. Better performance in snow, but are still pretty poor relative
to a cheap FWD car with mediocre tires.
2. A little less "tramlining" on a rutted section of Rte. 128.
3. About the same noise level, neither tire being bothersome.
4. A little less cornering power in the dry, but a little more
in the wet (these are pretty subjective judgements).

They don't have enough miles on them yet to say anything about
wear.
