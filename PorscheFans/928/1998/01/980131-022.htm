Last week, I spent over two thousand dollars for a transmission repair =
job due to a damaged shift fork (worn away preventing shifting into =
first and reverse).  The description on the invoice is as follows:

	25 Units of Labor @ $75/hr 	1850.00
		Trans Repair 5 spd
		R&R Rear Suspension and transmission.  Clean transmission/remove top =
cover and repair worn out shift fork on inside shifting mechanism.  =
Reinstall 		transmission and rear axle - make run.  Trans has limited =
slip.

I am fairly confident that the only way to do this job was to remove the =
trans - however I wanted to get some idea if these is the standard =
benchmark of time for this job (damaged shift fork/1st & reverse).  Does =
the above price seem reasonable?

I may try to contest this if I find it to only require 15 hours work =
instead of 25.  If this is what it costs, so be it - I knew when I =
acquired the shark that I would be dropping a little cash anyway.   =
Thanks for your help - I am always shocked at how quick I get replies =
from you guys when in a pinch
