     My S4 has 110k mi. and I have no record of a filter change, besides   
     ZIMS had them on sale for $13.

     Since purchasing the car last Jan. I have steadily undertaken many of 
     the maintenance type replacements you have mentioned except the timing 
     belt, which at 110k is about due anyway.  My efforts have been slowed 
     however since "Baby" wants a new house, which is currently under 
     construction.  Rest assured, I have staked out the garage for the "red 
     racer" and have planned many mechanical encounters of the Porsche 
     kind.
     
     Which reminds me, while knocking my head around looking for the fuel 
     filter, noticed the outer CV boot on the rear drivers side is torn.  I 
     am pretty handy with a wrench and was wondering if this is a job I 
     could take on myself (87.928.S4).  Any advice on procedure and what 
     else I might replace or checkout while changing the boot.
     
     I have not located the fuel filter for sure, due to lack of time, but 
     I did have time to identify the cover plate located on the bottom of 
     the fuel tank (passenger side).  I plan to look underneath it at my 
     next opportunity. 
     
     >I would remove the fuel pump fuse, start the car and let it run until
     >it dies before I disconnect the fuel filter.  You won't have about a
     >gallon of fuel squirting all over the place...
     
     Great recommendation, safety first!
