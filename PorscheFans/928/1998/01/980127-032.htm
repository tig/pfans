Sorry, Paul - no offense intended.  But I do think there is a difference
between you with a reputation as a legit businessman paying cash for a car
vs. someone I've never seen before in my life showing up at my house with
a fistful of money.  Maybe I've just been watching too much television
recently (of course I'd rather be driving my 928 than sitting in front of
the Tube, but the weather here in Michigan hasn't been cooperating).

As for cash being legal tender - I am reminded of a true story that 
happened
a few years ago.  The CFO of the company I work for went to New York to 
give
a presentation to a group of Wall St. investors.  When he tried to pay his
hotel bill in cash, the hotel refused to accept it.  After an arguement,
they did agree to accept the cash... but insited on seeing his ID!
