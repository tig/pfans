 (Sorry about the delay on getting back to you; we all went to MacWorld 
Exposition in San Francisco for the entire last week to exhibit. Just got 
back 5 hours ago.)
 I have been using this mod for 4 years on street and saw no detrimental 
differences on the street under any conditions.  Fact is, that car makers 
*want* the front wheels to "lock-up" first, for various reasons, and this 
is still the case even after the mods.  I think this still happens due to 
the relative size of the pad/rotors between the front and the back--ie, 
more grip proportioned to the fronts.
 Good idea about the next owner, but I will probably never sell the car; 
most likely it will be wrecked/cannibalized long before then (like 
hitting the wall at Texas World Speedway).
