This group is such a kick. You've helped me tip toe through a minefield
of issues already as I trouble shoot my new '88 928 S4, and I've only
been hooked up with you for a few weeks. And reading the daily digest is
giving me a sense of support I really appreciate as I get to know my new
car.
An update on the poor reception/windshield antenna/factory Blaupunkt
debate I may have started(or re-ignited, more likely). I had a
relatively new Alpine CD/receiver in my 944 that I basically swapped
with the Blaupunkt "Reno" from the S4 as the easiest way to verify
whether the antenna location, or internal booster/connections, or the
Blau's electronics were at fault for the poor reception I was
experiencing. And, Presto, Chango, the 928's system sounds great! Not
only are the speakers better than the 944's, but the front separates
were not blown as I had suspected. That Blau was just not up to par on
several levels, and appears to deserve the derision that so many of you
have forwarded. However, in yesterday's digest there was an explanation
that perhaps casts a fairer insight into the state of Blau-ness
currently(but one that I'll choose to avoid for the time being.)
So now I'm on to replacing torn CV boots and a thorough 90,000 mile
checkup, and then I hope to be able to enjoy the sensations (and sounds)
of unmitigated 928 driving for a while.
