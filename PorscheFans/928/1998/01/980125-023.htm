Here's a little item that should warm the cockles of your heart, =
whatever they are; and make most of you feel lucky by comparison.

This past Thursday, Palm Beach had 9 1/2 inches of rain between 1 a.m. =
and 8 a.m.  A record for this place that gets more than it's share of =
rain, although usually in the summer months.  Probably El Nino rampant.

At any rate, early that morning my son in law drove my grandson to =
school and many of the local streets were flooded.  After dropping the =
little terrorist off at his school, he attempted to go around the block =
and go home.  He entered a street that was flooded about a foot deep. He =
attempted to blast his way through this and the engine in his new BMW =
740 IL died immediately.  I went there,  only a couple of minutes away, =
and tried to start the car.  The starter grunted a couple times and =
died.  I assumed that he had run the battery down trying to start it.  =
Mind you, that he is a brilliant businessman and international banker, =
whose extensive breadth of knowledge totally excludes anything more =
mechanical than a Zippo lighter.

I called the local Beemer dealer and they sent a truck out and =
flatbedded the car back to their hideout.   My son in law and daughter =
left the country a few hours later to play golf in the Dominican =
Republic.  I forgot about it.  They came home  tonight and he called and =
said: "Did the dealer call you about repairs to the car?"  I told him =
that I hadn't heard anything since they had called me Friday and asked =
permission to work on the car because a little water had come up through =
holes around the pedals etc. just enough to dampen the carpet, and they =
were afraid that it might cause a disagreeable odor if they didn't dry =
it out properly.  I told them to go ahead and forgot about it.

Tonight when they returned, he had a voicemail message from the dealer =
stating that the repair bill was $17,000.00 because there was a hole in =
the engine caused by hitting the puddle.  I figure I could hit the =
Atlantic Ocean at something approaching the speed of sound without =
making a seventeen thousand dollar hole in my engine. What the hell does =
a seventeen thousand dollar hole even look like? (absolutely no  pun =
intended). I'm going over there in the morning and whisper sweet =
nothings in the ear of John Dillinger, their service manager.=20

The only truly negative thing I feel about driving German cars all these =
years is the fact that most of the dealers seem  to be direct =
descendants of Atilla the Hun.
