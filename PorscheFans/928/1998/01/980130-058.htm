I've noticed the recent postings involving aerodynamics and weight. One of
the aspects of the theory of relativity states that as something approaches
the speed of light, it's mass increases, and it also gets smaller. As you
accelerate your 928 up to the speed of light, it would get smaller. Smaller
size would mean less area to cut through the air, so less aerodynamic drag,
and also more mass pulling it downwards at the same time. It ought to
handle pretty well, but your local tire dealer may not stock tires with a
light speed rating., so you may have to shop around some. An added benefit
would be that, due to the Doppler shift in the frequency of the spectrum of
visible light, traffic lights would appear green instead of red. An
excellent defense in any courtroom for running a red  light!

Another aspect of the theory of relativity states that as your 928
approaches light speed, time would slow.

A few years ago, I remember seeing video tape of a high speed police chase
involving a big old Lincoln on a Texas highway. At somewhere around 120
m.p.h. the front end of the Lincoln lifted to the point that the front
wheels were literally over a foot off of the ground. The driver eased off
of the accelerator, and the car eased back down. Big old Lincolns are
heavy, but apparently don't have very good aerodynamics, and therefore
can't go that fast.

Could that be why you see so many of those cars, especially the ones going
10 m.p.h. below the speed limit in the left lane, being driven by old guys?

Conclusion: Drive fast in your 928, stay younger.
