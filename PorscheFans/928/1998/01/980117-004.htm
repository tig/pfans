928 GT:
THE PORSCHE
SPORTING GRAN
TURISMO

The 928 GT represents the ultimate reward for the high performance driver.

Adding a further dimension to the performance ofthe 928 Series, the 928 GT
takes the 'Gran Turismo' concept into the highest realms of dynamic driving
pleasure.

Providing pure exhilaration whilst losing none of the 928 S4's unique
sophistication, the 928 GT is exclusively available with a 5-speed manual
transmission, with a shorter final drive ratio to maximise the performance potential.
A short Sport gearshift is also fitted to encourage superbly swift and precise gear
changes.

Whilst the 928 GT shares the same powerful 5-litre 32-valve V8 engine as
the 928S series 4, it is specifically uprated for even greater performance potential,
delivering a massive 330 bhp (DIN) with enhanced all-round responsiveness.
Capable of a top speed of over 170 mph, this modified engine powers
the 928 GT from 0-62.5 mph in only 5.8 seconds.

As with the 928 S4, the 928 GT can be equipped with a controlled 3-way
catalytic converter with no loss of performance. This converter is extremely
efficient in removing environmentally harmful gases from the 928's exhaust emission.

Its effectiveness was proven by comparing the 928's exhaust emissions with
those of a saloon car (complying with European Emission Regulations 15/04) with
an engine a quarter of the size and not fitted with a converter. At around 85 mph, the
emissions of the smaller car were found to contain ten times as much carbon-monoxide
and nitrogen and even thirty times as much hydrogen sulphide.

To handle the increased power, the chassis of the 928GT has been selectively
modified from that of the 928S series 4, reflecting Porsche' s vast range of racing
experience. 

Changes to the suspension include stiffened gas-filled Sport shock absorbers
and uprated springs. The rear track is widened by 17mm for impressive stability
whilst wider wheels and tyres add to the 928 GT's phenomenal roadholding abilities.
Measuring 7.5J x 16 at the front and 9J x 16 at the rear, and fitted with 225/50 ZR 16 and
245/45 ZR 16 ultra-low profile tyres respectively, the advanced pressure cast
light alloy 'Design 90' wheels provides the 928 GT with a unique identity. These wheels
feature enlarged openings which are designed to channel cooling air away from
the immensely powerful disc brakes.

Naturally, in light of its sporting capabilities, the 928 GT is also equipped
with the unique new PSD electronically controlled, variable transverse rear
differential system. 

These chassis and transmission enhancements ensure
that the exceptional power of the 928 GT can be easily and effectively applied to
the road.

Yet for all of its sporting performance, the 928 GT is no raw racer, but instead
shares all the same sumptuous standard equipment of the 928S series 4.

928 GT: THE
PINNACLE OF
SPORTING
PERFORMANCE

The 928S series 4 has been acclaimed as the 'fastest car anyone's ever likely to
need'. Porsche's response is to raise the performance potential of the 928 Series even
higher and the 928 GT is the spectacular result.

The more sporting character of the 928 GT results from specific developments to the
powerful 5-litre, 4- valve per cylinder, V8 engine.

These modifications raise engine output to a formidable 330 bhp DIN (243 kW) at 6,200
rpm. Sharing the same muscular torque as the 928 S4, the 928 GT also produces 430 Nm but at a higher, more vigorous 4,100 rpm.

With the increased engine power combined with the lower rear axle drive ratio,
mid-range and top-end performance are even more sensational allowing the 928 GT to respond instantly to every driver command.

These dynamic enhancements have been achieved through the installation of a
modified engine management system and a fine tuned air intake system. Uprated
camshafts with revised valve timing have also been fitted whilst the rev limiter has been
raised to 6,800 rpm. 

The light twin tail exhaust system allows the driver to hear as
well as feel the difference of the 928 GT.

The engine of the 928 GT shares with that of the 928 S4, a unique air intake
system to ensure optimised engine performance. 

This system automatically adjusts the air inlets in the nose section to ensure maximum engine cooling during high thermal loads in
accordance with speed and aerodynamic efficiency.

Three-stage movable inlet flaps located in front of the radiator and two
variable electric fans situated behind the radiator regulate the rate of airflow.

These electrically adjustable flaps will only allow sufficient air into the engine
compartment as is needed for maximum engine efficiency and air conditioning
requirements. 

When thermal loads are reduced, this automatic regulation closes the inlets,
ensuring optimised engine temperature for efficiency and fuel economy as well as aerodynamic effectiveness.

The 928 GT is a remarkable car even by Porsche standards. For the most demanding of
sporting drivers, it offers outstanding levels of performance, roadholding and
everyday driveability combined with superior levels of comfort and luxury. It is truly the
Porsche definition of 'Gran Turismo'.
