<<Tonight when they returned, he had a voicemail message from the dealer =

stating that the repair bill was $17,000.00 because there was a hole in =

the engine caused by hitting the puddle.  I figure I could hit the =

Atlantic Ocean at something approaching the speed of sound without =

making a seventeen thousand dollar hole in my engine. What the hell does =

a seventeen thousand dollar hole even look like?>>

The hole is probably from sucking water into the intake and having the piston
charge into a solid wall of water instead of a nice vapor of gasoline.  You
probably have whole in the cylinder or piston.  It isn't uncommon in the 7
series after '88 body style.  Maybe they put the intake in a vulnerable place.
