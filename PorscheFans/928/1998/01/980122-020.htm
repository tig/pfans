The ignition tumbler _can_ be re-keyed. I had this done to my 79.

When I bought the car, there was no matching key for the ignition.
All I got was one key that unlocked the passenger's door. That's it.
Anyway, the PO (a local Porsche repair shop owner who actually
owned the car for only about 1 month before I bought it) had simply
pulled the electrical connector off of the back of the tumbler and left
it to dangle under the pod. He plugged in another switch and he used a 
flat blade screwdriver to turn this switch and start the vehicle. I
followed his example for a while. Then I contacted the PO _before_ him
in an attempt to find the original keys. That guy stated that he'd lost
the original. Then I asked him how much he sold the car to the shop
owner for. $600! I paid the shop owner $2K and _thought_ I was getting 
a good deal...if only I'd known. 8-(   Oh well, back to the re-key.

I used the VIN to get an original key cut by the local Porsche 
dealership. This key only opened the hatch! At some point in the life
and death of the hybrid, almost every lock had been replaced. So, I
pulled the pod off and took the ignition tumbler out so that I could
have it re-keyed to accept the original key. [good story on *that*
comming...]

Disassembly:
BEWARE! Removing and reinstalling the tumbler is very tricky and
requires good problem solving capabilities. 

First off, there is a pin that holds the tumbler from above. It is 
press fit through a "boss" on the Aluminum cast. 
------------------     DO NOT PUSH THIS DOWN! ----------------
It pulls out. I used a flat file to remove enough of the boss so that 
I could get a set of vice-grips on it. 

Next, as you pull the tumbler out, the steering wheel locking mechanism
will come apart and lock the wheel. This is all controled by a pair of
nautilus shaped washers and a spring which pulls the steering wheel 
lock inward towards the axis of the steering wheel. You're going to 
have to watch closely as you pull the tumbler out. Even then, you're
going to have to figure out for yourself how to get it all back
together. 

Reassembly:
I used a screwdriver to push the end of the steering wheel
locking mechanism outward and then put the nautilus shaped washers in 
so that they held the locking mechanism in its unlocked position. 

The next trick is to understand how the tumbler aligns/interfaces with
the lock and slide it in so that the match is made. Then put the pin
back in through the cast and into the tumbler. Pop the ignition's
electrical connections on, bolt it up and test it out.




Oh, yes...the "good story" on the tumbler re-key. I went to the local
Porsche-knowlegable locksmith. I dropped off the tumbler and, as I
was leaving, I asked how much it was going to cost. The employee did
a quick chart lookup and said, "$18.50". Cool! The next day I had a
voicemail message. The employee said that he'd screwed up on the
estimate and that it was actually going to be $28. Hmmm... Well, the
next day after that I got another voicemail saying it was ready. I
headed over to the shop and a completely different employee was 
ringing up the work. He looked at me and said, "That'll be $78".
WHAT!!!  Uhm...no. I was quoted $18.50 and that's what I'll be paying
you. This guy proceeds to explain the complexity of the re-key for the
high security locks. My attitude was "Too bad. You made a mistake on
your quote." They went back and talked to the manager and came up and
said, "$18.50"!

Anyway, the driver's door, IG and hatch all now work off of the VIN key
and the passenger's door is still on the mismatch which came with the
car. Close enough for now. New key --> $17.  Re-key IG --> $18.50
BEAT THAT!

Sorry for the ultra long post.
