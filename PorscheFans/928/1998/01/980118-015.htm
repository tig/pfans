Ohh boy, I was hoping you wouldn't say that!!!

Exterior window trim:
-  How is it attached to the door?
-  Do you have to take the internal door panel off to replace it?
-  Did you have any luck finding it from someone else than Porsche?

Internal:
-  Really don't know what to ask, but I want to get my windows back to
smooth operation.  what did you have to do?  I know that there is a roller
that commonly breaks and that there is felt along the tracks that comes off
and allows the window to get scratches in it.  Anything else?


Thanks
