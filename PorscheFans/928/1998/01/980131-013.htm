Hi All (one knock)

As I get this digest the day after the original postings, alot of topics have
quite amazingly already been addressed by someone else (usually one of the '15
active' aka 'Knights of the Round Digest') who seems to get the postings in
real time; often  there are questions, answers, responses to answers, etc.
within one digest, so one feels a little late in adding to the same thread.

Further, imagine 1100+ members all posting something the same day. I wouldn't
miss this great source of information and entertainment for anything, but that
would _really_ keep me from work, and, being self-employed, I would soon run
out of money, then would have to sell the shark, and that wouldn't be nice,
would it?

Anyway, here are some comments/questions:

1. 928 literature

Some members have been inquiring about a book called 'Project 928', which I
would also be greatly interested in. Living close to Stuttgart (50 mi as the
sparrow flies, 70 mi as the shark drives), I called the publisher mentioned
(Motor Verlag). Seems the book was published about the time the 928 was first
released and they have been out of stock for ages. No further editions
planned, as you might guess. Maybe this will change as our sharks are now
getting more popular again(?). (I recently joined the first dedicated 928
club, founded at the end of last year(!).)

2. Brake upgrades

There is always some discussion about brake upgrades. No one has mentioned
this very cheap and effective upgrade: First some background: One of my senior
partners is a specialist on hydraulics, ABS and the like, and does a lot of
patent work for that other car company in Stuttgart. He told me that a lot (up
to 30 percent) of the hydraulic force you (or the servo) exert on the brake
system goes into spreading apart the calipers and, to a lesser degree,
widening the brake lines (hence the improvement in using steel braided lines).
To what degree the calipers are spread depends on how rigid these are, of
course, in turn depending on the type of material used and the amount of
material used. Now (the plot thickens) the weak link in all this is the type
of bolt used to hold together the two halves of the calipers. I havn't checked
on the bolts in the 928, but I have replaced the 8.8-strength bolts in the
Brembo calipers of my Ducati (motorcycle) with 12.9-strength bolts (after
replacing the master cylinder and fitting cast iron rotors), and, hey presto,
vastly improved braking and the lever doesn't pinch my fingers after a couple
of hot laps around Hockenheim or the Nuerburgring anymore! So get some top
spec bolts for your calipers! Make sure about the quality (tensile strength
etc.), though, you wouldn't want these to snap on you.

3. Tires

With all the questions/recommendations regarding tires, I have not seen
Bridgestone's ZR-rated Expedia S01s mentioned. Do they have a different
designation in other parts of this planet? A brand new set of these were
mounted when I bought my pet shark last May. Gone after all of 4000 mi of
Autobahn-blitzing and back-road scratching (no burn-outs or such), but grip is
great when warm and they do let go very predictably (on public roads, tsk,
tsk. Go ahead, flame me again, Gene, my skin is made of Nomex). The rears were
down to less than 2.5 mm tread depth (at which point I junk tires for safety
reasons, stability is degraded at high speeds) and the fronts had developed
serious saw teeth (shark teeth?), due to braking deep into corners, I presume.
Still, a tire I would recommend. I recently came across the Tire Rack web site
and saw the new Yokohama Nexus tire. Looks pretty serious. Anybody still
reading this have any experience with this model?

4. Wheels

Aforementioned S01s are mounted on BBS 8.5 x 16 inch (square-inch?!) front and
9.5 x 16 inch rear wheels with OEM Porsche 21 mm spacers at the rear (fills
out those arches very nicely). They are a little scratched up from wheel/curb
interaction, though, and I am looking for some nice 17 inch wheels. I saw some
Kinesis wheels that look pretty good and contacted them, but they don't have
any dealers here in Germany I was told. Also HRE makes some nice looking
wheels. Has anyone out there fitted these and knows whether these (both) have
TUV approval (important!)? In Germany, unapproved modifications can result in
void of registration and consequently loss of insurance cover: NOT a good
thing. The price you pay for not having a speed limit (which would _you_
rather have? I'm happy).


5. Door mirrors

While there isn't much I would want to aesthetically change from original, I
_do_ like the look of the later model (GT, GTS?) 'teardrop'-style door mirrors
better. Is the replacement possible and, if so, straightforward (mechanically
and electrically)? 

6. Acronyms

While I was so far able to figure out the meaning of most of the acronyms
commonly used in this list, there are some that still baffle me (e.g. SUV).
Does anybody know a web site where these might be listed for the enlightenment
of non-US/GB/NZ/AUS list members?

7. Used parts sources

A while back someone (from beautiful Finland, I think) was looking for a
source for used (or new?) 928 parts in Germany. There is a german car magazine
(auto motor und sport, published twice a month) which has a large classified
section (pages of Porsches, mostly 911s, though). Its the largest (if not
best; I recommend 'Performance Car'/GB) magazine here, and you might find it
at international news vendors abroad. Some phone numbers I found for parts:
+49-721-43916; +49-721-554926; +49-6335-358; +49-9182-1574; +49-8345-884;
happy hunting!

8. GTP weekends

Any European list members still with me: Has anyone out there attended a
Porsche GTP weekend? I'm looking to get some four-wheeled track time and would
appreciate some information regarding your experiences. 



9. Aerodynamics (can't resist)

The 928 must be one of the few cars that would actually be more aerodynamic
(have less drag) if driven backwards (sans rear spoiler, of course). Just look
at the shape of a falling drop of liquid vs. the silhouette of a 928! You
don't get more aerodynamic than that!

10. Headlight adjustment

I have the remote headlight level adjuster (knob on drivers side in front of
rear hatch release). The left headlight does not reach full height, though. My
mechanic simply adjusted the light within its casing, which somewhat deforms
the top of said casing. Is there some way to adjust the
mechanics/hydraulics(?) which control the  headlight level? Advice is greatly
appreciated.

Ooops, lots of bandwidth used, Vince made me do it ;-)
