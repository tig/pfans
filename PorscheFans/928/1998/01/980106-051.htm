From: Wayne.Stuart@fluordaniel.com
     
     During a recent discussion with a friend regarding VWs bid for Rolls 
     Royce the topic of VWs corporate involvement with Porsche came up.  My 
     buddy is convinced that VW is the majority owner of Porsche.  I am 
     aware of some joint projects but was not up to date on current 
     involvement or actual ownership .
     
     I would be interested in any information regarding VWs current 
     involvement with Porsche.

Dear Wayne and all of the "Land Shark" tamers:

Porsche still remains an independent company, not owned by or a subsiduary
of any other company. It also trades publicly on the German stock exchange.
Many other sports car companies, i.e. Ferrari, Jaguar, Lamborghini,
Maserati, Alfa Romero, etc. have been bought-up by the likes of Ford, GM,
Chrysler, Fiat and so on. Occasionally, Porsche has colaborated with VW or
Audi or Mercedes to produce vehicles as a joint venture. This should be
interpreted as collaboration, not assimilation.

I am looking forward to meeting several of you at the P3 Expo later this
month. Although the topics are not specific to "Land Sharks" they will be of
interest to all Porsche owners.

One more thing before I sign off. I still have a few XL Frenzy polo shirts
and one XXL.

Happy motoring. Ed
