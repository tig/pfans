Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

The last posting that mentioned they had body panels for all Porsches, then
went on to list the entire Porsche series except 928! Again we have been
left out. If you feel as I do, that it is high time the aftermarket
providers of parts and accesories take notice of us, then let your voice be
heard. This is one of the problem areas that the new "928 Club" should focus
its attention on.

Another is a newsletter that addresses the specific concerns of 928's
ownership. You need not go back into these archieves very far to realize
that there is a great thirst for knowledge on these magnificent cars. The
new club should be able to provide a venue for technical information along
with step-by-step instructions, illustrations and/or photos.

At present there is no magazine that pays very much attention to the big
brother of the 911. The 928 is treated like the cousin that is overweight
and unemployed. It may get a mention now and then, but it seems like that's
done out of politeness. Perhaps the lack of 928 coverage is partly our
fault. Most 928 driver's don't do anything special with their cars. Kim
Crumb, Mark Anderson, Susan Kirby and Marc Thomas are the exceptions. There
are more of course, but they can be counted on your four limbs. To count the
number of 911 driver's that are active in performance driving you would need
a computer.

O.K. I'm off my soap box. The frustration of being overlooked has passed.
Happy motoring. Ed
