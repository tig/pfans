HI GUYS,
BEING ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT OF 928 PORSCHES (DROVE MY FIRST YESTERDAY), PERHAPS
SOMEONE CAN SHARE ,WHAT SEEMS TO BE, YOUR CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE ON THIS CAR. 
1 - WHY IS THIS CAR RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE ? 911 'S OF THE SAME YEAR COST
TWICE WHAT A 928 DOES.
2 - ANY COMMON PROBLEMS TO BE AWARE OF ?
3 - THE CAR I DROVE WAS AN '86, AUTO, DUAL AIR WITH 65,000 MILES ON IT AND
LOOKED LIKE IT JUST CAME OUT OF A SHOWROOM, FOR $12,000. IS THAT REASONABLE ?
4 - WHILE I DIDN'T NAIL IT FROM A DEAD STOP THE ACCELERATION DIDN'T IMPRESS
ME. I ONLY WENT TO 40MPH OR SO BEFORE TRAFFIC, BUT IT SEEMED KIND OF SOFT. AM
I EXPECTING TOO MUCH ?
5 - FINALLY, CAN YOU GUIDE ME TO A KNOWLEDGEABLE MECHANIC WHO CAN CHECK THE
CAR OUT FOR ME IN ORANGE COUNTY,CA ?
MANY THANKS FOR ANY HELP. DAN
