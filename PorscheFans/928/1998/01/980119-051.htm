I'd appreciate some input from some of the more knowledgeable guys in =
the group regarding the restoration of old beat up cars.

This afternoon as a favor to a friend of mine who is a mechanic, tool & =
die maker, but has scant knowledge of 928s,  I went with him to a =
junkyard out on the edge of the glades and looked at an 83 that had =
light fire damage under the hood. Visually it looked like fire damage =
was confined to ignition wires etc.

The body is dent free, white, but in need of a paint job.  The odometer =
reads 86K but from the look of the interior, I'd guess that it was the =
second time around.  Interior sucks. door panels loose, warped, and =
cruddy, same for dash.
No radio, or speakers.  Seats okay if they were cleaned up. dash and =
instrument panel salvageable but nothing to write home about.  Rubber, =
margineable, two or three tires flat, probably from sitting there for =
some time. =20

Owner claims he bought it from an insurance company after it burned.  =
Its
a five speed and theres no way of telling at this point if the engine is =
okay.

My friend, being a mechanic, thinks that he can get it running and =
looking half way decent for a two or three thousand dollars.  I've =
bought and sold a lot of 928s but they were always in good condition.  =
I'd like whatever input any of you might give.  The junkyard guy wants =
2500.00 for the car and my friend thinks he might get it for 21 or 22 =
hundred.

If the engine is kaput, are the rest of the parts worth him spending  =
that much money?  He'd like to fix it up for himself.  Was always happy =
with his Mustang GT until I let him drive the 85S I sold the other day.  =
Now he's hot for a 928 but can't afford a good one.
