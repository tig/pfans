Probably lots more...  Given the fact that coefficient of friction of the
tires can't be greater than 1.0, this means normal force (force pushing
down) must be at least equal to their maximum cornering force (which is a
very large force!)  Also, if you take the max. cornering force and subtract
1G for effects of gravity and you will be left with a minimum figure of
aerodynamic downforce.  (This means an indy car pulling 4G's in a corner is
getting at least 3 times the weight of itself from aerodynamic downforce) 
So yes, it would be very tough to pull it off of a ceiling!
