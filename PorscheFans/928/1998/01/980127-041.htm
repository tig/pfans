I was going over the interior of my '88 S4 with various conditioners and
moisturizers. I'm wondering if the dash is actually leather or just very
convincing (and embossed) vinyl?  The guy who last detailed the car for
the previous owner claims that some 928's do have real leather dashes. 
This ought to be an easy one for some of you motorheads.
Is it true?  If so, how can I tell if mine is? I've taken a preliminary
look and don't see any telltale seams nor loose edges.  I'd appreciate a
posting so I can know how best to take care of that part of my baby.
Thought I'd try you guys before I try the local Porsche dealer. 
Frankly, I trust you more.

I don't have the words to describe what an IDIOT I feel like.  I'm new to not
only this helpful website and 928's ,but to the internet as well.  The other
day I posted some questions I had on the 928 IN ALL CAPS ! For God's sake.
That wasn't bad enough. when I sent it I was expecting some kind conformation
that it was sent.  Not getting any, I sent it again,and again and again!
Pretty bad first impression,eh?  Anyway, I just wanted to apologize for my
ignorance and promise it won't happen ever again. Actually I'm a pretty good
guy.  Thanks for understanding. Dan
