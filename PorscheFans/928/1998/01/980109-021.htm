Anyone interested in the following car Email me or call: 561-835-0291

1985 928S  Metallic Bronze, tan interior, 5 speed, 50k original miles, =
looks, runs, perfectly.  Needs an oil sender according to the  owner who =
is a doctor and has  other cars.  I think he's the second  owner.  Has =
had it for a long time.  I just drove it an hour ago.  I may buy it for =
myself.  I always like to have a spare 928 around.  I've never been in a =
shrink's care but I'm sure that any one of them could find a million =
explanations for this ridiculous hang up I have about buying 928s when I =
 don't need them.  Help!  stop me before I buy again.

If anyone is interested let me know.  I can get it for $9500. and to me =
it might be worth that much just for the parts.  Or, when my 87S4 is in =
the shop, it  would be a good fill in.

Hi All,
In following the posts on batteries and alternators I noted one small bit of
alternator information that no one has yet mentioned.

Alternator rotors retain a *small* amount of residual magnetism. That residual
rotor magnetism is supposed to provide enough magnetic field to generate some
field voltage when the rotor rotates. The induced field voltage then further
exites the rotor to produce higher field voltage, etc. until the field voltage
reaches the level where the voltage regulator limits the exitation level to
the rotor thus limiting the output voltage.

Therefore, if you could rotate the alternator connected to either a dead
battery, or no battery (not recommended), the alternator should develop
voltage. Sometimes not, if there is not enough residual rotor magnetism, such
as if the alternator has not been used for a long time. Also, a severely dead
battery could load the alternator field so that it will not generate enough
voltage to exite the rotor to start the charging process. This will usually
not happen when the dead battery is jumped since the good battery will provide
the exitation voltage.

Yeah, I know, an exited rotor must be a sight to behold!

Hello everyone, Has anyone heard of BMW or Porsche buying back cars that have
put about 300,000 miles on a car with the original engine? I heard somewhere
that BMW has done that before. They take the engine apart and see what they
did right.

thanks,
