Marc, my mother tought me that if you can't say anything nice about
someone.. keep your mouth shut.... 

This list is great for talking about cars, and meeting interesting people
(boring people don't drive 928's)  :)  Lets try to keep personality
conflicts out of it.  

Sincerely,
Mike Clemens

Ravi...

Check the vacuum hoses for the cruise control system for very small leaks.

I, and others, have had this problem, resulting in intermittent engagement,
ability to accelerate but not hold speed, and probably your situation as well.
Note, the leaks can be very, very small and therefore difficult to find.

Good luck,
