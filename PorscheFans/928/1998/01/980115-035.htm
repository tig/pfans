I tried low viscosity oil (synthetic 0W-50)in my 1986 928s. The oil is
supposed to protect form 50 below to 400 degrees.

I was under the  impression that 15W50 oil was recommend for my 928, I was
looking at my 928 and my manual recommends low viscosity. but I have read
that synthetic oils do not break down as regular oils do.  15-W50 seems to
hold my engine down, I can feel it pumping in my oil pump when I accelerate.
The thin film of protection of low viscosity (synthetic) oil has it running
alot better and accelerating quicker. and since they do not breakdown I only
have to change my oil filter every now and then , this is to  clean the dirt
out of the synthetic oil, and my oil filter at 12,000 miles or more

 I was under the impression that 15W50 was best for my 928, but I read the
manual and it recommended low viscosity. I no longer feel the oil pump
working hard to pump the thick 15W50 to the engine. All I get now is sheer
accerleration. I just tried some 0W-30 and I am surprised by how well it
works. The 0W-30 will protect as well as the 15W50 and will not breakdown.
My car starts great in the morning when it is cold (it as been below
freezing a few days here in the San Fernando Valley, CA). The oil will
protect automobiles up to 400 degrees (beyond the 15W-50).
 I have been convinced and I my oil pump loves it too.


Guy give me some feed back if you have knowledge of anything to the contrary
