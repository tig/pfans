While driving home last night from downtown Seattle I approached a =
traffic light and realized that my car suddenly could not shift into =
first (reverse as well).  I figured maybe I was doing something wrong as =
it was 1 am and I was pretty tired and all.  Nope, the car could not get =
in gear and the only way to move it was to depress the clutch and push.  =


First question - has anyone had this happen to them (I need a little =
reassurance as to the potential severity of the situation).  I am =
praying that it is not a major transmission job - I will lose a little =
faith if such a major overhaul would be required for an altogether =
flukish incident.  It seemed to be driving fine beforehand.  Second =
question posed to all you Seattle residents - would Paul Weir be the =
best place to take it or what else would you recommend.  You guys =
already came through with one of the best body shops in the city =
(Bernards Imports) so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I =
wish I could provide additional background on the problem but I am very =
confused as to what it might be and far from as mechanically inclined as =
90% of the folks on the list.  Thanks for your speedy reply - I am =
trying to take care of this during the weekend.
