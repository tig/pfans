This is not a "personality conflict" issue. It is a fair warning to all
members of this list to beware of one particular fraud. As stated in Marc's
earlier message, an investigator was hired and the facts are clear...Speedman
is a fraud and will gladly rip YOU off.

Be happy that other members think enough to watch _your_ back for you.
