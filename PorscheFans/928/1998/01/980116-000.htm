This may not relate since my car is not a GT, and it being an 87'.....
Mine definitely has the sport shocks option (474) 
It has Boge shocks, but they are an Orange / Red color instead of the baby
blue you describe. I wonder if they color code their shocks like Koni and
others do? 
Just a thought.
It was mentioned that R.D. Enterprises as a good place to buy shocks....I
haven't checked on 928 shocks yet, (need to soon myself) but I bought a
Suspension Techniques sway bar and Tokico Illumina 5's from them for an 85'
Supra several years back, and they gave me a great deal as I recall. Those
were great shocks.....(5 way click adjust on top of the shocks) I wonder if
there's an application for a 928? 
The Koni's are adjustable, (3 settings I believe) but it's not an easy task on
the models they sell for a 928, unless you do like Kim Crumb suggested and
send them to Koni and have them modified to an externally adjustable type (for
an exorbitant fee I'm sure) as are available for the 911's.

P.S. .....not that it's a biggie....but would any of you guys know why my e-
mail address doesn't show up on my posts anymore?
