Ron,

Great idea!  I was just thinking about arranging an IRC meeting with a few
guys on the 928 list, but a virtual drop-in centre with regular times makes
heaps of sense.  Now, if only I can work out what time that is here in NZ
I can hide away at work somewhere and join in.

How about it guys?

Hi Porsche Fans,

I have noticed that a lot of visitors are going to the Chat Lounge site I
had set up recently.  Unfortunately people are going there one at a time,
missing each other by minutes.  I received a couple of suggestions through
the e-mail that said I should set up specific times for each type of model

example

911                  Monday 6-10pm eastern time
924-944          Tuesday 6-10pm eastern time
928                  Wednesday 6-10pm eastern time
914                 Thursday 6-10pm eastern time
356                  Friday   6-10pm eastern time
Boxster           Saturday 6-10pm eastern time

Maybe this would help us to get together and start talking P-cars.  If this
suggestion sounds good to you let me know and
I'll update the site with the meeting times,

Thanks again

How dare they impune my children!!  I will teach them....ok probably not but
here is what they said.

This is from a small bit about the new MB C43 that will be out next spring:

"The recalibrated steering, however, is too heavy, too slow, and too Porsche
928-like to be truly inspiring."

Sacrilege!!  Shows just how little they really know!

Happy driving,

OK 928 fans,

It is TWS time again...let the driving begin!!

Here are the specifics.  If you live in Central TX (including the Dallas area)
you need to hear this and come on out and see what a 928 can REALLY do when
pushed.

Where:  Texas World Speedway  College Station, TX (home of TX A&M)

When:  Feb 21 and 22 (first time drivers at this event must attend a meeting
on Fri 20th)

What is it:  High Speed Driving School (instructors provided and everything!)
What do you do:  Drive as fast as you want around a 1.8 mile 12 turn road
course that uses the front straight of the super speedway.  Yes there are
other cars (about 20-30 per run group and there are 5 run groups) but I have
never seen an incident involving more than one car (occasionally people loose
control and go off track, but I have never seen any bent sheet metal).  You
get 4 runs of about 20 minutes each on Sat and Sun...for a grand total of
about 160 minutes.

Who sponsors this:  Porsche Club of America Lone Star Region (Houston area)

How much does it cost:  $160 for the first driver (if you have a spouse that
is a PCA affiliate member she/he could drive the same car for an extra $100)
and if you want a garage space then you will need to find an extra $20.

Registration is now open for PCA members and will open on Jan 26th for non-PCA
members.  If you need more info contact Becky Laughlin at:  Laughlinbe@aol.com

This is lots of fun and beats the hell out of getting tickets trying to drive
your car to the limit on public roads.  It is well worth the time and effort.
I personally think everyone should do it at least once to see just how high
the performance level of a 928 really is.

Hope to meet you out there...email me if you are going, I like to kind of keep
track of how many 928's are going to be there.

See ya,
James Morrison
