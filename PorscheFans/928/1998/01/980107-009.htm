Wow!  Thank you so much for that post David.  My voltmeter is very 
erratic, often pegged all the way up!

Unfortunately, I had already replaced the voltage regulator twice and 
then the alternator before I took it to a mechanic.  He connected a 
voltmeter under the hood and said, "Nothing wrong here, it's your dash 
voltmeter.  You need a new one."  Boy did I feel dumb.

I've just been ignoring it since then, 'till I can get around to 
installing a new one, but now I'm gonna try your resistor thing.

Great post!  Thanks again.

Well, that's certainly a problem with the Porsche service manuals, isn't it?
The manuals cover a lot of topics, but a lot are left out, particularly
interior type stuff.  These manulas are not nearly as good as Japanese
equivalents which are very well done and provide plenty of detail, in addition
to having a lot more and considerably better photographs with easily
discernible arrows.  Porsche's manuals remind me of the early days of Japanese
instruction manuals which were translated pretty badly.  A lot of the stuff
you read is written a little backwards, making it hard to understand the
meaning.

Oh well, the manuals are still better than nothing....you really need them
with the 928's typical plethora of  needed repairs.
