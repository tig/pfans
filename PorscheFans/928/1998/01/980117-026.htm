I've got an '86 S (32V) and have a small oil leak from the hose which 
connects to the forward portion of the right cylinder head cover.  I 
have never been under the intake air distributer so I don't know where 
this hose leads.  Since oil leaking here is flowing onto my hot headers, 
II need to fix this before spring thaw.....

Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

Those hoses (there are two) are oil return lines. At idle and low speeds,
they are under a vacuum. Over 1500 RPM they are no longer under a vacuum, 
but are under a bit of pressure. to the sump. The oil you see in the valley 
of your V8 is probably due to one or both hose leaking. Usually its' the 
front one. The oil returning to the sump is very hot and over time reacts 
with the rubber. Eventually, the rubber fails. The hoses is held by clams on

both ends. The top on is eazy to get at. The bottom one will require removal

of either the fuel rail or the intake manifold or both. It's Not an easy
job.

Good luck and happy motoring. Ed

Could someone tell me the location of an accessory wire and a wire that is
energized at all times in the fuse box? I need to use wires to hook something
up and want to use it from the fuse box.

thanks for all the help in advance.
