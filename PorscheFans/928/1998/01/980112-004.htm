Howard,

I had the same problem with my '85 911. It had the original Blaupunkt
radio (I don't remember which one) and the antenna is in the windshield.
The closer I got to a major city, the better the reception.

My husband played around with it for awhile thinking that somehow
something got disconnected. There were three separate phone connections
in the car, who knows what else. I swear we pulled out 2 miles of unused
wires. Anyway we decided to replace the radio with a CD player. While
searching for the best one, we discovered that radio was the problem.
Apparently it just wasn't powerful enough. I had always thought
Blaupunkts were good radio and maybe they were in the '80's, but we went
with another brand and have had no problems. Except that I had to
memorized a 60 page manual to be able to turn the radio on!!!

Replace the radio!!!!

Moira
