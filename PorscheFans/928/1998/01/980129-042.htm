I stand by our original contention that weight has no relation to
aerodynamcis.  The amount of aerodynamic lift required to cause a car to
leave the ground will be in some part determined by the static mass of
the vehicle, but also by the weight distribution and wheelbase.  Of far
greater import is the nature of the airflow around the vehicle.  I
further contend that the corvette is no lightweight, and moreover that
you consider a course in English Vocabulary.

As at the zoo, keep your hands out of the cage.  I suggest that the
928's high kerb mass is because of a very large number of electric
motors and accessories, and the very substantial unitary steel shell
designed to protect the occupants in the event of a crash.  Furthermore
I suggest that aerodynamics play no part in the weight of the car.
