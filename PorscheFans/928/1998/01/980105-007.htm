Andrew,  your obessession with 928s has obviously grown to the point
where you are seeing them everywhere!  Either get yourself out there (and
into debt) and buy one, or get a high altitude photograph of a major city
during rush hour, where, if you squint from across the room you can
imagine that MOST of the cars look like Porsches.

A Lexus??  Tut tut.

Recently, someone had some parts listed for a 928, but he left no address or
telephone number.  I am interested in a cell phone mount for my 928.  I think
the listing stated that it is from Beverly Hills Motoring. Any help would be
appreciated!
