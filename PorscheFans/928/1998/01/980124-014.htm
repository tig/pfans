I've owned my car now for about a month and was wondering if anybody else
has run across the following:

oil leak - seems to be coming from right rear of engine - at least thats
where the small puddle on the floor is. With hood open, I can't see any
leakage looking down into the engine bay. It only seems to leak after the
car sits for about a week. Its a small leak as the level on the dipstick is
right up to the full line.

Alternator/generator whine - High pitched whine coming from alternator.
Voltmeter says car is charging okay and car starts fine even after sitting
for 5-7 days.

Interior electrical - power mirrors inoperative, passenger seatback
adjustment inoperative.

ABS warning light - comes on intermittently.

I do not have roof mount antenna so cannot uplink to the mothership. Any
suggestions would be much appreciated.

BTW, I was looking through 40th anniv issue of Panorama as it has article
by Kim Crumb on the 928. There was another article containing interview
with Ferry Porsche who said he used to drive a 928 but switched to 993
which he likes much better! Jeez, the 928 trashed by The Man. Oh well.

"Looking for a door stop to hold the door open"

Another interesting post.  Does this mean that the doors are supposed to stay
open?  All along I've assumed that it was normal for my doors to close by
themselves, since they both do that.  Have I been wrong all this time?  Tell
me it ain't so!  Otherwise it's just one more thing that needs fixing, and
what part would I need for since I obviously don't have any idea what I am
looking for.

I certainly haven't noticed any info in the service manuals, but then again
they are a little skimpy when it comes to body part information (like the
attachment points for the lower spoiler that someone wanted to know about).
