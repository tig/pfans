Well, people, it has started moving along quite nicely.  So far we've had
Andy McIntyre, Andy Gardner, JP Rodkey, M Ryan, Ken, Greg S (briefly!),
Leonard and myself online at various times for IRC chatting.  As a result
Ken already has his car accelerating better!

The Wednesday evening thing will be regular, with other meetings as posted.
Greg has suggested this evening at 8pm EST for a couple of hours for another
drop-in, so anyone who's interested, come along.

MEETING TONIGHT - 8pm EST

To get on:

Download mIRC from http://www.mirc.co.uk/qstart.html  - there are brief
instructions on this site as to how to set up the software.  Once you have
it installed set your server to:

sparrow.winz.co.nz   
 (note - this is NOT a Netscape/Explorer type server - you need mIRC to get
to it.)

then type at the command line:   

/join #928chat

and there you will find us!  Email me for more help.
