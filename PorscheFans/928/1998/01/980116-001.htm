Sorry to hear of you misfortune with the weather, yes we did see those
pictures of the transmission towers, mindbending stuff and quite outside the
experience of people over here.

To cheer you up I borrowed a friends mint black 1984 928s and went for a
drive up and down the coast where I live with the 1968 and 1997 vintage
blondes. After a quick squirt to Palm Beach (Summer Bay to those in the UK)
we had have coffee and home made blueberry muffins for two on silver platter
for about US$3.00 while sitting on a wharf overlooking an unspoilt waterway
called the Pittwater. Oh, and from that position we overlooked the national
park at West Head about 2km away, where this contry's only F1 was wrecked by
its mechanic on a 60mph testrun. (trouble with the satelite uplink, no doubt;-)

After a quick swim at the beach we went home, passing the hang gliders that
overfly our house. In a the 928 we were be able to reduce the travel time to
our local beach to about 30secs when we emerge for our afternoon swim.
Later we padded up and down the coast in the 928 just for the hell of it
seeing if the revs got beyond 2000rpm (they didn't) stopping to have coffee
and a meal when hungry.

My friend's 928 is hardly ever driven playing second string to a SUV. I
would buy it except that they are about to cut the supply of leaded fuel
over here and so I am looking to buy an S4. My friend's car has non-custom,
normal state licence plates but the registration is UFO-928. Those of you
who have driven in Australia know that there is simply no road here to
exploit the high speed ability of a 928. (See F1 note above) Those UFO-928
plates will always be sadly ironic.

Roger you may have your winters where you don't get to drive your sharks,
but over here you will never see anything like the full potential of your
shark. (It could be worse, you could own a F1)

And as far as being on the wrong side of the road goes, well when your in
the deep north over here and the road train commeth, you are always on the
wrong side of the road - it doesn't matter which side your on.

Dear Shark folks:

Having just about survived the worst winter storm in a century (perhaps),
and with a good part of the state of Maine still a federal disaster area,  I
am thinking fond thoughts of driving my 928 in the spring sunshine. 

Some of you may have heard about our ice storm.  Here on coastal Maine, we
have no snow to speak of.  This storm was all ice, and perhaps you have seen
the pictures of major power transmission towers merely snapped off like an
erector set kicked by an angry child.  From here to Montreal there are
MILLIONS of folks who will be without power for weeks yet, and it has gotten
cold.

Now, I lost power here at home for a few hours several times up until
Saturday night.  Otherwise, no real damage here.  Thus, when I think about
driving my 928, I feel a twinge of, well, not EXACTLY guilt, but the same
sort of feeling that I get when I realize that there are soooo many who
drive their Subarus ALL THE TIME, and NEVER know what it is to drive a 928.

It will be a while before I can get the 928 out again.  Right now, my
driveway is sheer ice all the half mile to the state road.  But just talking
about it is nearly as good as being able to get it out.  IN fact, I am
getting so excited that I think that I will go out to the garage and start
it up, and listen to the sound of it just getting warm.

So, Adamson, you might be just a tad lucky to be able to just go out and
drive in your nice, Kiwi summer, and I might be just a tad jealous.....but
just a tad, since you only to get to drive it on the wrong side of the road,
and that is only half as much fun.

Spring is coming!  (I think!)

Regards,


Roger
