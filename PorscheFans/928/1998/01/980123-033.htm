Generally, the new law extends the old EXEMPTION for 1965 and earlier
cars to 1973 and earlier.  This means, no smog tests ever.  This
exemption will remain for five years, then become a rolling 30 year
exemption.  That is, starting 2004, 1974 and earlier will be exempt, in
2005, 1975 and earlier etc.  The original bill called for a rolling
25-year exemption and was opposed by the bureaucratic "air quality"
interests, the the compromise is what we have.

I have a roller 1970 911 with 1973 engine that has been sitting for a
while because it doesn't run well at all.  I was stalling on getting it
registered because I didn't want to deal with smogging it.  Well, I just
took the paperwork down to CSAA (AAA) and its now registered. No smog,
no sweat.

I would suggest registering your project car before staring work as the
model year of manufacture.
You might also want to make sure the engine case is a 1973 or earlier.
The main beneficiary of the new law is the 914  and early 912 people who
couldn't find parts to make their cars smog-legal.  California law about
engine swaps has not changed.  For smog compliance purposes, the year of
the car is still the later of the engine year or chassis year.  Although
the main enforcement mechanism (2 year smog tests) is now gone, you
could still be in strouble if you dropped in a late model engine and got
caught by an over zealous curious officer.

BTW, joining CSAA has been the best $36 I've ever spent on my cars.  In
addition to the road service, they offer DMV auto registration and have
a DMV clerk at many offices.  The difference is like night and day.  The
CSAA people work for you, the member.  Try that idea on at the DMV! HA!
good joke.

CSAA has a real DMV on-line terminal and can perform almost any DMV
function having to do with the automobile's registration.   The CSAA DMV
clerk will tell you HOW you can accomplish what you need to get your car
registered and has always been very helpful to me.  My local office has
three DMV clerks, but Cecilia has been there for at least 10 years. They
cannot do anything having to do with driver licensing, nor sign off on
auto fix-it tickets (they are not sworn peace officers), but for
titling/registration/renewal, they are great.  They issue plates, helped
me for an hour to find my vanity plate "MY 928", issue registration
stickers etc.

You probably won't have much trouble modifying the existing engine.
Webers, bigger P&Cs won't even be noticed, 'cause you can point to
engine number and prove it's year.
