I had a similar problem two years ago.  It turned out that I needed a
new cable. At the end of the cable is a plastic piece (weak link) that
the sunroof sits in.  The plastic part moves the roof back and forth and
thus up/down.  When this part broke, the roof still worked, though it
would jerk ever so slightly and move at a slight angle. A plastic piece
ended up in a guide preventing the roof going up. 

Easy to check.  The interior panel is held in at the front edge of the
sunroof, 3 black screws.  Loosen them (best not to remove), then pop the
panel down, forward and out.  Close the roof.  There is one screw on
each side holding the roof to the plastic guides.  Remove them and roof
comes out with some wiggling.  You can inspect everything easily. 

While it's apart, clean out all the gunk and apply new grease.  You'll
be amazed how mush faster and smoother it moves. I used Wurth HS7000 to
lubricate the roof as well as my antenna and door hinges.  Works great.

The large bronze colored screws in the front support are only to adjust
the height, don't mess with them until your sure everything is in good
shape.  Chances are the adjustment is right as it's not likely to change
on it's own.  Most likely something else went wrong, like the cable.  If
you adjust the roof too high, it scrapes going back. It's about $400 to
repaint.  Don't ask me how I know this.  

To adjust the height if needed, place a triple layer strip of masking
tape at the front edge, middle and back of the roof.  Have someone move
the roof back slowly and ensure it does not touch the tape.  When it
closes fully and the tape does not rip, your set.
