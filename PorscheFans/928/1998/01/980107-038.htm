Hi Brian:

I sent in a check also and was one of the late ones.  Jay was waiting to
receive all payments before printing and I hope that's what the hold up
is...

Addressing this to Jay so he can respond with status!

As a shameless plug for the 928 Owners Club - I have all mousepads and
T-shirts M / L / XL in stock and ready to go!  See
http://www.928s4vr.com , 928 Pit Area for details.

I want to thank everybody for their informative responses othe fuel injectors!
It made the decision easy, I got the best people to do the job, and for the
best price.

     My next comment/ Question is,  I work with a Russian guy that loves cars
like me, and we began discussing prices of cars in Europe, Middle east, and
Russia.  New and used cars cost nearly double in some countries.  In some
countries some people are importing cars from America to take advantage of the
of the price differences.  Some counties Tax these imported cars so highly
that there is no advantage to bring in a car from another country.
   Finally this leads me to ask a question of our international 928 fans.  
What does a used 928 cost in you particular country today in US dollars?
Are there any severe government Taxes or laws in you particular country that
makes purchasing a car from another country prohibitive?  
Thanks
