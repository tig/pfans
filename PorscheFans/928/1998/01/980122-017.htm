To get new keys for a 928, you need to just give the VIN # to a Porsche
dealer.  They will order the keys from Reno based on this and within a
week or two you will have them.  Price was as reasonable as any 928
part, especially so for such an exotic key, about $20 each.  The lighted
head is sold separately, about $15-20 I think.  Not cheap, but much
better than $200.  

The key comes with a plain plastic head, but they are not assembled.  TO
assemble into either a lighted or non-lighted head, you just slide the
metal key into the head.  It will "snap in" and your done.  There are
notches in the key that get grabbed by a lock or cam in the key head. 

BTW: There is also a service/valet key available (red head) that opens
the door and works the ignition, but not the glovebox. Nice to have so
one can leave the sunglasses, etc. in the car.

I ordered a duplicate set of keys two years ago as I had just one key.
I needed to show my drivers license and registration as proof of
ownership to get them.
