 Fuel-injection drivers switch the ground side of the injector 
connection.  The other side of the injector is at +Vbat (12v). So, if 
they are 'on' all the time, then it is one of three things (in order of 
likelihood):
 
 1) The injector wiring harness has a short to ground.
 2) The injector driver (the current amplifier between the microprocessor 
and the injector, inside the Bosch box) is malfunctioning.
 3) The microprocessor is dead (or malfunctioning), and has defaulted to 
'on.'

 The first thing I would do is disconnect the harness at the Bosch end, 
and find the injector driver wires, and measure continuity to ground 
(normally, none).  I don't know the pin numbers as I don't have access to 
my 928 shop manual schematics, at the moment. I can get this later, if no 
one else comes to the rescue.
 If the problem still persists, then it is most likely #2, #3 -- a 
"brain" problem.  :(

 Good luck!
