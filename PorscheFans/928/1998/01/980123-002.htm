Greg,

Thanks for the tip on shortening my shift lever!  If it all possible, I
would like to keep the stock shifter, and it sounds like hacking the lever
is definitely the way to go.  I've never used a dremel tool, but I'll ask
around to see if anyone I know has one.  Thanks again.

P.S. I tried like hell on Wed. night to log into the chat room but just
couldn't get through.  I downloaded the MIRC software, and hooked into
"sparrow" but just couldn't connect.  I think it may have to do with the
firewall at my office??  Anyway, I would love to join you guys online
sometime.  From what I understand, it is every Wednesday at 8 pm EST.  If
you have any tips or suggestions as to the uplink problems I may be
encountering, please let me know.  All it would tell me is "not connected
to server".

Why so little magazine coverage of 928's?  Someone wrote:

Perhaps the lack of 928 coverage is partly our fault. Most 928 driver's don't
do anything special with their cars. Kim Crumb, Mark Anderson, Susan Kirby and
Marc Thomas are the exceptions. There are more of course, but they can be
counted on your four limbs.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is basically it.  Check out the ads -- more specifically, the number of
paid ad pages -- in Excellence or Pano.  The majority are from advertisers
selling performance parts, body panels, engine upgrades, etc.  Compared to
911's or 914's, we Shark people do relatively little of this, therefore fewer
advertisers.

Magazines make their money through two discreet channels, selling the
magazines to us, and selling us to advertisers.  You've probably noticed that
many special interest magazines will continue sending you issues long after
your subscription runs out.  This is because we are worth more to them as
another notch on their subscriber count than we cost them if they send us the
magazine for free.  If we bought as many parts as the owners of other Porsche
models we would, I believe, begin seen a lot more coverage.

But, hey, is it OUR fault that, with the 928, Porsche basically got it right
the first time?

zipper up."
