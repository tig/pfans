I have been reading this mailing list for a couple of months now with great
interest and I have at last collected my '82 928S euro spec automatic.  I'd
like to thank everybody who helped me with advices what to look for on these
cars. 
I can find no other words to describe the experience other than....
fantastic.
I intend to use my 928 almost daily (about 80miles to work and back), just
because I want to its such a great car.

The car has 88Kmikles on the clock and in spite of its age oly had 2 faults,
the speedo quit working during the test drive - seems to be an easy fix -
and the AC needs to be refilled. (Anyway I havent find a car with a working
AC during my search)
My only concern is that I used to drive lighter cars up to now, and the
Porsche feels really heavy till I reach 40mph or smash the pedal.
My question is how can I lighten the car without sacrifying its internal and
external look. What can I remowe without destroying its handling and
relialility. It would be great to remove a couple of hundreds lbs.
First I think about removing bonnet and interior sound insulation. What else
is removable (headlight adjuster nechanism?, AC?...) and how much weight can
I spare? Can I replace the AC with a lighter fresh air blower and heater.
Does it help in handling? Why doors are soooo heavy if they are made of
alumini.
I don't want to build a racer and don't want to tune the engine (now) but I
think less weight can help in its low speed handling. 
Any opinion or suggestion?
