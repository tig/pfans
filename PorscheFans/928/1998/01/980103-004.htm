Towing 8k lb trailers should be reserved for the likes of Chev, Dodge or
Ford trucks.  That way, you don't have the tail wagging the dog.  My
6000 lb. empty weight Ford F-250 4X4 that tows a trailer with no
trouble if the trailer is designed correctly and loaded correctly.
One of the problems with a 928 towing a trailer is that the rear end of
the Porsche is very low as compared to the height of an average trailer.
This means that the trailer will have to be tilted downward in order to
hook up to a
ball installed on the back of the Porsche.

No, I think if you want something to tow a trailer, buy yourself a used
3/4 ton truck.  It will definately work much better than a sleak 928 which
was designed to cruise the highways and byways unimpeded by parasitic
attachments.
