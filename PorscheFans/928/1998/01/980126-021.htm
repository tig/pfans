<<So, is this true?  Or were you just trying to make some other point
about the
cars' relative value to collectors, but not really related to actual
quantity
of vehicles sold?>>

Steve, et al,
A little of both.  In reference to the question of the rarity of
slantnose 930's, they are very rare.  However, they did make more than
30 units.  I added a little exaggeration for effect.  Anyway, I think
they made more than 300 GTS units from 93-96, but I could be wrong.  My
main point was that Porsche turned out very few slantnose 930's, and
most of them that are still on the market have not depreciated much at
all, unlike the GTS.  I'm not sure on exact production numbers for
slantnoses (I know they only made 24 in 1994), but I would argue that
there are fewer around than there are GTS's.  And keep in mind that my
original post wasn't lessening 928's or my love of mine, it's just an
unfortunate fact that they have terrible resale value compared to what
they cost new.
Regards,
Brian
