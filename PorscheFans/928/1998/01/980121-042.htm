	I have not done it myself but I heard that the bolts have a
tendency
	to strip if you do not have the right tool.  The recommendation
was to 
	clean the bolts as good as possible (use break or carburator
cleaner if
	necessary) then buy a high quality socket (I mean snap on or
equivalent)
	to remove them.

	Good luck and let us know how it turns out.

	The same thing happened on my '78 when I first acquired it.
bought a new boot kit from Pepboys for about $40 and the parts was OEM.
Stephane is right... you need to check the condition of the bolts first.
Insert the hex key/socket and feel for play.  If there is more than 1mm,
leave it to the professional.  You will strip the head.  The bolts are
torqued at about 60lbs.  If you're able to go this far, clean ALL parts
before reassembly.  Reinstallation is trickier than removal.
Disclaimer:  Not sure about torque and bolt head type on a '87 but R/R
should be about the same.
