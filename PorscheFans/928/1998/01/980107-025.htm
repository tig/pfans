The guy at PCNA said something like they were "still working it out".  =
I'm not sure exactly what that means, but I too hope it becomes a =
reality....=20

>I find the news exciting but it brings more confusion.  Some people at
PCNA says that the CD-Rom will either not be created or will not
be available to the public (isn't that illigal in the US??).

Also, I thought that the garage already had access to the CD-ROM version
for at least some of the car.  I have heard that they get printed page
from the CD but are instructed to DESTROY THE COPY after they are done
using them...

Hope it comes through, especially if it is reasonably price and it
would be nice if it included the parts fiche...

Now if they could only start making some new 928...
