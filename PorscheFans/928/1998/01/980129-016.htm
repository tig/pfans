Oh, that never happens *hysterical laughter*...right, everybody get up
off the
floor, and read on...

1997 Ducati 748 (sunny days)
1967 Chev pickup (most days--I live in Oregon) that really never breaks

Check out the board connectors.  Slide your seat all the way back,
remove
the thin plastic panel under the dash, and look around under there for 
vertically mounted connectors.  Seems to me there's one big one on the
left and one on the right, and a small one sideways in the middle
somewhere.
These connectors want to drift down (i.e. apart!) on mine.  I've used
zip ties
for one of them, and blue silicon on the other to keep them pushed
together.

What happens is one edge or the other drifts down far enough that one or
two of the connectors no longer quite touches....or intermittently
touches.

The boards have something like 15 or 20 pins on them.  The connector
edge works just like boards in your PC.
