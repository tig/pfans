Jason,
Coincidentally, this topic came up Wed. nite in the chat room.
I haven't replaced my shift knob with an aftermarket knob, but I did shorten
it by about an inch. There were posts regarding this about a year ago, and
there were several ways suggested. Here's what I did.......
To remove the shifter boot base plate, I opened the ash tray lid and pulled
back and up on the left front corner of the plate. Carefull, as the tabs on
the plastic base plate can be broken. Then pull the shifter knob off of the
shift lever. It may be tight, but it will pull off. (if necessary, you can pop
the gear pattern cap and squirt some armor all on the lever to make it more
slippery)  Do not cut the leather boot. 
With the shifter knob removed, tape a towel around the shift lever to keep the
mess to a minimum, and hacksaw about an inch off the lever. (The lever has c-
shaped indentations on each side that hold shifter knob on, and I sawed right
thru the narrowest part of these.)  Take the piece that you sawed off and hold
it to the side of the lever, even with the the top, and mark where the new
indentations need to be. Take a dremel tool with a burr bit, and re-form the
indentations along with de-burring the saw marks and rounding the off the top
of the lever. ( I did the dremel work with the tool inside a gallon freezer
bag to keep the metal burrs from going anywhere other than on the towel.) I
cleaned the lever up a little more with some files and sandpaper, so that the
shift knob would go on smoothly.....suit yourself here....I'm sort-of a
perfectionist. 
I did not cut any leather off the shift boot, because as it was, it was
stretched pretty tight when in gear due to the leather being dry and the
inherent shrinkage. 
In fact, I took the shift boot and rubbed it down real good with mink oil and
put it in a ziplock bag overnite.  
It looks factory, and it's surprising what an inch off the top does to shorten
the throw.
Hope this helps,
Greg Schickel
