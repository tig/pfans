PMJI:

Barring any original car documentation which denotes serial numbers, the
only way to authenticate a GT will have to come from the Certificate of
Authencity ie. the cardex info. 

Code 639 may not always appear on the build sticker in the trunk for
some reason (it doesn't on my GT and a few others have responded same
here on porschefans).  The presence or lack of code 474, sport
suspension, is no indicator as well (my black Boge equipped car lacks
this also !?!).

So, what the cardex will tell you (from my experience with the 1990
model) is:
VIN
Engine number
Trans number
Paint code
Interior code
Optional equipment
and curiously enough... the 928 GT is identified only as 928 S4

This same anomaly may apply to Club Sport / SE editions as well.

If anyone has info on shortcuts to getting the cardex info please let us
all know as one won't always have the luxury of time for snail mail when
shark hunting!

For those in the field shopping right now, verifying engine code M28.47
and trans code G28/55 is a fairly safe bet that you are indeed looking
at a real GT, but again, only the factory cardex will provide the serial
numbers.
