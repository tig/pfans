Vince- thanks for picking up my plea for info.  I'm learning a lot
from your replies to peoples' inquiries & really appreciate your
efforts.

Now an apology- wasn't the voltage regulator that "died".  It was
actually the voltmeter/ammeter in the dash pod.  Thats what I get for
surfing after beers.  Besides, I was distracted by the guy thats been
cruising around in Jalpas and M-1s.  Can't believe everyone let the
typos slide!

**Would love to live vicariously a bit more by hearing some driving
impressions/comparisons, if your willing**

At any rate, the seller claimed it worked intermittently, but its been
firmly pointed at the tar since I've owned the car.  Mechanic claims
inputs are O.K. but guage is bad.  Didn't look to me like replacing
the "guage" itself would be  a real treat.

However, my lights do dim a bit sometimes when accessories come on.
Should I consider replacing the regulator as well before it fails and
cooks my alternator?  Where is it?
