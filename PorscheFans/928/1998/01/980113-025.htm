	Yep. I used the largest profile that I could for a hydraulic
cam. So...how
	did I test to see if that was the root of the problem? Easy. In
one of my
	"what in the heck is going on here" experimental drives, I got
zipping along
	at about 45 mph, put the car in neutral, held the gas down to
get the engine
	rpm up to 3 grand and keep it there and then braked with my left
foot. Now,
	at 3 grand, I would hope I was past the point of having a vacuum
robbing cam
	overlap effect...but the brakes still were crap!

I'm not sure this would be a valid test.  Try this... put a vacumn gauge
on and do the same thing.  You'll find that vacumn drops when you raise
the rpm.

	How about this approach:

	1) The most common symptoms of a defective master cylinder are?

I've experienced the pedal to the metal effect with no resistance on my
first MC.  On my second MC replacement, there was no clutch action.
Generally the brake pressure light will come on at the end of the
travel.  Not able to stop the car in time would be a dead giveaway.  :-)
Brake fluid lost... this would be visible.  I've seen one MC where the
fluid was leaking into the brake booster; destroying the seals.

	2) The most common symptoms of a defective set of pressure
regulators are?

My limited experience with pressure regulators is on my wife's Volvo.
Rear wheel.  The rear tend to fishtail a little on hard braking.  And
the brake squeal because of pressure loss after brake is applied.

	No, I need the answers to be a little more detailed than, "You
can't stop." !!

How about a personalized license plate "NOBRAKE" to match?  :-)

	;-)

	  BTW Vince, my first car was a 66 GTO with a 73 455 SD in it!
We seem to be
	  traveling similar roads in life.

	Good taste...
