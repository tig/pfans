Well here my 928 cents worth.  PO had the wheels chromed.
3 weeks ago got ready to go to work in the morning and much to Surprise 2
front flat tires (1986.5 928) and I mean flat like clasped.
Had to jack up and remove wheels so I could pump them up.  Called my good
friend (Al Reed of Specialty Polishing).  He explained to me that after a
while water will start to eat at the chrome on the inside of the bead
causing them to leak air.  Al had provisouly polished the wheels on my 944
(Phone Dials) what a great job.  Back to the 928, took the car to Al who
dismounted and cleaned and polished the inside of the rims.  I have had no
problems since. My suggestion is not to chrome but to have the polished.  Al
Reed's price $250 for the set.

Regards
