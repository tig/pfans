	This example has always amused me - that F1 cars would be able
to drive through the tunnel at Monaco on the ceiling without falling
off.  In point of fact, I think they would fall off quite quickly if
anyone managed to get one up there, because the fluids in and around the
engine would still be subject to normal gravity.  The battery acid would
all spill out, the oil in the scavenge tank would disappear from around
the feed pickup and, unless they were running Slick 50 (yeah yeah) the
car would "cease to proceed" in short time.

	It's a fun thought, though.
