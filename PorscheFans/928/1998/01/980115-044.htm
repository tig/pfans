An excerpt from Autoworld's WEBSITE about the fallacy of thicker 15W50 oil.
I tried low viscosity and my engine loves it.


Proper maintenance goes way beyond servicing the automobile at the
recommended time or mileage. It requires the use of proper materials as
well, which leads us to the eternal question, which oil viscosity is best
and why? If you or your employees are still of the opinion that thicker is
better it’s time to wake up. Thicker may be better in spaghetti sauce but
not so in engine oil. Current technology makes it vital to understand the
importance of oil viscosity. For example, the oh so common overhead cam
engine requires oil be delivered to all cam and valve related components
immediately after start up. This is necessary because of the extreme forces
involved in turning the camshaft against the cam followers. Roller lifters
need oil quickly to protect the tiny bearings inside the roller. These tiny
bearings must absorb the pressures of the entire valve train while rolling
against the camshaft. In these examples oil will tend to cling to moving
parts and protect them for a brief time after startup. This residual film of
oil quickly disappears and if not replaced by oil from the crankcase will
lead to wear and shorter engine life. Rapid oil delivery is what makes oil
viscosity critical like never before.
When I encounter people who refer to 5w30 oil as that "damn watery stuff"
and then recommend a thicker oil, I shudder. The reality is that higher
viscosity makes it harder for oil to flow from the oil pump to the end of
the engine oil circuit. Higher viscosity also means it takes longer for oil
to circulate through the engine, which significantly accelerates start-up
wear. Consider this, most auto experts feel that as much as 90% of all
engine wear occurs during or immediately after start-up. Once you know this,
you also know that proper viscosity can be the most significant factor for
long-engine life.
Other things worth considering: In the "good old days," the machining
processes for engine manufacturing were far less precise than in today’s
computer controlled high tech plants. Less precision meant that higher
viscosity oils were needed because of their ability to take up more space
between moving parts. Today this extra space no longer exists which means
that using higher than recommended viscosity oils can lead to oil starvation
in the areas farthest from the oil pump. This problem can be worse when the
engine is hot because two things happen as the engine heats up, the
multi-weight oil gets thicker and the clearances between moving parts gets
smaller. Vehicle ncframe have the ability to measure these clearances and to
determine the proper oil viscosity for pumpability when the engine is cold
and when the engine hot.
Having said all this there is a bottom line. To protect your customers'
engines and your reputation always use the oil recommended by the vehicle
manufacturer and remember, you are not doing your customer a favor by
recommending any other viscosity. Leave thicker to the folks that make
spaghetti sauce.
