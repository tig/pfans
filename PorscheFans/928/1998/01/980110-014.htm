Fellow 928ers,
I'm thinking ahead to when spring comes to the midwest and Drivers Ed beg=
ins at Mid-Ohio!  Because I have seen that high speed driving events can =
be hazardous, I have decided to modify my 928S with a race roll bar and =
harnesses.  I know that DEVEK is planning to offer a 928 roll bar soon, =
but I don't think it is ready for sale yet.  The only other source of non=
-custom 928 roll bars that I have discovered to date is one made by Autop=
ower.  Has anyone on the list had any experience with the Autopower race =
roll bar that several sources offer?  If so, what is your opinion of it? =
 What's the best source?
I am also looking for a set of camlock, 5 point harnesses to go with the =
roll bar and stock 928 seats.  Any preferences for brands and suppliers?
Finally, I planning to switch to Hawk "blue" pads for my S4 brakes.  Pega=
sus supplier lists the front pair (HB141) for $170 and the rear (HB170) =
for $95.  That seems pretty steep.  Anyone know of other sources of these=
?
Any information on these subjects would be appreciated.
Many thanks.
Jim Fry '86 928S
