Marc,  Do you drive your car off the track?  Did you experiment with
the braking on wet (slippery surface)?

kim did explain that the bias was done for safety reason and I was
wondering if anyone felt the difference in handling while braking.

Just a paronoid comment:  If you sell the car, make sure you put
the original bias on the car or at least inform the new owner of
what you did and the possible consequences.  There is a lawyer ready to
get you at every corner...
