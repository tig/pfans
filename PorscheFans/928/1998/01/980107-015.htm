I just got off the phone with the guy that signed my Cardex from PCNA.  =
He was super helpful and answered several questions.  I mentioned the =
discrepancy on my Cardex- my car being called an S4 coupe while having =
the 85 prefix in my engine id. #.  He did some checking and stated that =
it was an oversight on his part.  He will be re-issuing my certificate =
within a couple of days.  Leonard- i did ask him about the code 639 and =
he said it's actually code 637.  He said that they stopped placing that =
designation in 1990 and it appears in '88-89 GT's and Club Sports only.  =
I also asked about the sport shock code 474 and he said sport shocks, =
springs and sway bar was a standard upgrade on the GT and therefore does =
not show up on the sticker.  Other info:  PCNA is moving to Atlanta and =
his office was full of boxes.  He is going to give me production numbers =
for GT's and S4 when the move is complete.  I asked and he also =
mentioned that they are working on putting repair manuals on CD- Rom.  =
Still working out the kinks and it probably won't be out till next =
fall....
