Some sources for racing / brake goodies:

http://www.truechoice.com <-- 1st place I found with those handle
operated brake bias regulators (pkal - before this I had no idea what a
Tilton was!)

Summit Racing Equipment catalog 1-800-230-3030
Early car owners can find a plethora of electric fans (no debate outa me
on hp differences of fan / fan-clutch drag vs. electrical requirements)

Tons of stuff for the tinkerer/explorer...

Yeah, I guess especially from roll in 2nd, the shark sets the proverbial bear
trap for those who are not in-the-know regarding its performance....(and very
few are)

Happy new year!

Just had to throw this in after seeing Oklahoma Foreign mentioned along with
928 jack.  
Fred, you probably have MY jack!  =)
Reminded me of the time Oklahoma Foreign delivered the "slightly " damaged 85
928 I purchased from them in 88. Looked pretty good in the photos they sent.
Had 19K on the clock, and it was my 32 valve 5speed that I wanted so badly.
Talked to Bob a couple times, and sent them my $10K for the car.  What a great
deal!  Said the interior was new/flawless, and that the car was 100% complete.
Just damaged as per the photographs.

Car arrived from Oklahoma to New Mexico around 10 pm one night.  My friend
Karl, another die hard Porsche guy, was with me to help unload the car into my
shop. We both knew it wouldn't roll, so I needed the extra help. 

Holy S***!  This thing had hit a utility pole SO HARD sliding sideways at god
knows what speed, that it was actually in 2 pieces.  The windshield back came
off the truck first, and then the crumpled front section with slightly bruised
engine was pulled off with a chain.  The clutch housing had snapped away from
the tube.
Karl just looked at me and shook his head. After all, the pictures looked ok?
I had built a lot of totals, and anyway, this was my dream car. ( Anyone want
to see some shots of her? I have a few on file....)  
Maybe my biggest complaint was the fact that unlike promised, the radio was
gone, as was the tool kit, spare tire and jack (  You must have MY jack--see I
told you! )and a couple of the bronze finished 16" rims were suddenly 16x6"
flat 924 turbo wheels, in silver.  Oh yeah, and a rodent had eaten a hole in
one of the seats as big as a tennis ball. Guess the photographs lied to me.  I
called Bob a number of times and listened to empty promises, and then gave up.
Guess he figured I was an idiot to buy such a car in the first place.  Maybe
he was right.
Bottom line was, 1 divorce and 3 years later, I had a spectacular 928 that was
back as before the wreck. I spent a fortune, and did everything right. The car
was incredible.  Drove it for a couple years, and sold it to a friend.  I
still wish I had it back.....
