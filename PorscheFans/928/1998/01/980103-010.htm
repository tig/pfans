I agree, but felt lazy, so said it anyway, hoping for just such dialogue. I
seriously doubt that Porsche designed any imbalance into the hub and rotor
to compensate for the Mickey Mouse wheel locks, though they might have if
the MMWLs were fitted in Germany, where the cars actually went fast enough
for all of this to matter. If they did, all those of us who have discarded
the locks are in trouble.

Reasonable on the above presumption (and you do see little balance weights
on some hubs).

I like the sound of that. The stem is light, but further from the center
(130 mm bolt circle diameter v. roughly 375 mm diameter to the stem)

>At 100 mph, the valve stem is pulling about 400 g's

Wow! I knew this was an issue, having seen the cute little brackets sold to
keep the stems form folding over (which now strike me as a good idea,
specifically to avoid imbalance at speed), but never did the calculation.
Those of you still thinking about doing vile things which might weaken your
wheels take heed; the forces at the rim are hundreds of times the weight of
the material there; it had better be strong.

Right, so we're still not explaining what Stephen Doyle read.
