My '89 Integra is 9 years old with 110K miles, looks new, has never failed
me, and it's fun to drive (no, not as much fun as the 928).

Downside - the AC never was good for much.  When it failed I didn't bother
getting it fixed.  Besides, with a 944 and a 928, I don't drive it much
when it's warm anyway.

For some reason Integras have lousy resale value (sound familiar?), so you
can find them cheap, but watch out poorly maintained car.

Of course, if the Chevette is so reliable, maybe you should talk your 
mother
into getting a new car and selling that one to you!
