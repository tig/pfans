Greetings from Oz,

today whilst shark hunting I came across a 1987s4 with its inlet manifold
and cam covers painted with some sort of cream coloured enamel, which has
flaked off in some places. My question to you is, is this a factory applied
finnish? Or has someone visited an unspeakable and stange modification on
this 928. I believed the induction manifolds were finished in polished alloy
in 32V engines.

The car's books state that the car was delivered in England with cup wheels
and a limited slip diff. It then found its way downunder in 1994. In other
respects it seems unmolested, if slightly dirty.

Should I be concerned with this car's origin being England? What is the
story regarding salt corrosion? (No snow here, but I can tell you that sea
salt spray is simply does not cause corrosion to any car that is rinsed with
fresh water)

For those of you who asked the other day about prices of sharks in other
countries, here are some numbers. Those of you in the US or UK have a good
laugh.

32V mint condition 58,000 miles, screaming bargin at US$20K sold in 3 days.
Sharks are underated here and normally take a very long time to sell.

1987s4 typically ask for US$36,000, don't really know what condition or what
they actually go for. The ex UK car I inspected today was asking US$29,000

How about US$13,000 for a 1979 928?

And to take out the condition and mileage factor lets just look at;
new 1997 911 Turbo @ US$234,000
new 1997 Boxter    @ US$84,000

We do however have 'free' health cover which I suppose is where all those
car taxes go ;-)

Before you start loading containers with sharks to ship over here just remember
1 you are too late the US$ has just gone up
2 sharks are underated here and are actually far cheaper than a 911 of
similar age and condition. Its a buyer's market.
3 we drive on the other side of the road to the US
4 we have unique design rules that the car will need to comply with to get in

I would recommend John Lippert from AIC Auto Sales (717)529-2025.

He is a one man show in PA and locates Porsche, BMW and other exotic's.
Used to sell Porsche's and will ship anywhere in the country.  I found him
listing a 928 on Traderonline.com  The car was gone but he took my name and
guess what, 3 weeks later he had located a '88 928s4 Silver 5-Speed 39,000
miles.  Mint.
