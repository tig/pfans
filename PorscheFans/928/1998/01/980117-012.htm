Dr. Bob,

There used to be a company called Z-box and another called Classic Research
that made custom enclosures for exotic and sports cars -- including
Porsches,
but I'm not sure if they are still in business.  The Ultrasmith, located
somewhere
in NY, might also have something.

The best place I've found to put a subwoofer, however, is in the spare tire
storage
area.  You can fit two eight-inch woofers or one 12-inch in this space and
lay the
carpet back over it (the low bass frequencies will pass through the carpet
with no
problem) and it will look completely factory, without taking up any of the
already
limited cargo space.  Some people are initially reluctant to remove the
spare,
but I always ask them "Would you really want to change a flat tire on this
care anyway?"
"And if you did, you certainly wouldn't want to use the temporary spare."
That's what
cellular phones are for.  I've done a similar installation in my own 928,
and several
others for customers.  If executed properly, it will make a NIGHT AND DAY
difference
in the sound of your stereo system.

There are CD changers now that are small enough to fit in the glove box, or
in the
"tray" under the bottom of the dash.  You could also cut a hole in the took
kit, and
recess the changer into it.  It may not go in all the way, but there should
only be a
couple of inches protruding -- much better than having the changer
completely
exposed in the cargo area.  I know you don't want to cut your original tool
kit -- you
can get another one from 928 Int or Oklahoma Foreign for about $50 and cut
it.
Veteran Company in CA sells OEM Porsche carpet in small quantities, if you
can't
find a tool kit in your car's color, or if you decide to build your own
enclosure.  Their
number is (213)927-2233.

As for the MBQuart speakers, I'm not sure if they still make the set you're
asking
about, but I wouldn't change the factory speakers unless there's something
wrong
with them (other than the bass).  The MBQuarts in particular are VERY
over-priced.
They're good speakers, but they should cost about half of what they do.  I
seriously
doubt if you could hear any difference between them and the factory
speakers.

Email me if you need more information, or you can call my office at
(918)582-9424.

Tony
