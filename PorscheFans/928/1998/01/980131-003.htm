Yeehaw!  Celebrating tonight - Madison's wife is pregnant with their
first child!

Come to think of it, so is James' wife (with his child of course ;) -
James owns the 911 cabrio in the Bay Bridge photo off my main page.

see http://www.devek.net   -  928 parts and technical reference.  I
think it was $19?

PO was on a budget.  I had those on the '84 and while they are the
longest wearing tire I've ever seen (smoky burnouts don't affect them)
they really do 'sing' (screech more like it) when pushed even
moderately.  Great long wearing tire though.  For more performance
oriented you could do no wrong starting with RE71's or D40's and keep
moving up the scale (money wise too).

Try Swepco in your gearbox, might help the shifting a bit without
rebuild!
