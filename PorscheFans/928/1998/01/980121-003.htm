Yes, let's hear it for all the Porschefans lists, Jim Bergman, and all
those who help provide this free service for the world.  

....

As a possible explanation for the omission, note that KJC is not
net-connected and therefore hasn't had the chance to 'swim' with us on a
regular basis, or, maybe is gagged by the PCA-specific connection?  This
could also be a reason why the 928 20th Anniversary day at Devek wasn't
mentioned as the first such 928 event in '97?  And yes we had the PCA
there too selling goods and signing up new members.  I guess this is
part of all the '...crap and bs rules and regulations...' and a bit of
why the original person that inspired me to get going on this 928 Owners
Club isn't even a part of the list anymore.
  
I apologize to all those who attended (some at great distance and
expense) the west coast day for not getting off my duff to write
something up for GGR's newsletter or Panorama, etc. but you know one
person can't do it all and I was hoping some fan would jump right in
there...  Thank God Doug was there with his camera for the rooftop
photo!  
Everyone benefits from this interaction here though not all give their
appreciation.  Maybe they should see how deserted 928-wise the Porsche
newsgroup is to gain this appreciation? 

Anyways, there will always be bumps and grinds on the road of life so
let's not take this too seriously, we're talking cars not religion (!)
or politics (!!!)  heh heh.  BUT another big huzzah for Porschefans, and
especially all of you.  

Keep the faith!
