If someone replaced only 1 burnt bulb, the difference in resistance
between the new one and the old one on the other side (ie if you
replaced the left brake light, the right brake light still has an
old bulb) might be too great.  The bulb checking system works by
comparing the resistance of one side to the other.  If they are
different, its says you have a burnt light even if it works.

We always advise to change the 2 lights at the same time.  Its cheap
and you can keep the old one in the car in case you are stuck a
long way from home...

If the problem occured after someone fooled around with your wiring
harness, i think he might be the guilty one.  You might want to check
if the pedal is caught on some wires or go back to the guy that did
the work and ask him to revise his latest improvement (or just
drive the car when it rains...)
