Now wait one second. Am afraid my employer has turned me into a
Certified Computer Nerd, and the above makes little sense to me. OTOH,
it might just be The Way It Was Implemented. (PC software is stupid this
way).

The problem is *not* MIME. MIME is a good thing. This message is in MIME
and I'm not going to apologize for it. The magic (which keeps people
from complaining, including me) is that little header above which says,
"Content-Type: text/plain", combined with the fact it doesn't say
"Content-Type: text/enriched", or html, or worst of all, "Content-Type:
multipart/mixed". Eudora (Pro and Lite) users, click on your "Blah Blah
Blah" button to see the headers I'm talking about.

Attachments are usually thought of as a different animal entirely. An
attachment is usually a way to send a file along with your message.
Usually when a mailer sends an html formatted message it uses the MIME
technique for attachments and starts out with the "Content-Type:
multipart/mixed" header. Then puts the html version in one attachment
(part), and plain text in another.

In the Bad Old Days before there was MIME the most popular method of
emailing files was uuencode. Uuencode was invented for a slightly
different reason (ever use uucp?) but due to the nature of Unix and the
ability to build new functionality by borrowing existing tools, uuencode
was found to be useful for email "enclosures". The great thing about
uuencode is that it ignores everything outside of its bounding begin/end
lines. One could simply save an email message, headers and all as a
file, then throw it at uudecode which would find its stuff. BinHex works
the same way for Macs.

When MIME encloses a file, a newer replacement for uuencode is
preferred, known as base-64. Base-64 gets the data packed a bit tighter.
Base-64 and uuencode protect your data against systems who would change
line termination, drop high bits, or otherwise alter your data. Once
Upon A Time, 7 bit data paths were common, 6 bits wasn't uncommon.
Anyway, a 7 bit serial data stream is about 10% faster than an 8 bit
data stream over the same modem. At 300 baud when paying for long
distance telephone calls, that's an important 10%.

Now to close the loop: its possible your email client disables MIME
entirely when uuencode is selected as the method for encoding
attachments. Without MIME, it has no way to tag the formatting method
used to make your text "pretty", so it defaults to plain text.

I have never had any problems sending anything other than plain text in
the message using Eudora Pro/Light versions thru 3.1.1 on the Mac, nor
version 3.0.5 of Eudora Lite under Win-32 (Win95/NT). However, if you
use any text formatting, such as font selection, font size, underlining,
bold, etc., Eudora will instantly drop the text/plain Content-Type for
something more exotic. Set your font and font size using the Settings...
menu item.

By any chance do you have a "template" or "style sheet" in your email
client? I'd bet that is where the nasty "MIME" formatting originates.
