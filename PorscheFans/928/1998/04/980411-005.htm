Ed,

Thanks for posting this!  Good work!  I went down to my local motorcycle 
dealer and had them order me one.  It took them a while to find it in 
their catalog, but they finally came up with it.  There's a sticker on 
my shrink-wrapped package that says "part no: P529  ATV SHOCK WRENCH  
VN-P# 08-029".  I peeled this off, and underneath, the original label 
says, "MONO SHOCK SPANNER  Motion Pro #08-029".  They charged me $19.99.

Seems like it comes under different names, but saying it was a shock 
wrench, made by Motion Pro, and the number 08-029 were the keys to 
finding it.

Anyway, works great!  I highly recommend it!
