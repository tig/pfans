I'd buy another car through Brian, too.  In fact, if Moira hadn't
taken that car, I was seriously thinking about being next in line.
From what Brian told me about it, it's a beaut!

Actually, I'm about 4-5 weeks from starting the search for a 928 for
my wife.  Ever since she first drove mine, she's wanted one herself.
I've recently been the beneficiary of a little "wage inflation", so
the finance part is in place - now we're just waiting for our oldest
daughter to find a place of her own and free up a spot in the garage.

My wife (Dorothea by name, same as Ferry Porsche's wife!), is most
interested in a '86 5-sp, but I keep thinking about giving her my
car and getting a GT for myself...

Hey Phil - is there a family membership in the 928 owner's club?
