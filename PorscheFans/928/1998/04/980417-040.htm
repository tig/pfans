According to my info and hazy brain:

The 928S was not offered for sale in the US for MY 1981 or 1982
due to concerns about emissions.

Euro 928S cars had the higher compression engine and a lot more
horsepower.

The 1983 and 1984 928S sold in the USA had the 4.7L engine.

The Euro 1983 & 1984 928S with 4.7L engine had twin distributors,
higher compression and lots of horses.

What confuses the issue is the so-called Competition Package which
was offered as a factory option in 1981 and 1982.  It included the S
spoilers front and rear, Bilstein gas-filled shocks, and Recaro Sport
Seats.  However, the story was that since the better performing
S engine couldn't be included for emissions reasons, it was not called
an S nor was the 928S logo attached.  My 1982 has the factory
Competition Package, looks like an S, but isn't an S so I just call it
an "S-look".  Wish it had the S engine though.......
