owner still owes $15,500 and does not want to take less. I upped our
offer to $12,500 and left it there, and went home...(snip)...  What do
you folks think? Wait him out? Go higher? Is it even worth a higher
price? I can do the known and unknown fix-up work myself with no
problem, but feel that I should get a good price break for it. We
already have a nice 86.5 with no problems so don't need another, but an
S4 stick would be nice and probably retain value better.>>

Louis et. al,
I would turn right back around and give the guy at least what he owes. 
Any dealer would be ignorant to not buy the car for $13,500.  87 928's
in very poor condition go for $14K at the auction.  The exotic car
dealers you spoke with may have said they would give $12K for the car,
but I guarantee they would advertise it "as-is" for $16,500.  Have the
car taken in for an inspection and if everything checks out OK buy it! 
The lack of service records is not necessarilly a sign of a bad car,
just a disorganized owner.  $15,500 would be an excellent deal on the
car, providing everything works and the inspection is good.  With 90K on
the clock you may have to recharge the a/c or replace a seat switch, but
it isn't a new car.  That minor stuff is to be expected.  Of course all
this is just my opinion.  That and a quarter will get you a cup of
coffee.  Let us know what happens!
