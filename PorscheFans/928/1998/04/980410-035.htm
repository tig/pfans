Hello Folks:

I am still searching for a car.  I have a question, how do I get a copy or
subscription to the Porsche Market Newsletter?  The loan has come thru and the
money is burning a hole in my pocket.  I hope it isn't too long from now.
Thanks for the replies I received earlier in the week, every bit helps.  BTW,
I will be in Hershey on the 25th, come over and say hello, I'll be the guy in
the wheelchair. (this method of spotting works almost every time, unless your
at the wheelchair national games)  Actually, I'll be with a friend who is also
in a chair.  Looking forward to meeting some of you.  See ya.

Scott Brown
1 wife 
but the rest of my life seems strangely empty (no 928)
