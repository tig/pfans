I know on the 84s that the silver are the best plugs WR8 or 7 DS (very
expensive retail) and the platimum plugs are very cheap
because there is very little plat. on them.  (big gimmik) =

Not familuar with the S4 plugs , however, I have changed them before.  ve=

easy, easier than the 84 S2.

nissan/mistubishi 300 or3000 .  Anyway,
I raced one last weekend at Thunderhill and i have 2 laps of video showin=
g
him handling me pretty well.  (really, only on the long straights)   Didn=

get a chance to see if he was modified as he was definatley on race rubbe=
r
like me.
(at least I was louder though)  He was noticeably faster.  Anyone know of=

the specs of the 3000 twin turbo.?
I ran pretty well beating much of the pro 7 field and some prosedan class=

 My times would have put me in the middle rear  of the pack for the
prosedan group.   (fastest was 2:08 and mid range was 2:15 to 2:20)  I wa=
