Since it's Easter it's kinda funny to have a 928 hunt!?!

With the 928 list still in the dumps ID-wise I am hoping
webpage visitors will be include the car owners or their
friends who can help me out. 

Whew, still more to go but wasn't expecting to spend all
afternoon on the computer.  Me thinks I should get out of
the house for a bit first.  Just added Richard Jaffe to Vol.
2...  Still have a bunch of photos from Brian and Elliot
and... etc.

I want my new coils!
