Hi Rich,
I recently removed the mirror on my 83s, which might not be the same
procedure to fix as yours but here goes.  The mirror was shaky while
driving so to remove it I turned the mirror and you will need the correct
size allen wrench to remove the bolt that holds the base of the mirror to
the door.  Then  slide the base down away from the mirror and you will see
where the power mirror wires enter into the mirror itself that there is a
type of large torx(looks like torx to me) nut that the wire travels right
through the center of.  I did not have the right size or type of torx
fitting to fit around the wire to tighten this.  Also to make the job more
difficult is that there is a very thick strong spring up in there to keep
things tight.  Mine had come completely unscrewed and I could not push it
far enough in to start the threads to come together because of the strong
spring.  I probably just don't have the right tool.  But for a temporary
fix until it goes to the garage for regular maintenance I removed one of
the spacers next to the spring which then allowed me to push the torx type
nut far enough up to start the threads, I then carefully used needle nose
pliers to tighten the nut.  (had a friend to help hold mirror steady)  You
don't want to mess up that paint with a slip! I didn't want to and didn't
know anything about mirror removal to see about removing the wire
temporarily to get it out of the way, but this would surely help the
problem.  
I hope this helps a little or at least lets you know what to expect if it
applies to your year of car.  (Make sure you save the spacer if you do
remove it so that a shop can fix it correctly with the appropriate tools
later)
