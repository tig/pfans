Hi Jason,

I had/have this same problem including the open window scenario. I was told
that it was caused by a loose fit at the air cleaner box. I have tried
repositioning and tightening as well as putting a dowel under/through the
rubber straps that hold the lid to tighten. It is intermittently fixed. I
would love to hear if you had any luck.
