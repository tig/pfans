>So the Euro is 300 hp due to cams and LJ tronic . 

Also due to larger displacement, larger intake runners, larger ports, 
larger valves. As far as total output power is concerned, CIS 
(K-Jetronic) can do 96-97% as good of a job as LH-Jetronic.

>I dont think the s4 manifolds would help that much, but I wonder about not 
having the cat and
>the belts and pumps on the motor.

From my experiences, eliminating the cat and installing a much more 
free-flowing exhaust will make a big difference.

>are all of the little air lines littering the engine just driven by the
>intake manifold????

Mostly.  Some don't go directly to the intake, some are "progressive," in 
that they don't get the engine vacuum signal until the throttle is open a 
certain amount.

>How much hp does the air pump take to drive?

Negligible.  About 1-3 hp the top end.

>Can you remove the fan pulley and sqeeze more hp out of the system?

Yes.  I gained about 7-10hp at the top by retrofitting electrics.

>Why is the 928 battery so big??? why cant you use a smaller half size die=
>hard to save 50 lbs???

I use a much smaller Volkswagon Diesel battery.  Saves 40lbs.

>Is there any drawback to using a smaller battery??????

Less reserve capacity for running accessories long periods with engine 
off.  Less "heavy" engine cranking time.  Unless your car has some 
ridiulous starting problems, it would never be an issue.  (A combination 
of all of the above plus extremely cold weather may cause a problem--I 
live in Texas, and have had no problems in years in several 928s.)
