Hello everyone!

	I have not sent in any email in a while!!! well anyways, i am still 
trying to find me a 928S4 that i can afford to buy without asking my parents for 
money anyways, i have found one, but i am wondering if it is worth it:
	
1987 928S4
black/black, 200,000 miles
2 owners with full maintenance records
engine rebuild at 160K or 140K miles because the first owner's daughter got some 
water into the engine!!, and the insurance had it completely rebuilt at the 
local Porsche dealership (some 9000$ job apparently). 

The owner is saying the car is in an excellent condition, but i don't know about 
how good it could be at 200k with an engine rebuilt and all.....

I need advice about how much the car could be really worth if it is in an 
excellent condition as the owner says, and the things i should look out for if i 
decide to go ahead and buy it, and any other valuable adive i can get.

Khaled
