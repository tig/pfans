Dear Porsche Fans:

I have a Porsche 928 82 with 102,000 miles and I recently took it to the
shop to diagnose a sound that was coming from behind the timing belt
area.  In the morning it sounds like a grinding sound in the engine with
an occasional high pitched squeel, the mechanic definately said it
sounded like a worn bearing or pulley, but I am unsure whether it could
be a water pump about to go or something more serious.

Has anyone ever heard this noise and how was it related.  Again it
sounds like there is something grinding with an occasional screech...I
am trying to determine what to expect from the mechanic and how much it
should cost to fix???  Anyone have a clue??

Mark
