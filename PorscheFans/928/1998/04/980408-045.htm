Hi all

My wife & I looked at an '88 S4 5 spd., with 90 K miles this afternoon. No
maintenance records past about a year ago when the present owner bought the
car in the central California area. We made an offer that was rejected. Here
is what the car was like.

1. Color was Venetian blue metalic; sort of dark gunmetal blue/gray metalic.
Paint condition was good. No scratches, but a few small rock chips on the
front. The interior was dark blue vinyl. Seemed like a lot of blue. Small
cracks between the individual defrost outlets. No other cracks on the dash or
pod. The climate control air vent plastic was broken. It has a new Sony
CD/radio which was not connected. The original Blaupunkt had failed - owner
still had it. One of the seat switches on the passenger seat was missing. The
drivers seat lumbar support didn't work; a lot of grinding noises, but
seemingly no lumbar support action. All other interior devices worked; HVAC
(front & rear), mirrors, sun roof, and the other seat controls. I didn't try
the seat heaters or the seat memory function. Leather seats in good condition;
slight wear on drivers seat bolster. The leather was soft and had no cracks.
There are some stains on the rear carpet. All tools are there as is a (non-
OEM) air pump.

2. Body condition was good with 1 parking lot ding on the left rear quarter
panel about the size of a quarter. Front & rear spoiler and attachments good.
The windshield had 2 small starred rock chips about 3/8 " in diameter. The
windshield has the embedded radio antenna.

3. Clutch worked (engaged) smoothly, and engaged at about 1/2 to 3/4 pedal
travel. No noise from the torque tube. Transmission quiet and synchros worked
fine. No discernable noise from wheel bearings or anything else but the tires
(Dunlops). The car does not have LSD.

4. The engine temp stayed in the 1/4 to 1/2 of scale range. The oil pressure
seemed a little on the low side. About 2 1/2 bar at idle and 4.5 bar when
above 1600 rpm. It never went any higher. The oil was pretty dirty and needed
changing. The owner said the car had been thoroughly checked a few months ago
with instructiions to replace anything that was needed. The water pump was
replaced at that time, but not the timing belt. Owner didn't know why the
timing belt was not replaced, only that the shop thought it was not necessary.
The front oil seal did not appear to be leaking. There was some oil wetness at
about midpoint on the engine where the front anti-roll bar crosses. I don't
think the oil was coming from the rear seal, but was in front of it. Maybe the
oil pan seal.

5. The brake pads look nearly new as do the front rotors. The rear rotors show
some wear. Brakes function normally with no indication of warped rotors. ABS
works.

6. The car drives  & handles fine. The shocks seem good (sport shock option).
The suspension seems a little stiffer than the '86.5 S we have now. The Dunlop
tires have about 75% tread. They are 225x50x16 on front & rear rather than the
245x45x16 that the rear should have. Wheels are natural polished (anodized not
chromed).

7. The engine pulls strong with no surges or dips in the torque. I took it to
rev limiter cut off at about 6400 and thereafter to 6200.

The owner is leaving for Europe on Monday 4/12 and has to sell it. He has had
several people look at it but no offers as of 4/8.

I checked with a couple exotic car dealers in the area and was told they would
give about 12K for the car since it had the standard trans. The Kelley Blue
Book trade in value in this area for this car in 'good' condition is $9950.
The KBB value for this car in 'excellent' condition is $10,700. I got those
numbers from www.kbb.com. I would consider this car to be in good, not
excellent, condition. The KBB retail price is $19,000. That of course is from
a reputable dealer, car with warranty, and thoroughly checked over with
financing available. This is not that situation.

We offered $11,500. The said that he had talked on the phone with a dealer who
would give him $13,500. The dealer has not seen the car. The owner still owes
$15,500 and does not want to take less. I upped our offer to $12,500 and left
it there, and went home. On the drive back I wondered if I had done the right
thing. Maybe we should have gone up a bit, or maybe not. The owner is in a
definite bind with only 2 business days left until he has to leave, and he may
or may not be able to get the $13.5 K from the dealer.

What do you folks think? Wait him out? Go higher? Is it even worth a higher
price? I can do the known and unknown fix-up work myself with no problem, but
feel that I should get a good price break for it. We already have a nice 86.5
with no problems so don't need another, but an S4 stick would be nice and
probably retain value better.

Sorry for the long post. I'm kind of exited about this.
