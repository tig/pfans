<<My cruise control on my 1987 S4 will not engage. Could this be a vacuum
problem or should I look elsewhere for the answer? >>

It could be either a vacuum or an electrical problem...or both!

The shop manual has a detailed procedure to test & trouble shoot the
"Tempostat" ( The name used in the book!!)

First check fuse #7...the same as the stop lights (I love that little green
LED fuse tester!)

One other simple thing to do next  is to keep your Cruise control lever pushed
forward while driving the car:, if it engages and "picks up" the gas pedal,
your vacuum works...Which you may be able to confirm anyways if your heating
system works normally too. (hear the PSSSS..sound when you change the vents'
setting) 
If it "releases" after that you can suspect an electrical problem (usually
with the switch on the steering column...)

Then the next easiest thing to do is check the control unit (you need an
ohmeter). You really need the manual for that! ( E-mail me privately if you
want, I may be able to give you a snip of what it says!)

You could still have a problem with a "stuck" actuator cable though. 

The servo is in the back of the left front wheel well. One opened, it is
realtively easy to take the servo out, undo the cable and check if it is
working  smoothly.

When you reassemble the cable amke sure that THERE IS NO tension on it (1 to 2
mm play is right) otherwise you may upset the setting of you throttle valve!

Good hunting.
