After two months of ownership and investing in 3K of repairs, have come
upon something new. The car has developed a mechanical ticking sound
when cold.  This continues until fully warmed up. The sound then
disappears but can still be heard faintly at idle.  The best way I can
describe it is similar to a wire being run against a spoke.  I crawled
under the car and check for loose items and could not find anything.  I
also pulled all wheels and checked for items that did no appear normal.
All seems in order.  I suspicion a catalytic converter issue.  The
muffler, headers, and exhausts all have proper hangers and attachments.
Also, the car when first started (cold) idles roughly for the first
three to five minutes and then smooths out after warm up.  When warmed
up it idlys very smoothly and there is no problems seen.  Cold start
valve problems or?  Any insights would be appreciated.
