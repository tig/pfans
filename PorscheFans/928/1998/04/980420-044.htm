I may have made a helpful discovery for those of us with vacuum
problems. The vacuum source for the HVAC and cruise control is a small
line coming off the brake booster fitting. While checking out my
problems in this area, I removed the check valve (small blue & white
drum on my '86S) and tested it. While it functioned as a check valve, I
noticed that I could not pull much air through the valve - it was acting
as a pretty severe restriction.  I sprayed carb cleaner in the valve
(risking damage to the rubber) and promptly blew it clear with
compressed air. After three cleanings, the valve operated much more
freely, and more importantly, passed a much greater volume of air. Since
I also had a loose fit where the hard plastic lines entered the rubber
cross fitting, I had a combination of low flow and some leakage.
Repairing both of these conditions allowed the heater valve to function
much more quickly and positively. I haven't tried the cruise control
yet, but I really expect improvement there also.
