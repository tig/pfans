David , Thanks for the post.  That was the information I was looking for.=

I understand about mush in a suspension as I was totally happy running =

my 928 for over 110k miles over the snakiest hyways in the US. until   on=
e
day at =

a race track   Sears point, and i was sold to never be stock in a
performance car again.
R1s, eibachs, 17s, some engine work to make a suto S4  out of my 84 , and=
 I
was now having =

some fun with all the yahoos at the track.  (passing full race sedans wit=
h
my a/c on and the days of =

thunder theme,  blasting through my helmet.  ( im a little more serious
now)
anyway,  does the grip of the rear tire make the toe in or the geometry o=
f
the suspension?
I though is was the geometry of the rear end that makes the wheel toe in =
as
the rear lifts up on braking.
since most of the forces on a cornering and braking car is lateral, Its
hard for me to see how the rears can
have any forces to make it toe in , regardless of the gip and gs  the rea=
rs
are working against.
Hey, Mark A and Lucky will know best.  and by the  tone of your response =
,
it sounds like you have done your homework.
You can understand my question though?

#2  Here is your quote from your last response: =

=2E.>>>>>>>  road puts much more stress on the toe in/out action and
exaggerates it immensely. Add to that the extra weight of the larger tire=
s
and it multiplies it even more.
Punch those 2 factors in to your "trig math" and you will find a differen=
t
outcome.>>>>>>>>>>>>  =

So, I think you agree that larger tire weight has nothing to do with it.

#3   Headers on a S4 is probably a gainer but I would agree again with yo=
u
here.  Not really worth it for 20 ft lbs.  Maybe??
Devek has tested a stock s4 and a header modified s4 and I saw the dyno
comparison at the shop.   Not the %gains that I saw with =

the 2 valve, but a good size gain, none the less  (around 20 foot lbs or
7-8%)

Thanks for your response , very informative and probably correct.   I jus=
t
want to know the truth.   (what about the 2 revolutionspin up
of the drive shaft.   something fishy there!!
talk to you later,
Mark K
84  928s  for the track now.
