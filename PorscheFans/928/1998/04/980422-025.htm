I was reading Barry's post on plug gaps et al and noticed he was 
expecting some comments. Not one to disappoint I'll indulge myself in a 
pet interest of mine. The mechanism involved in generating what would 
seem to be something as simple as a spark could, in fact does, fill 
books. It take a bunch of volts to fire the plug (5 to 20+ thousand 
depending on a whole lot of things) but as soon as the spark is initiated 
and current starts flowing (a spark has a low impedance) and the voltage 
drops to about a thousand volts or so (again the actual value depends on 
lots of things). This thousand or so volts is what is referred to as the 
burn voltage or spark line and is what actually ignites the fuel. So we 
end up with a high voltage for a very short time and a lower burn voltage 
for much longer, of course longer is just a few milli seconds. Opening 
the plug gap will certainly increase the spark voltage and potentially 
over stress the coil insulation if it goes above the design limit so I 
definitely agree with Barry on that one. Especially if you go hog wild 
and double the gap or something crazy like some after market CDI 
manufacturers suggest.  A few thou extra should be fine I would think. 
I'm not so sure I agree about the additional current flow of a smaller 
gap damaging the plug wires though. The amount of current flowing is 
small enough that even a substantial increase would not be a problem. So 
here's a deal for those of you interested in this kind of stuff who have 
access to a scope. I have a couple of capacitive secondary pickups that 
I'll give away. They're new but not the current model. These will let you 
look at the secondary voltage on a scope by just clamping on the plug 
wire. They're worth about a couple of hundred each in the US. I have no 
idea how many, if any, responses I'll get so I need to put some controls 
in place I guess. Tell me why you want one (simple curiosity and 
educational applications score well with me), tell me the make and model 
of the scope (because they're useless without one) and promise faithfully 
that you won't sell it, swap it for something else or use it to make 
money but will pass it along under the same conditions if and when you 
don't need it any more. As my contribution to continuing education I'll 
pop for the postage but I'll be sending them from Toronto so any 
applicable duty etc is up to you.
