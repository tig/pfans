Rob,
	I had this problem on my car.  I believe it is referring to
Brake Pressure.  There is a switch located on the master cylinder
that I had to replace.  I disconnected the wire to the switch until
I had a chance to replace the switch.  I think the switch cost me about
$40 from Porsche.  To clear the annoying flashing !, disconnect the negative
side of the battery for a few seconds.
