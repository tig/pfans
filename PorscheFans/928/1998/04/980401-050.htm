If this is the second time I've answered just ignore me. Our email sever 
seems to have something against me just lately. Anyway, I wouldn't 
recommend 21 watt lamps in place of the 10 Watt that should be there. The 
lens for that one lamp is a multi layer thing that comes real close to 
the bulb. It might well melt a little. When I got my car it had 1156 
lamps (28 Watt?) in each hole and the inner part of the lens was showing 
the effects. In my case they were cracked as well so new ones were part 
of the deal. If you can't find 10 Watt bulbs for some reason the #93 
seems to be readily available. I measured them at 12 Watts and its what I 
used with no problems.
