For Sale in Bakersfield, Ca: 1985 At, Blk/Tan, 112K, $9595; the dealer said
that the timing belt and waterpump were changed within the last 200 miles.
The interior is reflective of the car's age, and the exterior paint is
original.  Or, there's my car, a 1982 AT, Weinrot Metallic/Blk, 119K.  The
interior has been redone and looks great,  the exterior was repainted by
the PO.  My car is in much better shape than the dealer's 85, but it has
the 32V motor and 4sp AT tranny.  Feel free to send direct email with
questions, or call 805 872 2887.

Questions: How do I check the vent system of the fuel tank?  I've got the
loud whirring form the rear of the car also.  How car I get more bang for
my buck?  The car gets 12mpg around town and it seems that for this uel
consumption, I could get more HP, or for the same HP I could get better
fuel efficiency.  I know that the earlier cars are not as efficient as the
newer ones.  Can that be changed in any way?

Thanks,

Ravi Singh

PS: Eddie Plantillas, if you're out there, did you try my formula for your
door locks and did it work?
