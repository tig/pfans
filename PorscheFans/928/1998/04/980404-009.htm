 Yes, something VERY similar happened to me.  I had just finished 
completing my racing engine (based on '85 Euro) and had installed it in 
the car.  On the maiden voyage out (Sat. night) I saw someone madly 
flashing their lights at me from behind.  I looked back and saw a thick, 
white smoke-trail from MY car(!).  I quickly pulled off the road into a 
Dunkin' Donuts parking lot, popped the hood, jumped out saw plumes off 
smoke emanating from the front of the engine. 8^0
 After towing it back, and inspecting it, this is what happened:  When I 
was putting everything back on the crank (cam belt pulley guide, 
timing-belt pulley, harmonic balancer,etc) I forgot ONE thing:  there are 
two slightly curved steel "timing-belt guides" that go on both sides of 
the timing-belt sprocket; I had forgotten to put the *outer* one on.  So 
the upshot is that within 5-10 minutes of running, the timing belt had 
moved forward, stopped only by PLASTIC timing belt cover.  Friction makes 
heat.  Heat makes plastic melt.  More heat starts small fire. The belt 
was almost completely disintegrated.  The belt is normally about an inch 
wide--what was left on mine was about 1/3 of an inch! I was very lucky.  
The rest was just threads everywhere inside the covers. Anyway, it was a 
HUGE, smelly mess to clean up.  The engine stunk for 2 weeks after it was 
all repaired.
