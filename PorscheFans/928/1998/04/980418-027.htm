I use "recycled concrete driveway molds".  :-)

No, really! A friend had a new driveway poured and had troubles with 
the contractor so he had to clean up himself. 2"x10" boards were used 
in most places. I cut (4) at about 36" long, and (4) more at 24" all 
with a 45 degree bevel. Nailed the 24" on top of a 36" after knocking 
the larger chunks of concrete off. And the result is 4 ramps that are 
just right for basic things such as oil changes. You could go 3 boards 
high if 3-1/2" isn't high enough for you.

Naturally you want to raise all 4 wheels at the same time else your oil
dipstick will lose calibration. ;-)

I have metal ramps that I've found the wooden ramps can be used as a
pre-ramp to prevent the 928 from scraping its nose. I put the drive-up
end of the metal ramp on top of a wooden one, leaving the far side of
the metal ramp on the concrete driveway. Think about it and you'll
realize how the wooden ramp lessens the slope on the metal ramp. It also
lessens the slope of the final bump stop. And you'll realize I'm asking
for trouble in more ways than one by stacking ramps.

When not used to raise the car, they're good as garage curbs. Bump your 
front tire against one and you know you are in.
