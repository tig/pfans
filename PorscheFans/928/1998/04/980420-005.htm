Cruising Music to consider:  Don't Look Back & Cool Your Engine (Good
Tune, Bad Title) by Boston.  Actually what ever gets your yaya's is
fine.

To the member with the side ways acceleration after a recent rebuild
(Lucky Devil), FWIW;  If you have a lack of straight line acceleration
Mother nature may be telling you it is time to realign your suspension.
You did not mention whether your car has a limited slip differential or
not.  Also power shifting over a crest or bump in the road can cause a
sideways movement in the suspension.

Looks like the IRS levied a fee by taking the 4/15 posting..........

Is it my imagination or is it true that now that the weather in the NE
is fine, I am seeing more Tiajuna taxi's cruising around for the likes
of me?  Had tow pace me on Saturday will I aired out the shark that
afternoon.

Phil,  saw the new photo's and they are great!!!!!!  But I'm concerned
about you peddling a ladies pictures around the world......Hope the
shark is better soon.
