Very interesting read Barry!

Am looking at the owners manual again for baseline
figures...

Bosch WR 7 DC, WR 7 DP
gap 0.028+0.004 in / 0.70+0.1mm

The plugs came pre-gapped at 31 or 32 (memory fails me) and
it's an old practice of mine to open plugs up a hair for a
fatter spark.  I don't recall what the operating range was
on the plug box, will check again.  I hope I have some
leeway now with new coils...

Felt great that night though I don't recall feeling that tip
top rush that strong before but maybe I've forgotten in my
ever advancing age?  The feeling could've been amplified by
the tunnel, whose end I was reaching far too fast!  (Thus
confirmation ABS was still in effect!  Hoo hah big ole fast
car!)

Also I am recalling those dual resistors per coil, why did
Porsche choose to reduce voltage once the engine started
instead of leaving it hot all the time?  

I've heard from another list member who is successfully
running Magnecor 8.5's on his 32-valver, what wires are you
running?  I don't know how old my wires are but "they meter
out within specs" so I might want to R&R sometime heh heh...

Thanks again for the reply,
Phil

Gory details wanted!
