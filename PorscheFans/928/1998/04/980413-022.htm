 I'm not sure if this applies, but I 'll relate one odd experience:  A 
couple of years ago I was leisurely cruising along at about 85mph when 
the 928 just *quit*--as though the coil wire had been pulled off.  After 
several minutes of simple road-side tests, I discovered that the 
fuel-pump fuse had blown.  So, I replaced it with a spare.  It blew.  
Then I temporarily put a large paper clip in place of the fuse to 
possibly "clear out" the short.  It just melted the paper clip.  I had a 
cheezy toolset in the car, so I removed the cover over the 
fuel-pump/filter.  What I found was that even though the car was a US 
'82, Porsche used the same wiring harness for all countries, including 
Japan, where those cars had TWO fuel pumps.  It turned out the unused 
extra wire for that non-existent pump had shorted out.  Easy fix--I just 
cut it out.
