I know it's kinda late on this thread, but I've been travelling alot.
Coincidentally, I took my driver door apart this past weekend for the
same reason - nuisance rattle- and needed to install new outer window
weatherstrip.   The rattle (on mine) is coming from the point where the
guide post (which the nylon slider rides up and down) fits into the
welded post on the bottom of the door.   I can feel maybe a quarter inch
gap and can wiggle the guide back and forth enough to duplicate the
irritating rattle.   I tried several things to fix in place, but didn't
manage.   I'm guessing there is supposed to be an insulator of some sort
down there that is now missing.   When the window is all the way up, or
all the way down, all is well.  I reluctantly buttoned it back up
deciding to tolerate the rattle - but will likely keep the window either
all the way up or down.   I'm just suggesting that the rattle may well
be due to that guide post wobbling around.
