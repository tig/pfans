Because the previous owner removed the cat
converter on my 81 928, and I have little reason
or capability to return to the original, I've decided
to chuck the air pump, filter cannister, oxygen
sensor, oxygen mileage counter, hoses, valve
(disseminator, diffusor, diddilator or whatever
that thing at the back is called) and so on.  If
anyone sees a big problem with this from the
point of view of performance (hah) or engine life,
please let me and others who might be doing it
know.  I don't think the manufacturer would like
it, but they probably didn't like putting all that
junk on in the first place.

PS - thanks to the responses to my hog snuffle
brake problem.  I discovered that in addition to
the basic problem (and interacting with it), the
right front brake was thin and rubbing, and the
PO's hard and bumpy "205 Daytona" tires had
actually loosened the balljoints.  I am getting the
brake repaired, and ordered some round tires just
for a change.  I hope 225/50ZR-16 Yokohama
AVS - S4 meet with the approval of list members.
I'm hoping my caring attitude will heal the ball
joints.  It worked during my two e-marriages.

PS2 - I am getting some of the list mail
scrambled.  It looked like someone actually called
an S4 "german d*ng" (can't even repeat it).  I
wonder what he calls his mother.  I'd be glad to
take it, even if it has more bugs than Windows
95.

PS3 - Music postings.  Do people really need
music to speed by in a 928?!?  (Besides, get
serious, that would have to be CCR, There's a
place up ahead and I'm goin' just as fast as my
feet can fly...).  Au contrairie as we say on the
prairie, I look for music to slow down by.  The
best so far is Scott McKenzie "Sa-a-n Fran-cis-co,
Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair".  It's
so
so
  -  oops flell assleep there

God I love California
