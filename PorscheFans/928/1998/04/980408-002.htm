Dean,

My wife spent her last birthday driving her Honda Accord (5-sp) 500+
miles following me home when I picked up my 928 - with our 3 year old
daughter in the car.  If she wants a 928 for herself, I'm not going to
deny her.

Right now she's trying to decide whether to get the car or use the money
to go back to school instead.  She figures if she did go back to school,
she'd still have my (our?) 928 to drive.

Bill
