 Anyone ever replace their windshield washer motor? 

Oh yea.  Remove your air filter, passenger side air intake tube, drain
a gallon of radiator fluid from radiator ( enough to empty reservoir
and hoses to it), remove reservoir.  Now you can just bairly get at
pump.  The pump is probably held in with rubber "nipples" that are
designed to install easily to hold the pump in place, but not to come
out easily.  the nipples will have to be forced out from the back if
you wish to re-use them.  I couldn't find any local supply for them so
my pump is now held in with tie raps. (Who gasped? I heard that). 

Anyway have a ball, try not to cut your hands to much, and look around
for the kids before you cuss out loud. The pump you bought for the
headlights should fit.  My pump had a tiny spec of sand in it, that
stopped it dead.  Works fine now.

Oh yea, wait till you try to put that second screw back in the
reservoir mount, now that is going to be fun!
