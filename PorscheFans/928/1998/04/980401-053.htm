Hello Gene. You are pretty fortunate to have driven a 456. I'm sure 
there are only a handful in this country, much less the world. I became 
intrigued by the 928 vs 456 comparison when I examined both of their 
dimensions. They are very close, the biggest difference being weight and 
width (road testers would say the 928 was quite wide, what do they say 
about the 456!?). You obviously live around a metropolitan area where 
exotic cars abound. I'm 80 miles north of Grand Rapids, Michigan -- the 
nearest town is the largest in the county, population 2300!  The entire 
county is less than 10,000.  So it is a rare occasion that I see another 
928. Back in '77 my dad wanted to get a 450SL Benz, I tried to convince 
him to consider the new 928, but he had his mind made up. He now has a 
500SL and Viper (and a 3000 mile Delorean that's for sale). A few years 
ago when I became financially capable of getting a 928, I started 
looking and found a nice '85 automatic. What an incredibly neat car -- 
so capable of startling high speeds and handling, yet docile and 
practical around town (and SO good looking!). It's no wonder that all of 
the magazine road testers had hard-ons just thinking about the 928 -- 
IT'S THE GREATEST CAR EVER MADE!!
