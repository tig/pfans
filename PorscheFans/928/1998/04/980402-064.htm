Khaled:

You just gotta' ask yourself is that particular car the one
you will keep for a long time?  You are hesitating already
and I think it's a good thing.  Remember the advice to get
the newest, best condition in your price range - though that
S4 claims to have been rebuilt (documented?  serviced by?)
etc. give your search some more time.  The mileage isn't
really a big deal, slightly high for the year, definately
high considering the market of low mileage examples, but
that depends alot on how it was treated to get there, which
will set the pace for the stuff you will need to do on a go
forward (and hopefully backward too) basis.  Kind of a
double edge sword - the car obviously must have been running
great to rack up those miles, but now it's time to care for
it too.

It's one thing to go with a gut feeling on a cheaper car,
another thing when it comes to the 928 and I'd like to see
you a happy owner.

What is the asking price on that S4 anyhows, I am curious
(heh heh)
