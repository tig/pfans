	Hi Rich,
	I recently removed the mirror on my 83s, which might not be the same
	procedure to fix as yours but here goes.  The mirror was shaky while
	driving so to remove it I turned the mirror and you will need the correct
	size allen wrench to remove the bolt that holds the base of the mirror to
	the door.  Then  slide the base down away from the mirror and you will see
	where the power mirror wires enter into the mirror itself that there is a
	type of large torx(looks like torx to me) nut that the wire travels right
	through the center of.

	You need a 12mm serrated bit.  I got mine from Southern Auto.  Cost about $8.
