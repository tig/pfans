As a result of a headlight problem, I removed the headlight bulbs and
discovered that the #3 brown wire was chared and not making a proper
connection.  I was able to complete the connection but I still have the chared
problem.  I am using 100/80 watt Solite bulbs.  What is the brown wire and why
would it be chared?  

There are 3 wires that connect to the bulb.
#1, labeled 56A, White with black stripe
#2, labeled 56B, Yellow with black stripe
#3, labeled 31, brown

Should I replace the connector or will it be alright as is?  Thanks for your
help.

Note: I took a 3 hour ride to the beach this weekend in the Shark and it was
the most enjoyable part of the weekend even though the weather was great.  I
could not wait until I could drive home.  I have the illness.
