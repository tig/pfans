Hello all,

I am the guy that had the humming/vibrating noise coming from the fuel pump
area of my 83 auto.  The noise only occurs sometimes at idle or at very
light throttle.  The noise does not happen quite as often it seems now
though. I have replaced the fuel filter with a new one hoping that would
solve the problem but that hasn't done the trick.  I'll get it sooner or
later.  My friend changed the filter in about what seemed to be ten
minutes.  I was still nursing a hangover so I didn't even make it out there
in time to see!

I also have the window rattle problem on both windows.  I read a post that
says it is a real hassle to fix.  I just try not to shut the doors with the
windows down part way.

HEY PHIL,  I haven't gotten word to Tom Shwenk yet since he has not been to
the shop again.  MY buddy that works there took his car out for a test
drive after he fixed his shifter.  He said the car seemed very docile just
like the other older ones that he had driven.........Until he gave it a
little more gas.   He then told me that it felt like it was probably one of
the most powerful cars that he has driven since working there.(Or ridden
in)
