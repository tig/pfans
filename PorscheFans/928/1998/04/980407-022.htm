Good for you (I don't like airbags). They were standard on US 928s starting
with model year 1990.

No, something right. The molds for those taillight lenses were made in
1986, the calendar year the S4 went into production (for model year 1987),
and were not changed thereafter. You're used to cars which get restyled
every year or so, resulting in new optics and trim and making life harder
for parts suppliers and customers.

>I'm going to get the VIN and take a closer look

Good. While you're looking at the car, check the build sticker in the trunk
and get all the option codes (full instructions on Phil Tong's Web site at
http://www.928s4vr.com and look for the "Option Codes" page) to learn lots
more about the car and its equipment.
