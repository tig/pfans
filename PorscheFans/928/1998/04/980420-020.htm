JP et al:
Instead of buying new seats consider getting some premium sheepskin covers. 
The seats in my car are still perfect but the sheepskins really add to the
overall plushness of the interior and are cool in the summer and warm in the
winter.  The $450.00 I spent on covers by Superlamb in San Diego (619)
566-2031 (they may have other national outlets) was well worth it.  The
covers are custom made for the seats and are available in a variety of
colours.  Don't go for some cheaper version if you want a true custom fit. 
The pile (thickness) of many other brands is often inferior also.

Gene:  I think they even have sheepskins in denim - HA!!
