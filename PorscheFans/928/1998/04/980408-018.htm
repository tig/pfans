I think the correct expression is... umm... "Yeehaa!!!"

Andy drove away in the SE at 7am two days ago.  Yesterday at 2:00pm
I bought a 1987 S4 5spd.  It's midnight blue with cream leather and
it's VERY pretty.  I made it prettier, drove it straight to the tyre
place and put 17" GTS style rims on it.

There hasn't been a decent 5 spd for sale in months and I ended up
with TWO to choose from.  I must have been REALLY good in a previous
life!

Work starts now.  Driving these "standard" S4s makes me realise just
how special the SE is.  (Lucky Andy!)  The mid range and top end 
grunt which made the SE sparkle just isn't there.  Not that I am
criticizing the S4, it goes like a cut cat!  It's just going to go
better as I start spending the next few months income on modifications.

Aren't these cars just great!!
