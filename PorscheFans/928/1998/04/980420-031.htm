     I recently purchased a muffler bypass system for my 91 GT from David 
     Roberts. I ordered the version with polished stainless steel pipes. 
     Installation took about 30 minutes which was truely bolt-on. It looks 
     GREAT with twin 3-inch polished slanted tips! 
     
     The exhaust note is now truely EXOTIC! The sound is difficult to 
     describe which is definitely louder, but not offensive. This is 
     obviously a subjective measurement. The pitch is similiar to a 360 
     degree V8 header system since the pipes exit side by side. The sound 
     is now much more representative of the 326 HP under the hood.
     
     I have to admit that I was enticed by reading Phil's stories about his 
     new exhuast sounds. Now I turn down the stereo and roll down the 
     windows to get the full extent of the "Motor Music". I also find 
     myself revving higher RPM's in each gear to play more through the 
     range of notes. Thanks David and Phil.
