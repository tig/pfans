Hi Glenn, I saw your post about Warren Motorsports who rebuilds fuel
injectors and was unable to find their website.  Could you e mail me and
tell me what it is?  eric.hoffman@hboc.com  I wish I'd known about them
when I drove Nissan Z cars, which are famous for $100 each leaky
injectors that cause those cars to catch on fire.  Nissan recently had a
factory recall on 84-88 or so 300 ZX's for free injector replacement. 
Which fortunately helped me none because I had an 83 280ZX.  I have
heard they are made for Nissan by Bosche, does anyone know if that's
true?

Just a FYI for everybody, when looking for something on the web, click
on www.dogpile.com (no kidding), this is a search engine that
individually goes through every search engine!
