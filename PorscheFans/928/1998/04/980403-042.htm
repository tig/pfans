Hello fellow shark fans,

Bad news to report. Last night some dumb f**k decided to ram his Mercury
Mystique into the ass end of my 928 - he hit me with enough force to spin
the car 180 degrees! Needless to say, the bumper cover is toast, and both
rear quarter panels are buckled and flared more than a 930. The passenger
door is jammed shut, and the driver side door will not close after it was
forced open. Closer inspection in daylight revealed some buckling in the
roof as well as under the driver side door sill. The spare tire compartment
and battery area are buckled upward too. I jacked the car up and looked
underneath, but could'nt really tell if anything was bent although the left
muffler (or cat?) seems to hang lower than the right. The car is
undriveable due to sheet metal jammed against the rear tires although I
guess a good pry bar might remedy this. The automatic shift lever now
requires significantly more effort to move.

Any ideas about cost of repair? Should it be totalled? Any sources for fair
valuation as I expect the insurance company adjuster to be clueless as to
928s and will give some rediculous low ball offer. TIA for any
ideas/suggestions.
