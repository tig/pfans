Julian, perhaps the car you saw had damaged paint.  My 88 S4 is Granit
Green, the original paint, and it sparkles like a diamond.  Check it out at
Phil Tong's fantastic web site http://www.928s4vr.com/mikeclem.htm

To answer Biran Buxton's question; granite green is more of a pearecent gray
than green.  On cloudy days its appears gray.  In sunlight, green overtones
really accent the curves well.  And, it shines, does not appear oily and
dirty (unless of course it is).  My car also has linen interior.  

Regards,

Mike Clemens
88 928S4, Granit Green which sparkles.
86 Chevy wagon Black that is oily and dirty.
94 ZX-11 for when the Porsche isn't fast enough.
94 Cub Cadet 970  (you cant go fast all the time)  :)
