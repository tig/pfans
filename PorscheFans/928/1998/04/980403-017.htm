I have just added another chapter in my intermittant window saga.  
Mine was intermittant for quite some time, then just quite working.  
I didn't drive the car much over the winter.  Once I went to start it 
and the battery was dead (old anyway).  I put a new battery in and 
have driven it a few times since.  I noticed each time I drove it the 
voltage was a little high in 'cruise'.  

Yesterday I took the car out for a more extended drive (nice weather 
and I just waxed it :-)  The temperature was warmer than the 
previous drives and the voltage at highway speeds was more normal 
(maybe the battery is finally charged?).  Anyway, to make a long 
story longer, the window worked.  I took the car on several errands 
(sometimes letting it sit for over an hour) and the window worked 
every time.  Is this wierd or what!

Now this leads me to believe the problem is related to one of two 
things.  First possibility, the bad battery.  Second, low 
temperatures.  Incidentally, I've tried a number of things various 
list people suggested (contact cleaner etc.) to no avail.  I had 
given up until yesterday.  Any further insight???
