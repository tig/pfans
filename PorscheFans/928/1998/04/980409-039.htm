  I think FZICIST or someone equally qualified needs to step in here and set
  one of us straight.  (Probably me.)  I thought the laws of physics show
  that on a given car running with a given air pressure in the tires, the 
  size of the contact patch will not change just because larger tires are 
  installed.  If high profile narrow tires are installed with 36psi, the area 
  in the contact patch will be the same as the area in a contact patch 
  provided by a low profile wide tire also running 36psi.  The difference 
  will be that the high profile narrow tire provides a long narrow patch 
  while the low profile wide tire provides a short wide patch.
  
  The advantage of the wider tires is their ability to better tolerate 
  cornering loads by providing a much less distorted contact patch as the 
  tire begins to roll over during a turning maneuver. (i.e. percentage wise,
  less of the full width of a wide tire will tend to roll over than a narrow 
  one given similar conditions.)  During cornering, a tall skinny tire has a 
  contact patch that gets distorted to a such a long thin area that it keeps 
  a large amount of rubber in contact with the road (relative to the direction 
  of travel) for a longer period of time as the tire rotates, thereby 
  generating heat and ultimately reducing available traction.  Since the 
  contact patch of the wider tire is shorter, each rotation of the tire will 
  result in a smaller amount of rubber remaining in contact with the road 
  over a given period of time as the tire rotates.
  
  If we're going to say that the contact patch is larger just because the
  tires are wider, then that statement would need to be qualified by saying
  that the pressure being used in the wider tires is different than that
  being used in a narrower tire.
  
  What's the straight scoop?
