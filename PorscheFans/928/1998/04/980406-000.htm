	The timing belt tensioner floats on a pivot bolt/plastic bearings.  The 
bearings wear out, if the belt is replaced and not those bearing then 
sooner or later the tensioner will wobble.  The belt will ride at the 
front or rear edge of the tensioner roller, and the edge of the belt will 
rub against the tensioner bracket.  The same problem happened to me but 
no fire, smelled like a fire!  When the Timing belt is replaced leave 
nothing to chance,  3 new rollers ( one on the crank and 2 on the 
tensioner ), new water pump, new tensioner bearings, crank seal, and 
possibly crank gear ( mine got ruined taking it off to get at the seal ).

	Almost $300 for rollers, $50 for the belt, $150 pump, $25 tensioner 
bearings(later black plastic), $20 crank seal.

	Nobody said this would be cheap!  But remember if the job is done right, 
it will last for 60,000 miles, done wrong need new engine!

	Hope your engine is OK, sugest do a complete pump/belt job!	How many 
timing belts have been replaced without replacing those little plastic 
bearings?
