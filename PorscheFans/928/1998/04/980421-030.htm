Actually I think you will be safe in cutting it open and/or throwing it 
out with the garbage. Don't know when but I think PCB's were eliminated 
from common items such as spark plug coils quite a while back. And with 
Porsche, Inc's environmental bent, a 1990 928 should be PCB free. Then 
again, what do I know?  :-)

Really old "can" ignition coils have been filled with some kind of 
fluid. Motorcycle ignition coils that I can remember (1984 Honda 
VT500C) are almost certianly dry (unless its raining).

OTOH the pole pig is likely to be many years old. And even if it was new
the utility companies were making quite a stink about keeping their
PCB's and probably got the waiver. Can't say that I blame them as the
benefits of some things outweigh the cost of hazardous material
handling.

'83 928S
