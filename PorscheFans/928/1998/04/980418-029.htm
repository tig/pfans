This behaviour sounds like a cooling problem to me, not an oil pressure one.
Oil pressure at 2 bar won't make the engine get hot, it's the other way
around.

I'm not a mechanic, not even a hands-on amateur, but both of my 928s have
behaved about like that with the oil pressure.  When cold they sit between
4 and 5 bar, when hot they idle at around 2 bar and go up to between 4 and
5 when I'm on the motorway.  2 bar is about 28psi, which is plenty for an
engine at idle.  (My Peugeot, which admittedly is getting long in the tooth,
idles at less than 1 bar, and my Lotus Seven idles at less than 10 psi when
it's been working hard.)

If it's cooling down on the freeway, maybe they forgot to hook up your fans
again after the injector service?  Or there's some problem with the
thermostat?
