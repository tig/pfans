Barry

There is a transducer fitted to the differential that sends a signal to 
the speedo. Its a round, plastic thing that sits in a "well" in the rear 
of the housing. Mine fell out and was just hanging from the wire. Putting 
it back where it belonged fixed things for me. At least it did. My 
odometer quit on me yesterday but as the speedo is working I assume I 
have the plastic gear failure that seems so common. Did someone post info 
on buying just the gear? Where? The voltmeter quit last week also so it 
looks like I'm into pod removal in the very near future.

Philips Knoxville from you email address? Still making those big screen 
TV's down there?
