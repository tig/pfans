(snip)

I just had my AC system fixed and I was contemplating changing over to 
134a too.  The mechanic at the shop I went to advised me against it.  
(independent shop, specializing in Porsches, mechanic personally owns 
two 928s, I think he's pretty good/honest/fair).

Basically, he said:
1.  The 928 is already an "AC challenged" car.
2.  134a realistically has only about 80% of the cooling ability of R12.
3.  I don't have the rear AC unit between the seats to help out.

On the other hand, he said that 928 AC systems are notorious for 
leaking, and that I would probably have to add some refrigerant about 
once a year.  In the long run, 134a would be cheaper (but probably 
wouldn't cool as well).

Just what I was told, FWIW.

(Maybe it was just a ploy to sell me the $40/lb R-12...(?) )

I had a leaking expansion valve which was replaced, leaking schrader 
valves on the compressor which were sealed with caps, and a clutch that 
didn't work (he re-soldered the ground wire which was burned).  Added 
R-12, lubricating oil, a leak detecting dye (good idea), and a new 
receiver/dryer (which I supplied) and $687.00 later, it's working.

It does seem to take a while to cool down, but once there, maintains 
pretty well.  We haven't had any REAL hot days yet though...

I would ALSO like to hear about other people's AC systems.  Is the 928 
an AC challenged car?  There is a lot of glass there for the sun to bake 
through...

'83 928 S  -COOL (for now)
'74 914 2L  no AC, just take off the top! (Air-cooled in more ways than 
one).
