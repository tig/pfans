Dean - The coolant sensor is just a switch, with ground on one side
and the sensor wire on the other. Unfortunately I don't know 
whether the switch is closed or open when the coolant is low, but
a little work with an ohmmeter should tell you that. On an '84,
the sensor wire is blue-red, and goes from the sensor to P6 on the
relay panel to G6 on the relay panel to pin 14 on the Central 
Warning Unit, which is located next to the left side footwell.
The central Warning Unit provides the signal for the lights in
the dash. Your wiring is probably the same as the '84, but no
guarantees there. 

I suppose the easiest way to start would be to just unplug the
sensor and see if the light goes away. If not, ground both
wires, and again see if the light goes away. If not, start
tracking down that wire.
