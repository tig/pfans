Yes folks, it only took me 8 days to be pulled over by a high patrolman!
And believe it or not, it wasn't for speeding. Suspicion of a stolen
vehicle and no plates. The plates thing was my fault. I had the car
detailed and took the temp tag off so the back window could be cleaned.
I forgot to put it back on. But stealing a 928?? Come on, I had a kid's
carseat in the front! The patrolman kept me for over 20 minutes. No
record of a VIN, no record of the plates being registered to me. I kept
trying to tell him I had just registered the car the day before, but
still we just sat there. I have to say the car looked real nice sitting
there, all shiney and new looking. A little embarassed though.

I called the license bureau, it takes 2-5 days for anything to register.
I don't know why the patrolman didn't know this. This one is good, you
know what the patrolman said to me, and this was after I told him the
car had just been detailed..."an '87, this car looks too good to be an
'87, are you sure it's not newer??" Like it's really a '91 and I was
just told it was an '87! What exactly are the qualifications needed to
become a highway patrolman???

I was very polite and didn't not get a ticket. And in all fairness, he
was only concerned for me. It's unsafe to buy a car through the
internet, you know.

BTW, I bought my car through Brian Buxton. And NO IT'S NOT A STOLE
CAR!!! I would buy another car through Brian, too.
