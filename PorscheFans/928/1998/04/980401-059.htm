Just wanted to say a big and heartfelt THANKS to all the
great and numerous friends I've met here on the list!  
There were times when I didn't know what I would do without
you all, others when I couldn't stop laughing my a@@ off at
the more humorous posts and I look forward everyday for all
the new messages.

I post this today as Phil Tong, Sr. was born April 1, 1918. 
Two years ago today, we celebrated his 78th birthday in the
hospital not knowing he would not awaken the next morning. 
Dad hung in there a few weeks longer and succumbed later,
God rest his now free soul.  I was in a serious funk until
Madison helped pull me out of it.  Unexpectedly and
unfortunately, his father also did pass that year and I
helped pull him out too.  

I know for me, diverting much of my energy and fascination
to the 928 has helped me stay grounded, as well as take
flights of fancy.  Conversing with you all, and even better
getting to meet many of you in person is just wonderful!  I
have never met such nice people and will be lucky to have
you all as friends through life.

So now you know why this is all so very personal to me.  I
wish I was joking about the above but am not.  So...

Thanks again to the BEST FANS ON THE NET - 928 PORSCHEFANS!

Now, back to the day!  Have fun, be good to yourself, to
your landsharks  and to others!
Phil
