Brian,
Had to work today (Saturday) so I couldn't make the Air Show in Louisville. 
If I could've made it, I was going to call you......just as well though, as
it's raining and cold here today. Did you see there was someone else from the
Louisville area wanting to meet up too?.....can't remember the name
though.....
Just recently saw your 928 on Phil's site. Nice car!.....of course I knew it
would be, as you see so many 928's in your business, I figure you keep the
best for yourself..... :-)
I really like the steering wheel you have in it too......adds a nice
touch......Is that the Momo Club 3? You can get away with that because you
have a black interior, but it just wouldn't look right in mine.....oh
well....such is life.
I'm going to an autocross tommorrow down here, weather permitting. 
You going to autoX your 930? Did you get the wheel fixed? 
I saw you bought a set of Bridgestone RE 71's for your 928.
Just ordered a set from the Tire Rack for mine yesterday. They are an
EXCELLENT tire value. Was considering something a little newer tech, like the
Pilot SX MXX3 (much more $ per tire.....whew!) but hope to soon upgrade to 17"
(or maybe even 18"s) and will most likely shod them with the Pilots. We'll
see....Still haven't figured out exactly what wheel I want.....hard to beat
the look of a 928 with the C2 type wheels you have on yours, or the technology
wheels, but I want a wider wheel and some monster rubber......again, we'll
see. Currently still leaning toward the Forglines, but haven't seen them other
than in pictures........ 
I also saw where you're happy with the exhaust on your 928 and am also
thinking about a Bursch test pipe for mine, since it does allow the use of the
oxy-sensor, but I'm not quite ready for the muffler bypass......must admit,
I'm kinda curious to hear yours first before I commit. What exactly is your
exhaut setup? Bursch and bypass?
(didn't mean for this to turn into a thousand questions)
Just wanted to drop you a line while I finally had some free time. 
(also cc'd the list to kinda update them too)
We must get together soon........till then..........

Best Regards,
Greg S.
