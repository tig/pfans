probably depends on your financial means and/or how much you do yourself
compare
to having it fix (and how much you bargain for price...)

Did you ever drive one?  Not trying to be smart but it convinces a lot
of 
people.   How much did you put in your CRX supercar??  Can you drive it
daily and what is it worth if you try to sell it away?  Is it comparable
to what you get with the 928?

928 are very reliable and i have not heard of too many people that were
left
stranded (appears the biggest cause is lack of maintenance or fuel
pump/filter
problem)

(Nomex suit now on)  I personally think that your CRX has less chance of 
leaving you stranded.  Although yours is full of modification, it is
normaly
easy to get parts at any part store if required.  japanese car are very
well
design and, having work on mine, very straightforward.  HOWEVER, the 928
complications
comes from stuffing a big engine in a small frame while trying to get
the most out
of it and still meet emission and having a high level of comfort. 
Putting all this
in one package cannot be made simply...
