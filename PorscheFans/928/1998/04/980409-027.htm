Greetings fellow shark tamers...

My '83s has had a small oil leak from what looks like the camshaft
covers on both sides of the engine.  Recently changing the oil to
synthetic has seem to make the problem a little worse, as I expected.

While the leak is still small and doesn't worry me too much, the
constant smell of burning oil being sucked in through the vent intake
is getting to me.

What I'm wondering is, can the camshaft cover gaskets be changed
without taking the engine out of the car?  It seems like a tight fit,
especially on the passenger side, what with the air pump tubing and
the coolant reservoir.

If anyone has successfully accomplished this and has any advice, I
would greatly appreciate it!

TIA-
-Peter Athans
