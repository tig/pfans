>Thanks for all the answers.
>A couple of questions though:
>1.  How did you mount the smaller vw battery  (ie battery goes in and you

Wood block.

>2.  when you disconnected the fan and belt, did you have to run the
>electric fan in front of the a/c or install a new fan running inplace of
>the driven fan .

I deleted the A/C fan.

>7 hp ?????wow , thats a lot of power.   If you drive a

Theorically, it will be worse, due to efficency losses in the alternator, 
and the electric fan motor.  However, when your moving along, and you 
have a decent radiator, the fan does not come one, assuming it is 
thermostatically-controlled.  I merely wired mine to the existing 
temperature switch at the lower right side of the radiator.  Works great. 
The other thing is that at high RPMs the thermostatic fan is more of a 
heavy-load than the electric, even with all the electrical 
inefficiencies. 

>The power has to come from somewhere!!    Question is , is the 928 cooling
>system enought to cool the engine in a

>even when I had a clogged radiator, it never got over normal .  (until I
>stopped and idled for 1 or 2 min, then it shot up)
>3.  What did you do to get your beast down to 3150    (big diet)

Items removed: A/C condensor, A/C pump/lines, carpeting, spare tire, 
pump, tools, cat, resonator, factory muffler, radio, etc.  And lots of 
small things, like front grill, A/C fan, no spoilers, L-jetronic 
computer/wiring, etc.

>4.   Does that air pump drive any other vacumme driven functions on the 928
>engine.  (besides the cat )  Would you remove the air pump after you passed
>smog?

No.
Yes, but I think it would pass w/o it being hooked up.

>5.   You said the europe version had more displacement.  it that true.  I
>thought it was just the items you mentioned too.

4.7L vs. 4.5L

>(glad to hear injection is reletively the same whether or not euro)

Only the same in that the maximum power output is virtually the same.
