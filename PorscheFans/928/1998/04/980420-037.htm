Thanks for the great shot my "28" on your sight.
Hope you can make it on Sat.  If you want to stay at a hotel in SJ or
cambell we can rally in the am around 6:30.  about an hour and some chang=
e
at 75mph.  or you could stay at  my house the night before , thats ok wit=
h
me.  Im in saratoga near los gatos.    Any others and we could all shark
rally in the morning to the track!!

Try and get the other boys together especially Jim M and Devek.  (susan,
mark?????? where are you??)
The special event will be awsome.  However, you might want to go in group=
 2
or 3 if you want to be a little mellow.
3 is still tons of fun, 1-2 are sometimes too slow and more traffic jams
because of passing only on the straights.

Im torn between the porsche , ferarri, viper special  class and the class=

4.  Probably, the special class as I could get some good video of all the=

trick cars as they are passing or Im passing!!  =


   Anyway, my buddy from LA is coming up with his stroker Devek monster.
6liter. I drove it out of the shop and man was it fast.  took my video
camera  (as always) andvideo 'ed the spedo running from 60mph to 100 in
under 6 seconds!!!!!!   Mine was 12 and change stock, now im in the 9.8se=
c
range for just headers and exhaust.   dyno is in the 260hp  305torque ran=
ge
on the flywheel  (200hp/250torque on the ground)
.
