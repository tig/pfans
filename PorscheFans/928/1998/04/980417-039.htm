Shark Meisters:

O.K. Everyone who responded to my "mystery object" question on the
driver's door agreed it is a coin holder. Apparently, this question was
so easy (judging by the extremely high ratio of correct answers, not to
mention the thinly disguised sarcasm that accompanied more than a few
responses) that it can only be worth one bonus point. But I'm still
puzzled, how did you all know what it was? I looked through the owner's
manual (and, of course, all 9 volumes of the repair manuals) and found
NO mention, or even depiction, of the darn thing.

By the way , I never thanked many of you for your input on my "always
on" heat problem, partly because its been unseasonably cool here lately
(and I've been procrastinating), but I noticed a hopeful development
this morning. There was an slightly audible "click" sound and, at least
for several moments, cool(i.e. unheated) air coming out. (I should add
that the one thing I had tried was sticking a Q-tip into the dash sensor
slots and trying to clean the induction fan blades off) This clicking
phenomenon repeated several times, at irregular intervals. Perhaps the
shark is a self-healer, and by simply practicing my character defect of
procrastination its going to fix itself. But just in case it doesn't, I
was wondering if this new development sheds any light on the mystery for
anyone.
