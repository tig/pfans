Hello all
My buddy who works at a porsche garage has told me that they have a set of
the newer heads and cams or either they are the euro ones.  Sorry can't
remember which right now.  How hard or is it possible without computer or
extensive modifications to install these on my 83s auto.  My car only has
33,000 miles so I don't want to do anything that will hamper it in the
longrun, but I have to do something to it to set apart from others. I have
the customizing bug.  I'm waiting for I think it's David Roberts to get
those cat-bypasses for my car. Cmon Dave!  
Has anyone added those cool looking white or blue ion headlights to an
older 928 yet?  If anyone has please let me know where and how much these
cost.  I always see new mark Vlll's running around with those.  
Also I removed the doorpanel to replace a blown speaker using some advice
in earlier post about this subject, but noone let me know that the speaker
is a screw-ball one piece design.  The 3  1/2 in. speaker is molded to a
large plastic plate and cannot be removed to be replaced be a new one.  You
must rig your new speaker up to fit securely.  Anyway the speakers I used
were from some porsche that my buddy grabbed from work for me to try, and
they were too deep so I'm without the speaker on the passenger side for
awhile.  Better than the rattle from the blown one though!
The foam was rotted away from about half of the original speaker. I'm
surprised the other speakers still work as bad as that one was!  I can't
wait to try and get to those ones in the rear.  

You should see the 928 racecar that was at my buddies shop last time I
visited.
Huge widebody flares on all corners with three inch exhaust.  Not the
prettiest looking car but it looks AWESOME to me!  I'm biast though. 
Enough rattling on.

I saw a beautiful metallic blue pre 87 928 the other day coming from
Edwardsburg area of Michigan into Mishawaka Indiana. If your on the list
drop me a line or sell your car to me!  Very sharp color.
Thanks for any info on my questions, it's always very appreciated.
