Ok, am I ever going to see another 928 on the track except for me???/
You guys are really pissing me off.  All this talk about race rubber,
stroker kits,
cams, ignition wires ,  shaved heads ......Com'on.    What will it take t=
o
make you =

realize how much fun these cars are on the track.
(you dont even have to push  it.   example:  I never pushed my motor pass=
ed

5 grand and I was beating race ready, rx7 turbos and some , not all , of
the full race rx7s.
The one car that just distroyed me ,was a full race NSX .  It wasnt until=
 I
stopped after my
beating ( I was200ft from a hard left andgoing 100mph and he ran around m=
e
like i was standing still),
that I found out it was a race prepared NSX with a Nitro kit !    No
wonder.  I wonder how long that motor will last.

Laguna is having a rare event all school all weekend and a special open
class school for Ferraris, porsches, and vipers. as well as vintage racer=
s.
  Anyway, very safe.
May 2-3 is the date.!!!!!!!
