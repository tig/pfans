Without a doubt, the maintenance on a 928 can exceed $1,000 a year.  Gi=
ven
these are high performance Porsche cars, you can't expect to pay a barg=
ain
price for a 88-89 928 S4 and then expect it to not require any repairs.=
  Many
common repairs on the 928 can be done by yourself.  It requires good to=
ols, the
factory manuals (about $300) and patience.  If you don't know what you =
are
doing, you can TOTALLY screw up one of these cars.  This is not a Ford
Mustang.  Depreciation of a new sports car will FAR exceed any addition=
al costs
associated with the maintenance of this car.  I  would much rather put =
$1000 a
year into my 928 than take the depreciation hit on a new car.  See Phil=
's page
on buying a new 928 ... best advice on the 'net.
