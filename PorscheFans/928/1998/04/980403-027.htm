After 30+ years of buying used cars, I have discovered that in most cases
you are 'buying' the owner as much as you are buying the car.

And although I have generally forund Porsche people to be above average in
honesty, there are a few who figure that there are enough suckers out there
for every lousy car they can find.

When I was looking for a track car last Spring, I looked at a $3,000 '83
being sold by a guy who had taken it in trade. Very pretty, very straight,
but the trans howled like a banshee and it seemed to hit on a maximum of 6
or 7 cylinders... In other words, a $3,000 car with a potential $5,000 in
needed repairs.

I also looked at a $4,000 Euro '84 that didn't have a straight panel on it,
serious electrical problems, a broken exhaust header and a 'pending' lein
sale title.

It may seem at first that a one or two (caring) owner car with reasonable
mileage might cost a lot more than the lowball cars you see in the paper.
But ultimately, you generally come out ahead paying a premium for a
'creampuff'.

I heard this for years, and thought I could outsmart the old guys who told
me this, but I've learned the hard way that it's true. And even if you find
this one owner car, the owner may be aware of an impending repair problem
that's so expensive that he will be uncustomarily dishonest just to get it
off his back.

Porsches can cost 2-3 times the purchase price to repair. Even if you get
the parts from David Roberts or Mark Anderson. That's why I get a thorough
mechanical check-out from a recommended shop, even if the car is thousands
of miles away. It's cheap insurance.

Sorry if some of this sounds pedantic, but it cost me thousands of
dollars--and some anguish--to learn it.
