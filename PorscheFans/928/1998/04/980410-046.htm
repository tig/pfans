You may want to sit down for this.  I have been farting around with the same
problem with my 84.  ABS light is on after starting car,  roll a ways and the !
light comes on.  Kurt Gibble, John White and myself have been bouncing a few odd
ideas on the sensors.  Haven't figured out how to test them buggers yet!

84 euro S, with ABS (well, sorta)
