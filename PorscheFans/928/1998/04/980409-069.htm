Mark,
First explain to me were I wrote anything about wheel weight, I am confused.

I think you need a little better understanding of how the rear suspension
works on a 928 ;-)

The "toe effect" is achieved with the use of rubber bushings and a flexible
suspension member. The amount of flex ("toe effect") was designed with the
factory tire size and width (and the forces they can exert) in mind.

If you add tires that enable you to pull more lateral "Gs" this will flex
the system much farther that it was designed and cause undesirable effects,
hence the "pinning" or elimination of the flex in the rear suspension by the
Pros.

This is also why most Real Race cars have rigid bushings or some even
bearing type bushings to eliminate the flex found in most production
suspension components for obvious reasons ( I hope I don't have to explain
why this is desirable ;-).

I know you must realize that a 928 with a set of 315s vs 245s (given same
compound, of course)  will certainly be able to exert much higher lateral
forces on the suspension.

Let me give you a simple example:

If a wimp (small tires - 225 or 245s) pulls on a rubber band he will only be
able to stretch it to a certain point. This is the factory designed spec.

Now let Superman (Big tires - 315s) pull on the rubber band and it will
stretch much easier and farther.
Which will exaggerate the "toe effect" way to much and make it a negative
asset instead of a positive one on the race track.

This is just common sense, forget the math, trig, BS etc.

Now if this system was a rigid designed "toe-effect" system it would be a
different story because it would only allow a certain degree of "toe effect"
no matter what width tire weight, lateral forces, etc.

It's NOT.

If you don't believe me (and Mark Anderson, and Marc Thomas and Lucky Ekman
and many others),
do like everyone else has and try it for yourself and give us your results.
I think once you stuff some 315 rubber under your 928 you might not like the
"toe-effect" that you will be getting.

Concerning the S4 exhaust if you will look closer at Mark's article he does
say that he changed his exhaust system (not manifolds), there is obvious
room for improvement in that area, but not in the manifolds..

Since you seem to have easy access to a dyno how about running these tests.
Run your dyno test on a S4 with the stock exhaust and a set of aftermarket
headers. Compare this to stock, my guess is that you will not see much
improvement.
Now run a dyno with stock S4 manifolds and a custom exhaust, compare this to
custom headers and the same custom exhaust.... you might be very surprised
at the results.
This is the point Mark is trying to make.

P.S. I think there is MUCH more to a 928 than 60-100 times, if that is all
we should talk about on this site we should sell our 928s, buy Mustangs with
NOS systems and change the site name to "Mustang Bottle Babies" and call it
a day. ;-0
