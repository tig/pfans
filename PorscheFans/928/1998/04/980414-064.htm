Did someone reply to this already?  

When I did the full carpet set on my 911 I had good luck
with 3M adhesive spray.  Now they have a whole slew of
formulations too - start by checking at automotive stores
and possibly home improvement centers.

Heed caution about good ventilation, that's alot of pieces
and you could start going bananas...

Which/whose carpet set did you get?  New OEM or replica
carpet?  From?  Price?  I've been thinking about getting
that $250 set (new) from World Upholstery but really don't
absolutely need new carpets (while it's sitting there ;)

How did the company provide panels for the various box
covers - specially cut patterns?
