Well, after a false start with part I of this story,  I
ordered a 'new' recovered part from 928 International for
less than I thought it would be.  New covers from Porsche if
available at all list close to $1,000 right?  928
International is redoing covers for sale to 928 fans for
$295 outright! 

I got my cover yesterday and it was in the car within
minutes.  Nice, new black cloth, I think it makes the car
look newer too.  The recover design is minus the lower
zippered halves, instead using a one-piece design.  Good
stitching and the leading edge is reinforced with a black
vinyl strip.  I'll probably never use those halves anyways!  

Two thumbs up to Mark for making these covers available - I
dig it alot!

Question - will tech make you remove the cover before
heading onto the track?  Just wondering as it is a nice
piece and I'd hate to have it walk off unexpectedly while on
track.  What about AX's?   What's pretty cool is I'm
guessing a harness bar will hide underneath it just fine,
harnesses included, as the stock stretch cord is still used
for the cover hardware.  Again, a very nice piece.

Still no word from Porsche on my coils and GTS shifter. 
With all these new black accessories maybe a nice Momo wheel
isn't too far behind?  (do not start the airbag thread again
please!)
