In the words of Bill Clinton, "I feel your pain!"  Right after buying my
Shark, it went to the shop for 1 month. I was weeping daily, reading the
daily list two and three times dreaming of the day I would be able to dri=
ve
the car I had purchased.  At one point I lost all sanity and went in to t=
he
shop and said, "I don't care what it costs, just fix it!!!  =3D-0  ".  Th=
e
bottom line is that once everything was fixed,  I've lived my dream every=

single day.  It is hard to describe the feelings you get of driving it
daily, cruising down the freeway relaxing, then having some "hoon" tailga=
te
you  for a little and poking the throttle to pull away with ease while
kissing 100 effortlessly. No sweat, no drama, just world class performanc=
e
out of your daily driver. It was worth the wait and worth the monetary
sacrifice.  But,  just like Moira's tale of woe,  not every 928 gets the
loving overindulgent care that most people on this list provide.  if anyo=
ne
is considering buying a shark,  their best bet is referrals from someone =
on
this list. I paid for bringing my Shark up to snuff but am now fully secu=
re
in the knowledge that everything is done right. Moira will feel that
security soon. For those considering buying one,  get a pre purchase
inspection by someone extremely reliable DEVEK DEVEK DEVEK or someone as
knowledgeable  as they are. You will feel tons better and will not
experience all the fix its that new owners encounter. But on the other
hand, I drive mine every single day rain or shine, and have no regrets. G=
o
for it.
