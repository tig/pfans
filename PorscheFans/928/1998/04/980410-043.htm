Have lost the thread as to whether this discussion is about Mark 
Anderson's article, or my posting about twisting hot rodder's axle 
shafts. In either case the twist could be considered accumulative. Not 
an immediate windup to two revolutions but a permanent deformation 
accumulated over time.

What 3" diameter drive shaft are you thinking about? The 928's is 
somewhere around 1" in diameter.

I am a Mechanical Engineer by education, embedded software and digital 
hardware engineer by choice 
(http://www.tbe.com/products/imperium/imperium.html was/is my baby), but
lately (off and on the past 8 years) my employer has found out I can run
Unix systems and networks pretty well so I end up doing that.

'83 928S
FreeBSD 2.2.6-stable
Irix 5.3XFS, 6.2, 6.3
Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6.0
MacOS 7.6.1
