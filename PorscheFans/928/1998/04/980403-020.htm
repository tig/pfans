Dear All,

My worst nightmare has come true today. Last week, I had post-purchase 
service at an official Porsche dealer on my 86 928S to prepare the car
for a long drive 2000 miles holiday during Easter
(from Netherland to Italy and back).

The Porsche mechanic replaced the belt (serial no 92810515750, can 
some one please tell which belt is it?), re-tensioned the timing
belt, fixed the leak around the camshaft.  Very expensive service.

On the way to work today, I saw the belt warning came on while
driving at 100km/hour.
Look for safe place to park the car.  Smelt some smoke, so I tried 
to stopped the car immediately with a truck behind flashing its light, 
hurrying me to drive faster.

Stopped the car, open the bonnet, saw some smoke poured out of the
left cam cover.  My heart stopped and I almost fainted when I
saw flame leaped from a hole in the cam cover-around the crankshaft.

Tried to find water to put out the fire. No water.  Tried to wave
cars driving by asking for help.  No one stopped.

Flame is getting higher and higher.  In my mind, I saw the whole
car exploded in flame.   Few months ago, I saw a whole car exploded
and burned in front of my house, a fire engine came too late.  There
was nothing left of the car.
In panic, I used a bottle of ATF for the
power steering to put out the fire.  No effect.  Tried to
cover the fire with my jacket to smoother the fire.  No good, it 
burned a big hole in my favourite jacket.
Closed the bonnet to smoother the fire.  No good.

Prayed to GOD very hard then I saw some water in a puddle on the side of 
the road.   Tried to scoop the water in my hand- no good.  
Took off another jumper, soak it in water, and wring the water 
over the fire.  It worked, no more fire.

Now the car is back in the dealer's garage.  Look like a bolt
in the tensioner broke, letting the cam belt rubbing against
some thing.  Some how it got very hot near the cam-belt. 
Still don't know what caught fire, the cam-belt
or the oil near the tensioner?

Any one has similar experience?  Is this caused by the last week
Porsche service by over-tensioned the belt?  I did not have this
problem before the service.  Or this is due to bad luck on my
part?  Hope it will not too expensive.  I can not afford to
spend anymore money on the after paying the last week Porsche
service.

So next time you see the funny red light came on your dash board,
bring along a fire extinguisher before you open the bonnet.
I was lucky that there was a puddle of water near the car.
