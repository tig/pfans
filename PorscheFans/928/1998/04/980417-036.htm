Well, I have to hand it to Andy McIntyre, his choice of suspension mods
for
an S4 seems superb! (Thanks Andy)

I had the Weltmeister (sp?) springs and Koni "Special" shocks fitted
yesterday,
along with the adjustable front perches.  I've had the ride height left
standard (the
shark is low enough to cause problems in my car park as it is) and had
the 
shocks set for firm, rather than "shake your fillings out".

Of course, it's Auckland Autumn weather right now, so it's raining this
morning
and I only had a brief drive in the dry, but so far I have noticed two
things:

1)  It's on rails.  Apparently the rear shocks were a bit sad anyway,
but the thing
     points in now like magic.  It feels like the SE, only more so.  The
way it was
     when I got it reminded me too much of my 535.  Now, it feels more
like my
     neighbours Ferrari, or a go-kart.

2)  It doesn't axle-tramp any more under heavy (ok, wheelspin)
acceleration.  It
     just puts the power down and, ummm, boogies.  I won't really
experiment with
     this while I am on borrowed Bridgestone S02s, but I'll update you
all on the
     rear suspension stability once I have finally decided what tyres to
fit.

It's going in to the exhaust place today to get (a) an opinion and (b) a
rear-muffler
change.  (Getting the RMB from David in the US, alas, proved so
expensive for
freight that I found the guy who does race exhausts for the local 911s
and asked
him to put something together for me.) 

This is fun!
