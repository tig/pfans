Mark Anderson is the the 928 Master.  (Along with Deveks Group)

Mark, a world of respect for what you have done with your cars.  I too ha=
ve
the best satisfation and fun, running with all of the track prepared 911s=

with  my almost stock 928 and driving it home after the event.  =

In his/Your  article, I have 3 problems.  Did any one else read it =

(European car this month)
1.  How does a  torque tube 4 fee long made of steel , spin up 1 or 2
turns!!!?  (It wont! before it bends and stays that way!!!)  was that a
misprint, as you ment to say 1or 2 degrees????

2.  Why disengage the Weisache rear ends toe-in- on- braking  just becaus=
e
you are running =

larger width tires and rims  (8s vs 11s)    the Toet change of 1/4 degree=

on a 8 inch is the SAME as 1/4 degree =

on a 11" rim . (basic math)    AS long as the diameter of the rim is the
same, the toe will angle the tire out the same
 1/8inch or so for any width tire.  (you will just have more meat angled =
in
on braking at the exact same angular movement. As 1/18" each tire in on 1=
7'
diameter  is 0.0125/17 INV TAN=3D  1/4 degrees of one wheel toe
Mark, care to comment???????????)  This just common trig math.

3.    Headers  give about 10% Call me crazy, but I tested my 84 before i
removed the cat and after . gained 10 foot lbs, put on the headers, gaine=
d
another 15 foot lbs and then put on the race exhause, gained another 15
foot lbs.  (that was the part that was amazing)   so total gain to the re=
ar
wheels was 35 foot lbs. from stock   (Measured all on the Dyno in Fremont=

cal.)  I went from 215 foot lbs  stock  to the rear wheels to 250 to the
rear wheels, 15% gain.
my 60 to 100mph times went from around 12 seconds to 9.0 seconds.  (teste=
d
with video camera twelve times)
Mark, how do you argue with the 248e dyno?????
signed respectfully,
Mark K
84 928
PS
When are you going out to willows next.  All the california sharks should=

make it out to one of the events you are driving in and partisipate in th=
e
school or  open track event .   What type of events are you running in no=
w
with your white shark.
Anyone else care to post 60 to 100 times??????    Now that would make thi=
s
thread interesting.  =

 Im sick of hearing of car fires and crashes lights that wont go on or of=
f,
cars that wont start.
that information is good , but we neet INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE POSTS.=
 =

such as:

ride hights
compression tests
dyno tests  HP and Torque figures after and before mods.
60-100 mph tests tests and times
track times =

etc.                        =
