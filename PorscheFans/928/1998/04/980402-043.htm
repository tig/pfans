It will be interesting to install the original fan
without the air pump.  the belt adjuster is on the
air pump...

Thanks.  For general interest, I didn't actually
chuck the whole airpump assembly.  I am
freewheeling it.  I removed it (2 bolts) and
disabled the the rotors (this can be done either
with finesse or with violence; the result is the
same,although I want to save the equipment in
case the law ever makes me put it back).  It
retains it's position in the pulley triad, so there
are no slack belts on my car, or pants.  I want to
toss the hoses in the drawer as well, and plug the
holes to the air filter, etc., but I'm unsure of how
far I can go.  I only am doing it to stay basically
clean and logical, not to gain power, but I
wouldn't doubt that there is a horse or two to be
gained, as well as the common sense of losing 15
pounds of equipment.  The original suggestion
came when a mechanic noticed that the airpump
was grumbling, so why have it working hard at
all.
