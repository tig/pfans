From Azar Rauf



Dear PorscheFans,

I have zero knowledge about 928s and am hoping someone on the list can 
shed some light on the following:

Recently a GTS I was looking at was diagnosed, by a Porsche mechanic, as 
having oil leakage from the steering column. He seemed to think that it 
wasn't a 'serious' problem and one that could be fixed with a quick trip 
to any decent Porsche 928 servicing centre. I didn't get the whole story 
because my German is zero and his English wasn't brilliant either.

I'm wondering is what he says true ?? 

thanks in advance
