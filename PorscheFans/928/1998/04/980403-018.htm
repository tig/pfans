What he said, whoever it was, is right.  If you flip
open the amp cover on the floor starboard of the
passenger seat, the clicker should be a little
motor that has a plastic electrical plug.  Unplug it
as a test and see if the noise goes away when
you drive.  You can always plug it back in later.

I have the same wheel click on my '84. I'm sure
the noise is coming from the
outside of the car near the right front wheel. I
can only hear it when I'm
driving with the passenger window down and go
by something that will rebound
the sound back to me (i.e. parked car). The noise
does go away as soon as I
touch the brakes-even if it is very slight pressure.
I recently put new
tires on (thanks Brian Buxton) and while the
wheel was off looked for
anything in the brake assembly that might be
loose. Could not find a sign of
anything wrong. Any ideas?

Thanks,
