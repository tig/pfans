Kevin, I could not find any vacuum leaks yesterday. I took out the air 
cleaner box and checked out all the lines I could find, all had good 
vacuum and I sprayed carb cleaner on them, no change. I could not find 
the idle adjustment mechanism. Where is it? The hood sticker shows it's 
not far from the air cleaner box and on the driver's side. Is there one 
for each side or one for both injector logs? Please let me know. Thanks.
