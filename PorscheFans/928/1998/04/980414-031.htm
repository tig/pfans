	I have a 1983 S.  It is light Blue metallic.  I have had it for a while and
	have noticed that I have SOMEHOW gotten a very faint spray of paint on it.
	ALL OF IT !  It isn't noticeable to the eye, but the car has a very light
	sandpaper texture to it.  I thought it was a bad paint job at first, but a
	review of the glass on the car shows the same thing.  My suspicion is I was
	parked in the wrong place at the wrong time, as spray painting was going on.

	Assuming that the auto finish is stronger than the "new" paint, can anyone
	recommend a product and procedure to remove it? I have tried waxes and
	buffing compounds, and these really didn't cut it.  I used a rotary buffer
	with some generic "once-a-year-car-polish" as well.  All I got from that was
	swirl marks.
	[snip]
	Many thanks in advance.

I would leave it to the professional.  They probably would have to wet-sand it with 1000
grit sandpaper and buff it with a professional compound.  I would have them do the whole
car while they're at it.  They have all the tools and materials to do the job right.  Take
it to a reputable body shop and get their opinion.  You can do it yourself, but not for
the faint of heart.
