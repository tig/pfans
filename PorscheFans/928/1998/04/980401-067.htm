Hello all,
I'm way behind on the list and trying to catch up......just a note about
warped brake rotors......One scenerio which is a common cause of warped
rotors, (especially the fronts) is when you go to the car wash. Be careful,
especially after hard brake usage, that you don't drown the rotors with the
cool water spray. When you wash your wheels, and you're trying to blast all
the dust from the wheel spokes / slots, take care to cool the rotors
slowly.....not all at once......(I know the giant steam cloud effect is neat
to marvel at, but you must fight the urge to appease your "warped" sense of
humor)
Glad to be back to work, but quickly reminded how much free time is taken by
working for a living. It's taken me 4 evenings to do a super-detail on ol'
supercar's interior, (and it was clean to start with) ......figure at the rate
I'm going, I should have the exterior washed, and quite possibly, waxed, by
the fall "Frenzy" event.     :-) 

Best to all,
Greg Schickel
