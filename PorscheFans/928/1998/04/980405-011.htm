....On my way to a track to see what was going on this weekend, I passed
some slow moving cars in the left lane, touched redline(rev limited) 
motor
bucked, then started running very poorly, car would only drive about 25
mph and would
only rev to about 3500rpm.  Cats were getting VERY hot.  (snip)

Glenn- I had a similar problem on my 91S4.  All of a sudden one bank
(one side) of the engine whould shut off, really rough idle, and I could
barely get it going above 25-30mph. I would disconnect the battery, and
it would start and run fine.  The po had it looked at a few times, and
had several ignition components changed (not cheap). When it started
happening to me, I originally thought water may be getting into the fuse
panel because it seemed to happen after it rained or after washing the
car. I found some water near the fuse panel , and had all gaskets and
drainage tubes replaced on sunroof. Inside was now bone dry but it
happened again.  After snooping around the engine, I found a split in
the ignition wire leading to the coil on the passenger side.  I guess 
this wire caused a miss, and there is a relay that can shut down either
side of the engine.  I had my technician replace the wire, and the relay
(it was a clear cube, that had a red and green light inside it) just in
case it was the relay itself.  No more problems, that was almost two
years ago.  Hope this helps, I know I got lucky.

This is my first post to PorschFans.  I hope I did it right.
