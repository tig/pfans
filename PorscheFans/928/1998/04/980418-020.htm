I have never known a car that behaved differntly than you describe 
after being washed. The door is designed to handle water from the 
window. There are drains. And on non-Porsches there will be sheilds 
around speakers installed in the doors. My '83 928S has an aluminum 
plate behind its speakers to protect them from the wet window.

Don't think your doors are filling up with water, think the seals were 
wet and wetted the glass as it rose.
