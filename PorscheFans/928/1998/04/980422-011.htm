I did and it works!

I was facing a total recharge of R12 due to a leak in the expansion valve
over winter (run those ACs at least once a week to make sure they still
work!)  Larry, my good friend and excellent Porsche mechanic
(volks@ix.netcom.com), totally drained the system of R12 (took a couple of
days to make sure it totally boiled out of the dryer) and took as much of
the oil out of the system as he could.  He then put in four ounces of a new
oil that can cohabitate with any residual older R12 and serve the system
which was recharged with R134.  

Does it work?  You betcha!!!!  Other than the switch in the oils, nothing
else was required to make it run.  The AC blows cold (important here in
Houston) and I'm a happy camper yet again!  I asked about the O-Rings and
seals and how they would react to R134.  Apparently, R134 is not as
corrosive as was previously thought and no change outs are required.  Since
spring is just beginning and the heat is on its way, I'll give y'all a
driving report in a couple of months to let you know how well the switch
over worked out.

Take Care,

I've noticed the posts on air conditioning are starting to appear again ...
talked about converting to R134 and said that there  was a new oil out that
you simply add to the system after removing the R12 and then all you need do
is recharge with R134. No need to flush or even remove the old oil. Sounds a
little to good to be true ... Anyone tried this already?
