Shark-meisters:

Is it just me or has anyone else noticed that we get an uncanny amount
of "unexplained", and frequently unexplainable, behavioral quirks from
these beasts? As an example, I had my "!" warning light come on late
Sunday evening. I pretty much freaked, pulled right over to the curb...
and the light went out. I sat for a few moments collecting my wits, no
other warning lights or anomalies, and continued on my way. So far, no
recurrences, and nothing suspicious as I did a once-over in the garage.

My biggest regret as far as this non-event goes was that I didn't notice
which warning light was associated with the "!". Do I have it right that
some function light has to be associated with a legitimate "!" warning?
