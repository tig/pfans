Thanks to my 13 months of diligence and all the great information I get =
here, I now have possession of  my very own 1988 928 S4. Yippee for me!

For those who care, (and you all do...) the car is red, with a tan =
leather interior. The PO spent a ton of $ on the car in the past 18 =
months (he had an extended warranty that covered the bulk of the cost) =
he replaced the torque tube and steering rack; a timing belt failure =
mandated a bunch of new valves and some top end work on the engine. =
Oddly enough, as if this weren't financially painful enough, he replaced =
the carpets, the rear view mirror the radio speakers and the sun visors! =
Throw some work on the A/C and new set of tires, and I feel like this =
car is either cursed or ready for action!

Now for the questions;

#1 --  I took the car in this AM to get the alignment checked/set and =
the mechanic and I quickly determined that the left rear hub bearing is =
very loose/shot. Anybody out there performed this repair and have a =
time/cost of parts analysis?

#2 -- My A/C seems to be in the midst of a rebellion; it worked.. it =
didn't.. it worked.. Now the system will only blow hot air, even with =
the switch set to the |_| square thingy.  Seems like the =
flaps/valves/elves that control the air mixture are dancing to the beat =
of their own drummer, as opposed to responding to the requests of the =
vehicle operator (me)

Any input appreciated!
