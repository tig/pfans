Where do I begin?  First let me start by saying that the article expresses
my opinions which are just that.  I do not claim to be the definitive source
for all 928 answers.  I do however have the experience that comes along with
building 5 928 race cars, dismanteling over 150 928's, and competively
racing 928's for 10 years.  Some of the comments I made in the article came
from what I believe to be knowledgeable people.  (such as the shaft twisting
inside the torque tube.)  I don't have a degree in engineering or anything
else for that matter.  Sometimes I can barely spell, as witnessed by this
post.  
My comment about headers has plenty of dyno sheets to back it up.  Since
that article was written I have put 3 different sets of headers on.  Some
lost alittle some gained alittle.  The best gain was 13 hp from a stock
system to MSDS headers and a single 3.5" exhaust with a flow master muffler.
I have not given up on exhaust and I hope there is more to find.  I do
believe that the 2 valve cars can benifit much more from headers.  The early
cast iron manifolds leave something to be desired.  The later 4 valve
stainless manifolds are very good.  They make a noticable difference on
early cars and they fit nicely. I don't want to take up too much space here,
but if anyone has questions on what I've done, I have no secrets.  Just ask,
I'll be glad to help if I can.
Sincerely
