Fellow Brethren:

I have finally received approval from the Great One (the wife) to 
purchase my own 928.  My name is Scott Brown I'll be 31 this Tuesday, 
I currently live in Philadelphia, PA and work for the Department of 
Labor.  I am an Aries and have 2 cats (not by choice, but love them 
anyway) I'm into  ponies...  Ugh, how's that for an attempt at a joke? 
 I have been lurking for many months now and have read every post up 
until 3/15/98, almost there.  I especially love all those repeating 
posts so long ago. I think I will post this to all the PorscheFans 
lists.  Well, anyway, I'm looking for an '87-'89 S4, it must be 
automatic, due to a disability. (hi, Jim-what kind, if any, hand 
control do you use?)  I have to finance the whole thing so I'd like to 
keep the cost of the car with necessary repairs and maintenance between
$17,000 and $24,000.  (the lower the better.)  Got anything for me Brian?
Send an E-mail to discuss potential deal.  Are there any ways to find a
cheaper loan 
other than an unsecured personal loan?  Also, here in Philly,  insurance is
big bucks, $3000./yr..  I will insure outside the city  but could use some
suggestions on good insurance companies.  If there is anything you would like
to tell me as I begin my search that to would be appreciated.  There is so
much good information in these archives, unfortunately I can't remember where
it all is.  Well, I 
would say that I at least have a clue as to what to look for but any tips, no
matter how repetitive, will still be appreciated.  Please E-mail me directly
with redundant information so we don't bore the veterans. Please send to both
address's (ha ha ha, take that) when you E-mail me, thanks.  BTW Phil, nice
site, love it.  

Thank you my brethren.
