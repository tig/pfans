Hi,
Hopefully someone can assist here.  I met James and his '78 a few months
ago and his '78 is in pretty good shape considering it's a few years older
than James is.  I think the S/N ended in 019????  He has restored/refinished
some very nice little Triumphs.

Patrick (bones)???  (When I look in my engine compartment, and I remember
that Patrick put in a different engine, I am reminded of that Star Trek
episode (when I was a kid!!!) where someone took out spock's brain...)
Don't bap me.  Must be the coffee.
