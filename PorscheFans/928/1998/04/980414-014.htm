Pat,
85 was the first year of the improved trannys, which included the
Borg-Warner syncros instead of the dog gone dog-teeth syncros and the
"reverse lock-out".

They are pretty much the same through 89 with the exceptions of the LSD
option (any year) and the 89 2.72 gear ratio change. (85-88 US 2.20)

To clarify why I said the 89 GT is the best bet is that it will absolutely
have the 2.72 gear ratio and the LSD (some people like the 2.20 gear ratio
better, most don't).

The problem with the 90 and up trannys is that they have the PSD (computer
controlled LSD) and it is cheaper to sell your 928 and buy a 90 and up vs
retrofitting this tranny and all of its brains, pumps, wiring harnesses,
sensors, etc etc.  into an earlier 928. That is if you want the PSD to work
properly.
