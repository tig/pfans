Ken,

Wow!  I learn something new every day.  Thanks for "correcting" me!  I 
guess the air box studs are NOT supposed to be adjustable!  Guess mine 
(and a few others) are just warped due to age/heat.  Sounds like your 
method should work though...

Hope you don't mind, Ken, but I'm copying this to the list in case I've 
misled anyone.  Sorry y'all :-( .  I'll keep quiet for a while and do my 
penitence...

I can't because one was split >(sheared) in two, and the other was stripped (threads)!
