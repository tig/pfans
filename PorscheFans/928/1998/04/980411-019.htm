Holy cow, this day didn't end up like I thought it would.  Decided to
wash and wax both the cars (928 and SHO), which is something I have
always enjoyed, after being raised by a car nut of a father.  I have
always been happy with the 3 stage system by Mother's, but decided to
use 2 new products: 3M Imperial Hand Glaze and McGuier's (<spelling)
Carnuba Wax step #3. I think Larry Reynolds highly recommended the 3M
product.  I barely finished the 928 after about 4-5 hours solid work.  I
could hardly get the Imperial Glaze (3M) off the car. It dried faster
than you know what, and took almost more grunt that the wife and I both
had to get it off. Ridiculous stuff.  The Carnuba Wax which is usually a
piece of cake, streaked like you wouldn't believe.  It acted like it
wouldn't dry, and was like trying to wipe a thin coat of oil off of
something.  I don't know if this was because of the Glaze or what.  Yes,
it could have been me that was the problem, but I've never had a problem
before.  Wanted to ask if anybody else has had any problems, or
recommends something else.  I will probably just go back to Mother's. 
The car looks great after today (I wish Frenzy was tomorrow), but way
too difficult with this combo. BTW, car was inside, and we used Glaze on
a panel at a time.  Ok, I've calmed down now, this group is my
psychiatrist.  Other car will wait for another day.

Also, when we were washing the 928, my wife unfortunately cut her finger
pretty good on the license plate cover.  Of course finger started to
bleed a little, but I was so proud when I saw that my wife bleeds
Porsche Guards Red.  Now thats a woman.  

Thanks for listening.
