ML,

I have a similar problem with my 86 928S.  I have to really get on the gas 
to get it to kick down.

It's in the shop right now.  My mechanic checked the vacuum at the engine 
and found that the hard plastic hose between the engine and the transaxale 
was full of holes.  No vacuum no shift down.

In addition, the shift modulator is non-functioning.  So, I'm replacing the 
shift modulator and he is using brake line to replace the plastic hose. 
 The brake line at least won't fail over time.  I get my baby back on 
Wednesday.  I'll let you if that solved the problems.

Hope this helps.

Kevin

HI all,

I have an 86 928s and I was wondering what may be causing my trans to
act up.

When I am going about 45mph and want to accelerate faster,
I step on the pedal all the way before the kickdown switch.

Before the car used to shift down, but now it seems to stay
in 4th gear.  I did the same while making a sharp turn on ht e freeway
and it shifted to the lower gear as expected.  What may be causing this and 
what
is the cure?

Thanks,

ML<<
