Well, Darrin, it's actually impossible, even far from the swamp. US 928
cars stopped with the '94 model year, which is the better (lower oil
consumption, no pesky tire pressure warning system) of the two years of the
928 GTS model (US debut in '93).

>what would be a better investment: 5-speed or auto?

Are you buying to drive the car, or hoping that its resale price will go up
and you'll make a killing? The latter is not a good financial play, even
though the 928 market is beginning to perk up. However, 5-speeds are
significantly scarcer, and people will pay more for them.

>i dont know which one is more reliable or more $ to fix.

Both transmissions are strong and reliable, although the hydraulic system
for disengaging the clutch can spring a leak, and clutches eventually wear
out (although this won't be a problem if you're not going to drive the car).

>i need as much info as my little cajun coon-ass brain can digest

Your modesty (or empathy for archy) is apparent from the lower-case "i". Go
ahead and express that ego of yours!
