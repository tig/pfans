Howard,

Regarding MIME messages.  I had the same problem for months, and was
getting flamed for always sending my posts in MIME format.  David Kennedy,
who is obviously a computer pro, finally explained the whole thing to me,
and was kind enough to send me several email pages of tips on how to do
away with it.  I was using MS  Outlook and finally gave up on it and bought
Eudora Pro 4.0.

Even then, whenever I sent a post, I had to manually key in "Uuencode" or
the message would go out in MIME format.  Finally I stumbled across the
solution, which Qualcomm, in their wisdom, didn't bother to put in the 170
page manual that came with the program.

If you go to Eudora; after its' installed, click on Options, then under
"Encoding Method", click on "Attachments", then on "Uuencode".  After that,
all your messages will go out in Uuencode unless you want to revert to
MIME.  If you're running a Mac, click on "BinHex" instead of Uuencode.  The
results will be the same.

I know this will sound absolutely obtuse to all the computer dudes on the
list but I'm a writer, not a hacker.  I  empathize with Dave Barry, who
said in his "Dave Barry in Cyberworld"  "I'm a computer junky.  Much like a
horsepower junky.  I'm sitting here at my tenth computer which could easily
find the solution to "The Grand Unified Theory of the Universe" while
simultaneously doing the tax returns of the entire population of the state
of Michigan.
I use it thusly.  I stare at the screen for ten or fifteen minutes and then
type; "Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot" or something similar".

I know  there's a way to defeat  MIME within the confines of MS Outlook.  I
couldn't find it. Eudora Pro fixed it, but its' much like using a sixteen
pound sledgehammer to drive carpet tacks with.  For whatever its' worth.

Gene O'Rourke
