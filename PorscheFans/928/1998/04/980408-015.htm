	On my 78 the windshield washer pump is on the passenger side front inner
	wheel well, directly under the radiator tank. I've never had to get to
	it, but imagine it may be somewhat awkward since it's difficult to even
	see.

The pump that you are referring to is the main washer pump.  If you need to R/R the main
washer pump (knock on wood..) you'll have to remove the entire reservoir first in order to
get to it.  There is a secondary or booster pump.  This is quite in-line with Porsche's
over-zealous Engineers; and this one is located underneath the area of the coolant
reservoir.
