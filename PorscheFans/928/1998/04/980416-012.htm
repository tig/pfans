I have started replacing various hoses in the cooling system after finding
some in poor condition. The cost here in Aust. from the dealer is such that
I am still looking for the gold plating.

Sizes are generally of standard diameters and, for example, heater hose can
be bought by the metre.  So odd shapes could be made from this if there was
a way to form a bend in the hose permanently without it flattening on the
bend.

I have tried putting a 90Deg. bend in a 10mm hose by heating with hot air
while clamping it in the desired shape.  This was only moderately
successful as I finished with a permanent 45Deg. bend.

Has anybody on the list made up hoses from stock material and formed
permanent shapes? I will be grateful for any advice.

Is there anyone on this list in the Brisbane area?
