Good news,  Bad news,

First the bad news........

 It appears Roswell was a *False  Sighting*.  The winter was not good to HWY
246 out of Roswell and in the name of safety C.A.R.S. has decided to postpone
the UFO Twin 50. The New Mexico department of transpotation could not promise
the frost heaves could be repaired in time.

 Now the good news..............
 
We found a beautifully well engineered highway out of Alpine Texas,  Hwy 118
from Alpine to Study Butte.  75 miles up and 75 miles back.  The road is
great. No ruts no bumps. Lots of shoulder on both sides.  Three lanes in some
places.  The first 29 miles has turns coming down from Alpine,  then 11 miles
of fast straights in the valley,  8 miles of turns,  a 6 mile flat out
straight with a kink,  6 miles and 6 bends, a 4 mile straight and 10 miles of
turns up to Study Butte.  WOW !!   What a Ride !!  Now regrid and do it again
in the other direction... 
  C.A.R.S has the permits from the state of Texas for July 24-26 and this
event will replace Roswell as the second leg in thier National Open Road Race
Championship.
  For those of you concerned about heat,  we are told the average high in july
in Alpine is 88 degrees.  This is at 3PM.,  By then we should all be back in
town telling stories about our drives of a lifetime. 

  You can conctact C.A.R.S. @ (619) 440-6043 or  e-mail rwcars@ix.netcom.com 
for more info.

  It would be a great help if we could all drop Speedvision a line @
www.speedvision.com  .  Tell 'em how much we enjoy seeing Open Road Racing on
speedvision.  It will really help in getting sponsors for the T.V. shows.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there !!!
Rick
