Yikes!
While out of town, I left the Shark at a reputable Porsche garage to
have the transmission oil/filter changed. I asked that they also change
the fuel filter to fill another PM square in the log.  When I returned
this evening to retrieve the car, the manager told me the oil change was
done, but they could not locate the fuel filter on the vehicle! These
guys are top shelf Porsche mechanics and knew exactly where to look for
it, and could even describe in detail the components that make up the
filter assembly. What they did find was a piece of straight hose spliced
in where the fuel filter assembly should be! Needless to say, I'll be
contacting the PO and/or his mechanic on Monday.  In the meantime, has
anybody heard of such a radical (bonehead) procedure?  Perhaps I can get
a filter assembly from 928 International to "splice in"? Thoughts or
condolences will be welcome.
Thanks,
