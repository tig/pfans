Go talk to 928 International and Devek.  These are well-trusted
companies
that do a lot of business with people on this list.  I know 928 Intl has
engines
for sale, and if Devek doesn't, they probably know of ones that are, and
can be trusted to tell you really what shape they're in.  

Also, both of these companies can answer your compatibility questions.
