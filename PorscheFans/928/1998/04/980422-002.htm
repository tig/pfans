>OK, I have polled several '28 owners about their cars and I have received many
"different" views on the car as a whole.  Some say it is extremely expensive
to upkeep, others say it's not that bad...

>Am I
looking to the right vehicle or should I be looking elsewhere...

First, remember that you are talking about cars of an age and mileage
that would qualify most automobiles for the junkyard. And that a part,
or an hour of service, costs just as much for a ten-year-old car as
for a new one (make that "competent service"). Then, go take a test
drive in a 928 or two. At that point, either you will have to have one,
or you shouldn't bother.
