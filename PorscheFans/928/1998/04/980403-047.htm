Mark!  aka Mr. Fun ;)

Yep, I hear upcoming April is the plan.  Driver's Ed deal
right?  Don't have PCA calendar in front of me, do we need
to tech somewhere or ? I need to wear out these D40's
somehow.

Took raincheck on last Wed. Sportsman drags at Sear's -
someone told me it's 1/8 mile during construction and I can
do that anywhere!  Hope the full 1/4 comes back <grumble>.

Ok, friday again, yeehaw!  Permission to buzz the tower?...
