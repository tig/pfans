Dear Porsche Fans:

I am the owner of a 1982 Porsche 928, and am having problems with a
rattling sound that is coming from the front of the engine.  It sounds
like a rattling noise that is possibly coming from the fan behind the
radiator.

My dad and I examined the fan and he said it is most likely the cooling
fan bearing.  I thought it may be a bigger bearing attached to the
pulley coming from the main drive shaft.  Is this possible?

He reached down to move the fan while the engine was stopped and the fan
is moving about an inch in either direction around the shaft...there is
also small speckles of metal dust which looks like some grinding is
taking place around the shaft leading to the fan.  1.  I know this is a
stupid question, but is this fan suppose to move all around the shaft
when you pull it.  The one in his truck was stiff as a board, but I
didn't know if Porsche had a different design that moved or something.

The next question is:  If the problem is a fan bearing, how do I get
this bugger off and how do I loosen the belt.  Can I remove the fan to
get to the bearing without taking the belt off???

If anyone knows anything about my problem, I would really appreciate
your help!

Yours Truly,

Mark Stephens
