David,

Thanks for the information.  I was beginning to worry that I would not have 
a reason to work on the Shark this weekend.  Oh boy!  Now I can take the 
door apart, adjust the window rattle, try to fix the locking mechanism and 
attach the anti-jimmying shield.  If I'm really ambitious, I'll try to 
figure out why the driver door handle is looser than the passenger side.

Who says I don't have a life? ;-)

- Kevin

Kevin,
The "cupped" piece of metal is your drivers door lock shield, it is 
supposed
to be inside your door surrounding the lock assembly to keep someone from
unlocking the door with a "door jimmy".
That is also where your mysterious missing Phillips head screw goes. The
panel mounts inside and is secured by one of the door crash brace bolts, 
one internal Phillips screw and the external screw in the door jam.

Sounds like someone has goofed up your door lock and it just needs to be
re-installed properly which should solve all of the above problems.
