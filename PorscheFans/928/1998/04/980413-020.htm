Hey all!

About a month ago I posted a message moaning about a coolant leak and
soliciting suggestions about where to look.  Well, I found it...  now the
car isn't piddling any more, but there's a big hole in my wallet!

Crawled under the car and found coolant dripping off the oil pan.  Traced
it up to the front of the engine.  Yep, water pump.

Did not pass GO, did not collect $200, and went immediately to my mechanic.
 When they pulled the water pump 7 of the 11 bolts broke, but they were
able to get 5 out and only had to drill 2.  Apparently the previous owners
never replaced the pump, so it had been in there for 14 years and 178,000
miles.

Also got new motor mounts.  Did you know that the motor mounts are filled
with some kind of gel and cost about $400 for a pair?  

Anyway, car runs great once again.  Moral of story... if you're replacing
the timing belt, be sure to replace the water pump too!!!  If you intend to
keep the car, it's really painful to save a few bucks now and spend lots
more bucks later.

John
