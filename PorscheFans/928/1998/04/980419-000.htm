Is BACK!   

With the offshore boat racing within earshot tomorrow in the
bay, I'll be darned if my car was going to sit mute another
night longer!  So, coughing and wheezing all the way I
swapped the passenger coil and fired it up.  HOT DAMN, It's
Alive!  Quick buzz of the bridge and Broadway tunnel felt
like the high rpm kick was stronger & peakier than ever! 
Must stick in the other new coil later!  Maybe open up plugs
even more, currently at 35's...  what are you guys running?

The odd part is the old coil metered out within specs!?!  Go
figure, it sure didn't work installed.  I learned also not
to try to remove the little orange plug on the coil, at
least not while on cold medication.  Started to pull it off
(for curiosity) and the darn thing sprung *into* the hole
never to be retrieved.

Phil is a happy camper once again.  Now about this cold  :|
