PORSCHWAR

PORSCHE in the UK have an ongoing campaign to stop organisations and
business's using their name. PORSCHE have in fact got a copyright in the UK
on the actual word itself.

I am sure everyone understands and supports the marque in their crusade to
stop non franchised bodies using their name. Somewhat harder to understand
however is the fact that they are also threatening bodies of enthusiasts
with court action. Ordering them to cease any mention of the name in any
form in their titles.

Both the British PORSCHE RACING DRIVERS ASSOCIATION and the British "PORSCHE
ENTHUSIASTS" CLUB are in danger of being ground out of existence. The former
includes all UK drivers who race PORSCHE cars and the latter is a small Club
of a little over 800 members. Surely this is total madness attacking
hard-core marque fanatic's in a country in which the cars command some of
the highest secondhand prices in the world.

I believe in Germany alone over 70 "PORSCHE" clubs exist. In the UK we have
3.
The larger ones are PCGB (officially recognised) with 15000+ members and PEC
with 800+ members (mainly running older cars). The smallest club the NEPDC
with under 100 members so far seems to have escaped the exterminators eye.
Any producer of regalia/stationary/newsletters to the PRA or the PEC is
under threat of being closed down and their machines confiscated by the
copyright "watchdog" if those items contain the word PORSCHE.

The marque is in danger of an enthusiast backlash. People have already
talked about  and are organising:

Selling their cars and buying another marque.
Getting petitions organised.
Boycotting the official main dealer garages.
EEC appeal.
Publicised mass removal of badges from cars with Tabloid & TV involvement.

Short of mentioning every model number (which themselves are copyrighted).
What are enthusiasts in the UK to do to show they support PORSCHE if they
cannot even mention the word itself. Even PORSCHEFANS (one word) would be
illegal in the UK.

Any comments or advice before blood is spilt would be appreciated?
