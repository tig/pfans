First thing to do is to get access to the fuse and relay panel (it's
under the passenger footrest). Notice a couple of wires that go over
the top of the panel, reach around behind the panel, and pull out
a couple of in-line fuseholders. These fuses are for the door lock
motors, and one is probably blown. When this happens, the failure of
the one door to lock causes the other door lock to open right up
again. Replace the fuse, and then, at your leisure, put the excess
pieces the PO left you back inside the door.
