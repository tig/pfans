	Hey Gary,

	Where I have a small leak is at teh cam tower/head junction. To the
	untrained eye it would look like a head gasket leak. Is your mechanic
	familiar with the car/engine?

	One area on early MY 928 that alot of mechanic misses is a neoprene washer about
the size of a dime, located between the distributor housing and the cam tower.  There is
an oil galley that goes from the cam tower to the distributor gear for lubrication.  For
some unknown reason, Porsche does not use a sealant or a gasket between the mating
surfaces, but rather rely on the neoprene washer to do the job.  Given time, the neoprene
washer will shrink and you'll have an oil leak.  This leak gives the impression that your
cam seal is bad.  If you have some major oil covering the oil pressure sensor, down to the
oil filter, its a good chance that this is your problem.  Remove the oil filter and look
straight up.  You should be able to see a trail of oil coming from the distributor area.
The neoprene washer cost about $1.50 from the dealer.
