 I have 345s on one of my 928s (there ain't nuthin' wider in the D.O.T. 
world that is Z-rated).  TRUST ME, you WANT the arms pinned.  David 
Roberts, et al, is correct. The rear-end will do some strange, abrubt 
"shifts" during aggressive braking/cornering.
 The simplistic math will not cut it.  It is more complex than that.  I 
empathize with your yearning to reduce these (semi-)complex systems to 
more simple rules that can be more easily understood and analyzed. 
However, there are more degrees of freedom in the suspension.
 As far as the headers go, I have done my own dyno work and found that 
80% of the result can be obtained with just a free flowing exhaust after 
the stock manifolds (with 'H', or a large single).  This is true on the 
early cars.  For the 32v, only about 5-6 hp can be gained from the 
addition of aftermarket headers.
 I do agree with your desire to see more real-world data on the list.  
But, I think the list fairly accurate reflects what the majority needs 
are . It is sort of self-regulating in that; if more people want 
"HP-talk" than "warning-light talk," then it will occur naturally. Again, 
I love the high-performance mod-talk!
