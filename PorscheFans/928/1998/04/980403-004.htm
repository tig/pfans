Kevin,
The "cupped" piece of metal is your drivers door lock shield, it is supposed
to be inside your door surrounding the lock assembly to keep someone from
unlocking the door with a "door jimmy".
That is also where your mysterious missing Phillips head screw goes. The
panel mounts inside and is secured by one of the door crash brace bolts, one
internal Phillips screw and the external screw in the door jam.

Sounds like someone has goofed up your door lock and it just needs to be
re-installed properly which should solve all of the above problems.
