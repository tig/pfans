rob (linda?),

	the brake pr (yes, that's pressure) light means
that the central warning system computer saw different
pressures in the two parts of the master cylinder the last
time the brakes were applied. there are two pressure sensors
in the master cylinder. they are used to turn the brake lights on
and the computer uses them to decide if the master cyl. is 
working properly.

	usually when the light comes on, it means that something has
gone bad in the MC, but it could be a bad connection or a bad
pressure sensor. check the connections first, but you may need
to rebuild the MC, or replace it with a rebuilt or new one.
