Mike, some thoughts and experience for your consideration:

> any inexpensive solutions to lower (ie different spring set) a 79 928?

Not much you do to a 928 fits the "inexpensive" category, at least from
my wife's perspective :).  However, talk to the folks at 928 Int'l for
the height adjustment kit that came on later cars.  Used ones are
available for not too many B. Franklins.

As for the springs, PO had put 270# Weltmeisters on the front.  Lowered
it so much that the fender was below the top of the tire and, except on
perfectly maintained roads (of which there are none in CT), it would
bottom frequently.

If you intend to "track" the car, get Automotion's Welmeister
progressive rate sport spring kit or DEVEK's coil-overs (not stock class
legal, if you intend to go PCA racing) to keep the front off the ground
under heavy braking.  I did the former in combo with adjusters from 928
Int'l, plus Koni adjustables.  VERY firm, but fine for what I do (not a
daily driver).

Contact me directly if any questions.
