On using the 3M Imperial Hand Glaze:

The instructions on the bottle are pretty clear, especially regarding how
big a slice to try and bite off at a time.  I have good luck doing a patch
maybe one foot square (as recommended) or maybe a bit smaller.  Rub it until
it gets dry, then continue rubbing with a separate clean dry cloth until the
stuff is completely removed.  The transition point from "application cloth"
to "clean removal cloth" seems to be when it starts to squeak when you are
rubbing.  From your description,  you may have been putting this stuff on
like liquid wax instead of the polish that it is,  and letting it dry before
removing the remaining film.  The stuff dries to a consistency not unlike
concrete, as you have discovered.


On the streaky wax syndrome:

BTDT,  and the issue may be the same as above.  Wax a smaller patch,  and
remove the haze as soon as it starts to dull.  If you do have streaks or
dark patches,  it's easy to go back over the same panel again with the wax,
buffing the haze as soon as it dries a little.

Several wax products I have recommend that the film be allowed to dry for 20
minutes or more before buffing the haze off.  This is a plot to sell more
wax,  since you will absolutely have to rewax to get an even shine.



I'm sure others spent an hour or two doing the wax-and-detail duty over the
weekend.  I was talking on the phone with a BMW-owning friend,  and casually
picked up a bottle and a towel to do a little detail cleaning.  Four hours
later I was just finishing up my ten-minute detail job.  Time machine
syndrome,  kinda like my first home computer.  Three black cars done this
weekend,  three others to go.
