Dear Friends:

This is an added note about that rattling sound coming from my engine. 
This is no longer a rattling sound, but a sound that is distinct like a
pulley squeeking and rattling as it turns.

At first I thought it may be just a bearing in the fan assembly, but I
now have the fan off and I cranked it up and it is still making that
noise.  It sounds like a pulley or wheel turning without oil. It squeeks
and rattles as it turns.

The sound is coming from behind the area beneath the water pump and near
the panels that cover what I think is the timing belt.  The engine only
has 102,000 miles on it, but is it possible that it is a bearing in
front of the crankshaft???  Perhaps a pulley bearing going bad??

Also when the engine is running, it idles fine with no problems, and I
put my hand on the engine and it doesn't skip at all, just this annoying
rattling sound. 

It seems to be coming from within the front of the engine....I am
totally stumped!  If this is a problem I can fix myself someone please
tell me, but if not then I think I will be taking it to the shop.

Mark
