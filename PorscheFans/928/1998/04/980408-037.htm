Well, the new tires are very cool.  Not too noisy, good looking and
sticky.  Got a deal on them too.  Thanks to Leonard L for the tire
pressure info.  Like I told him in another post I just had to take it on
a little "jaunt" on the way home from the office.  140mph is kind of
peaceful!  Esp. on new tires.  The vibration I had at 80mph is gone
too!  Anyway, nothing too interesting to tell - no problems, anyway. 
But, come to think of it, I have never really posted to the list with
any 928 problems.  I probably just jinxed myself though!      =)

Anyway, I guess the next list member to be my "victim" is going to be
Dave Ohlemacher.  He'll be visiting me this Friday to pick up -
(drumroll) - a Volkswagen Vanagon.  No, it isn't a 928, but he already
has one, and besides, he's making his wife drive the VW!  At least it's
German.  Anyway, I guess he'll get his choice of rides - 930 or S4.  He
may relay the experience when he gets back home.
Have a great rest of the day!
Brian Buxton
