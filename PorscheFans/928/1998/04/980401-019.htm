Ed,

I didn't think that you'd take my remarks seriously.  I never made a dime
in all the years I raced.  Did it for pure pleasure, just as you're doing.
Also, I was never seriously injured racing cars, although motorcycles,
hydroplanes, and hang gliders put a whole gang of oowees on my body.  

Racing as an amateur, don't try to win your first few races.  Try to hang
in behind the hot shoes and watch their moves till you start getting the
feel of it.  Even after that, a good way to approach it, is by driving as
slowly as you can to still be the first car across the line.  No race is
worth trashing your car over, even if you have a backer picking up the tab.

Have fun

Gene
