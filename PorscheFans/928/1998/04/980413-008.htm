Thanks to Mike McQuaid for purchasing the 1994 GTS that I posted inform=
ation
about - because I just purchased his 88 S4.  I even let my wife drive i=
t home
- didn't want to get any tickets on the first day.  She is now a fan - =
I was
wondering if she would actually stop.  Mike also agreed to keep me in m=
ind
for any future hand me downs.  Also since he wouldn't take my suggestio=
n
about keeping part of the 88 for fond memories (I tried to get him to s=
wap
the GTS's wheels) didn't work - so if anyone has a set of the GTS rims =
they
would like to sell let me know.
