Have not missed a posting for several months, and have learned a lot
here, especially from a few of you who seem to have an abundant
knowledge of 928s, so for you wizards out there, here goes.

I bought my 85 euro as if a demon was in control of my thought
process.  A recovered theft with dozens of small pieces and parts
missing. cats bypassed, no O2 sensor, etc.  Yes, It was relatively
cheap If it does indeed have 38K miles, as documented in the titles. 
Anyway here are my questions.  Assuming I need to add the cats (which
I have from an 86 32 valve machine)for emissions/inspection of out of
state car, Can anyone tell me where and how the air pump hooks to the
cat air input pipe.  I have the repair manual set, and the schematic
for the air pollution system shows the pump going thru a regulator,
then off to a check valve and into space.  I have therorally examined
the system, and after the regulator it goes to the air intake, and
hard piped into the back end of the heads.  I can not find any capped
line that could have ever gone to the cats.  I can not find any thing
in the repair manuals that indicates this plumbing to the back of the
heads even exists.  Is this something unique to European emissions
control's?  There is a "unleaded gas only" sticker on the instrument
cluster, which indicates to me that cats were installed at some point.
There is no hole in the passenger side floor for access to the O2
sensor as indicated in the repair manual. I have not found any wiring
(cut off or otherwise) that indicates that the O2 sensor ever existed
between the cats.  If there is another location for the O2 sensor, I
for the life of me can not find it.

For those of you who want to know how this mongrel runs, I'll just say
that it breathes easy and does have posi as the lines on my driveway
attest to.  

I have replaced most everything that was missing, and since I didn't
get any maintenance records with the car, I replaced the water pump
and timing belt.  The parts removed were in excellent condition, and
as you may have read, I now need a windshield for my efforts.

It is now time to get it on the road, and despite all I have learned
from this site and read in the manuals, I am stuck.  I plan to have
the emmissions tested soon to let me know where I am starting from.  

What do you think?  Can anyone out there (Leonard?) shed some light on
these problems?  I prefer the telephone to the telegraph, so If you
don't mind a call, E-mail me your phone number, and I will call you.

Thanks again,
Barry Williams
Old Lyme Ct.
