Excellent thought.  Check for leaks inside of car by
firewall/clutch pedal.  Sometimes leaks occur there
undetected until too late.  Carpet may even be soaked with
fluid and you wouldn't know it.

Another great reason to AX or at least prep like you do. 
Garage prep session, shake down runs and/or actual runs tell
almost all about car readiness.  I engage ABS about once a
month during clandestine drives to insure normal operation
valid.   How to not get dependent on ABS though?  Practice
threshold braking on other cars?

PSD gets worked out much more frequently  ;)
