Hello all.  I'm taking a break from recovering my steering wheel.  What a
drag!  This afternoon I recovered my auto shift handle, as um, sort of
practice for the steering wheel.  That was an ordeal in itself.  The leather
kit for the shift handle did not fit properly (it was too big) so I had to
trim it to fit as I stitched it together, along with repunching all of the
little holes for the thread.  I spent about 3 hours on the shift handle, but
it looks perfect.  If the steering wheel kit fitment is as bad as the shift
handle was, I will finish it in my next life.  If the steering wheel comes
out looking as good as the shift handle, I will forget the fact that it will
have taken all day tomorrow to finish.  At the point of this email I have
removed the airbag & steering wheel from the car and removed the old leather
as well.  I have stretched the new leather over the wheel and it seems to
fit better than the shift handle.  Had I known how time intensive this
particular project I would have gladly paid someone the $150 labor to do the
both.  But since I am such a perfectionist, maybe it is a good thing I'm
doing it myself.  oh well, back to stitching.  Happy sharking!
