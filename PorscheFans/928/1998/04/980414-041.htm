Altitude will effect nothing in a non presurized system like a hydrolic =

brake /clutch system.
the fluid is just their and as the presure drop is a miscule amount at 10=
k
feet, the only thing you =

would be effecting would be the fuel air mixture , which is computer
controlled to adjust to the =

35% reduction in air density.
If your pedal is going to the floor, you have some serious problem with y=
ou
brake /clutch line. (maybe a =

master or slave cylinder for the clutch is leaking.  )

anyway, I drive my 928 2 times a year hard (as it is a track racer for 10=

events a year) over the Sierras over a =

pass that is 9000 feet and then travel at 7500 feet for 2 hours , and
nothing changes!! (maybe a little less power)
So, get that hydr. system checked.  and certanly, the timing belt
tensioning system would more likely be effected by a solar flare than you=
r
little jount up to a 9000 ft. mountain.
