	When I changed my front shocks I got the new top ball joint boots and 
retaining rings at the Porsche dealer.  My dealer is also a Audi dealer!  
The audi 5000 parts worked fine.  He had to order them, they don't sell 
many audi 500 parts.

	432.407.377a boot

	431.407.384a

	431.407.383a retaining rings		Some say it's better to drop the lower arm 
to change the shock, I took out the top one.  Its not a easy job, but 
either way I recommend replacing that boot on the top arm.  The arm is a 
$400 part!  If the ball joint wears out that could get rather expensive, 
a little grease and a new boot can't hurt.  You could say Porsche should 
have made the ball joint replacable, but they rarely wear out.

	Once again there is a oil debate, why can't you go 25,000 miles on a 
synthetic.  If the viscosity doesn't change and if you still have 
detergent then why change the oil?  Change the fillter once in a while 
but the oil once a year.  Most sythetics will increase oil leaks, NEO oil 
will slow the leaks.  NEO will also supply test data, all oils have to go 
through the same tests, why don't they all give out the data?  At about 
$8 per quart it's not cheap but it's the best. At the end of a year it 
still is not dark on the dip stick, it's still not worn out.

	What is the detergent for, well have you ever seen water bead on the 
hood of a car? Well If you put some soap in the water it would not bead, 
it would wet the hood.  Thats what you want the oil to do.  NEO is the 
only oil I know of that has a DYESTER base stock, a natural detergent.  
Well now you can't run out of something if it's the base stock!

	All oils break down if to hot, NEO has the highest break down temp.  NEO 
also has the highest film strength, what is film strength?  Well think of 
the cam lobe pushing on the lifter, at some pressure the oil will no 
longer keep the parts seperated, thats film strength.
