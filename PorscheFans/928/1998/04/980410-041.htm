Some members asked about how to protect the
surface of polished alloy wheels and vaselene has
been suggested.  While there may be a place
some time for vaselene in my relationship with
my 928, this is not a marvelous wheel surface 
protectant.  Although it can theoretically capture
some energy from tiny brake dust embers, it can
also 
a) produce a dull finish, and doesn't harden
b) come off with a warm water wash 
c) form some streaks that can pick up dust.

I experimented and found good results with two
clear products.  One is Mother's detailer, in
pocket size spray.  The other is Armor Plate (from
the people who brought us stinky vinyl).  These
also protected my painted wheel centers (to
match the hood crest).  Carnuba wax might work,
too, but requires extra rubbing.  I had bad results
with clear coat Tremclad.  Fishoil also sucks.
