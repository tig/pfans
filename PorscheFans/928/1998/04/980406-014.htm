Hi All!!

Today (two days ago, actually) I found a vaccuum leak, in a weird spot, and I have to fabricate a spacer to cure it!  The aircleaner on a 16v bolts to a device with a flap in it, I will hereby refer to this device as the air-sensor.  This air-sensor pushes into a elbow pipe, and seals with an o-ring (a big one!) The only thing that holds this air-sensor aligned and in place is the two rubber topped intake manifold bolts that the aircleaner is bolted down with.  My air-sensor only engages this elbow by 1/4" or so... enough to barely squish the o-ring.  I feel that this leak would be lessened by getting the air-sensor to more fully engage this elbow. It could go in another 1/2" almost! I took off the aircleaner and ran the car with the air-sensor crammed home in the elbow, and the idle smoothed up and the revs _seemed_ happier.  I have to fabricate a aluminum spacer to go between the aircleaner, and the air-sensor, to push the device into the elbow better.... Doing that in the next couple of days, I'll keep the list posted on how it goes!!
Maybe this will cure my stumble!

Thanks for all the input!!

PS. I found fin marks on my keyboard yesterday, and a puddle in front of the desk. :)
