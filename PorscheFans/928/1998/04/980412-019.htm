Hi Rob,
The Mother's system is quite good but IMHO I think the Meguiars products
appear to have the edge. BTW use only the Meguirs "Mirror Glaze
professional" brand products - they also make a cheaper line for the DIY
automotive trade which is not as good a product imo. You can replicate the
Mother's three step system by using:

step one
Meguiars #9 Swirl Remover. This will take care of swirls and very faint
scratches.

step two
Meguiars #7 Glaze.  This is similar to the 3M glaze but not as greasy - You
will have to use the stuff sparingly and to buff it off fairly quickly,
otherwise you will encounter the same problem to get it off as you did with
the 3m glaze.  A lot of the concours guys stop at this step, but they use
the glaze as a final (unprotected) finish.

step three
Meguiars #26 Carnauba wax. It comes in paste and liquid form - I prefer the
paste.  It is IMHO the best wax for protection (longevity) and deep shine.
I have used Zymol, Autoglym, Mothers, Wax Shop, Griots and others,
including Meguiars own (very expensive) Medallion wax, but I always come
back to #26.

I have used the 3m with Meguiars #26 wax and did not have any compatibility
problems, but I now stick with the Meguiars #7 Glaze.

BTW, I do the three step process only once a year - strictly wax thereafter
- once a month or more.
