During this winter, I also experienced a few days where I had strong gas
smells in the car. After reading all of those posts about the Y connection
to the charcoal canister,
I decided to take a look today. Off came the wheel well liner and there it
was..or rather there they were: three hoses sticking out, each with a piece
of the y connector still attached. Being the impatient sort (and not wanting
to replace the part in another 10 years...) I purchased a stainless steel
substitute (intended to connect rubber gas lines to bunsen burners and the
like..) for $1. 
I would recommend anyone with a couple hours to spare to take a look under
there (actually took me 10 minutes to jack up the car, pull the
cover....then an hour to get the part....and another 25 minutes to install
and replace cover)

Happy driving!

p.s. Saw a gorgeous blue Aston Martin convertible while out in search of the
part... Not a 928, but still an interesting V-8 specimen!
