 This sounds like a restricted fuel-filter.  Accumulator wont cause this, 
as I run two CIS engines with no accumulator (racing conditions, too), 
with no lean-out problems.  Could be a failing pump, as Vince said.  My 
money is on the filter, or some other restriction.
 (Make sure your plugs are not fouled--had something similar to this one 
time.  Wires/coil/distributor OK?)
