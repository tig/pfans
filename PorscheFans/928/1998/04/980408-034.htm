It is triggered by the sensors on the underside of the 
master cylinder. It _could_ be a bad sensor, a poor
connection at the sensor or anywhere along that current
track, or it could mean that there's not enough brake
fluid pushing the sensor.

Check your fluid level.

Re-seat the electrical connectors of the pressure sensors by 
popping the rubber caps off, unplugging the electrical clips,
cleaning these contacts with ultra-fine emory cloth and/or 
electrical contact cleaning spray and re-assembling.

If the warning light is still on, are you sure that all
4 brakes are operating properly? 

The 83 is set up with a diagonal brake circuit division (RF & LR 
on one circuit and LF & RR on the other). This diagonal division 
will mask brake circuit failure to some degree. Therefore, if you 
have a bad master-cylinder, and either the front or rear chamber 
is not delivering full pressure, the car is designed to stop as 
evenly as possible under such conditions.  After doing some spirited
stops, walk around the car and carefully touch the brake disks. 
(CAREFULLY!)  Don't get burned! Are all four disks warm?
