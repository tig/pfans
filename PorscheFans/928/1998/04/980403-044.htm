i'd guess from the description that this one is totalled.
it sounds like the monocoque is bent, and that's going
to require some serious work with some serious equipment
to straighten out. the market value of a car this vintage 
is probably low enough that 10K to fix might start the ins.
co. to think about scrapping it.

good luck, and i hope i'm wrong!
