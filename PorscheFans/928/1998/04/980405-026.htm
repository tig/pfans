Hi Fellow Sharks, and their pilots...

My owner took me autocrossing today, and although he was a bit nervous,
I showed him how I can handle!!  He let me swim fast and furoius at the
Suntana raceway in Springville, Ut. in the "B" street prepared class,
and I had a blast!!  I swam the course 4 times, and although my tail was
a bit loose, I only squashed one cone, (with my right rear fluke of
course) and progressed from ~73 seconds to a best of 70.315.  This
raceway is a NASCAR sanctioned oval 4/10 mile around, with lots of
twisties/cones added, so my new 17" diameter fins helped lots!!  I
highly recommend that all you other sharks see if you can get your
owners to take you out race-swimming, it is very fun!

Kens Shark....

BTW (I got first place)((out of one))(((it was still great!)))
