Fellow Sharks and Sharkettes,

My driver side door look does not work correctly.  When I try to lock it it 
simply goes up and down a few times and stops.  It's as if it is trying to 
set itself against a stop that no longer exists.   When it is done you can 
still open the door.  It does however set the car alarm, as everyone at my 
office park can vouch now. :-).    Note: The car locks lock properly if I 
lock the car from the passenger side.

The PO had taken off the door panel to access an inoperative window motor. 
 After putting the panel back on I have a leftover philips head screw that 
I believe used to be in the door jamb near the lock area.

Can anyone assist me in putting this right?

BTW, I also have a mysterious piece of sheet metal left behind by the PO. 
It's about 8-10 inches by about 6-8.  It's cupped.  It kind of reminds me 
of the side covers of my old motorcyles.  There are two screw holes with 
threaded clips on the perimeter and a flange with a u shaped end on the   
backside that appears to be used to slide under a bolt to be tightened in 
place.

It thought it might be associated with the spare, jack and compressor but 
since the compressor and jack are mia I cannot figure it out.  Any ideas?

For all I know it could be a part of the driver side door...
