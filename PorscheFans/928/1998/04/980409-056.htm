Phil, I was just kidding about stuff falling off your studly steed( I felt
guilty later). These late models have more bells & whistles, ie: more stuff
to fail. Same with complicated airplanes or any other machinery. But
seriously, you've had more problems than should have occurred. I'm still
not convinced the 928 was really built to endure under lots of autocross,
drags, track, etc without excessive maintainance costs. But then what is.
Keep the flame going, you do a great job without complaining. Speaking of
flame, I'll get it for the above.

Best regards,

Del
