  I saw a few posts requesting info on how to replace coolant but didn't
  see any responses, so here's the procedure I followed a couple weeks ago.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

  What you'll need:  2 gallons of phosphate- and (preferrably silicate-)
  free antifreeze, 2 gallons of distilled water, (optional) Red Line Water
  Wetter, (optional) coolant system flush, socket wrenches, screwdriver, 
  garden hose and water supply.

  To drain the coolant, the engine must be cool.  Adding cool fluid to a hot
  engine can cause bad things can happen (e.g. cracking and warping).
  
  1. You should be able to remove the radiator drain plug without removing
     the pan that sits under the radiator.  On S4 and later models, remove 
     the full under-belly pan.
     
  2. Place a catch pan under the radiator drain plug on the passenger side
     of the radiator.  Remove the plastic plug with a screwdriver.  Allow
     all fluid to drain.  Approx 2 gallons will drain from the radiator.
     
  3. Draining the engine block is messy and it will be hard to catch all of
     the fluid, so work somewhere where you can afford to make a mess.
     There are two drain plugs on the engine.  These are located at the rear
     of the block on opposite sides just a couple of inches above the oil 
     pan mating surface.  The plugs are just bolts (14mm I think) that sit 
     horizontally in a casting that sticks out about an inch from the block.
     Remove each plug AND their corresponding crush washers and drain the
     fluid.  (Note: Sometimes the crush washers might stick to the block and
     then fall off into the fluid as it drains.  Just make sure you can account
     for them before putting everything back together.)
     
  4. While changing the fluid, I used the opportunity to run a flush through
     the cooling system.  This takes a while to do since you'll want to rinse
     the system two or three times to make sure all of the flush is out
     of there.  I used something by Prestone which called for running the 
     car with the heater on for ten minutes.  Remember to let everything cool 
     down before draining.  After the engine was cold, I drained the flush.  
     I then removed the upper radiator hose from the thermostat 
     housing, replaced all three drain plugs, and then used a garden hose to 
     fill both the radiator (through the radiator hose) and the engine block 
     (through the hole in the thermostat housing).  Remove all three drain 
     plugs to empty the system and then repeat the process a couple more times.
     Note that the car is NOT running while you do this!
     
  5. Replace the drain plugs.  Tightening the radiator plug until snug.  The
     block plugs are tightened to 33lb/ft, but I would be a bit conservative
     on that number.  Make sure you re-installed the crush washers!  Reattach 
     the upper radiator hose if you removed it. Fill the system through the 
     resevoir up by the firewall until the resevoir is full.  Turn on the car 
     and slide the ventilation control to the heater postion.  Add the 
     remainder of the four gallons of coolant and the Water Wetter.
     
  6. Devek stresses that all air must be removed from the cooling system.  To
     do this, you'll need to position the radiator higher than the engine by
     either jacking up the front of the car or by placing the car on a steep
     hill.  I loosened the small hose that runs from the resevoir to the top
     of the radiator at the radiator end and pulled it off just enough to 
     see air bubbles escaping without letting fluid leak out.
     
  7. Put on the radiator cap and take a test drive.  If you need more fluid,
     top it off with more distilled water.
