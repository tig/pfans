Oh man, we need to know where that smog shop is!  

The headers, well some know what they're looking at, others
have no clue.  At least the sorta resemble the stock shorty
headers.  The lack of a cat is an instant fail around these
parts (visual check).  If the tech missed that, then he/she
wouldn't have enough sense to note the lack of an airpump
tube neither (another visual).  Yes shops are uptight here
in the city, and every item is checked out ie. EGR, test
vacuum signal, initial timing, blah lah lah - by the book. 
The smog shop would rather issue a fail ($19.95
ca-ching...NEXT) and send you off to the referee station
than have to work on an exotic car (ill-prepared) or worse
be hit with substantial fines ($1,000s & loss of license for
repeat offenses).  

Since we know the car passes without the cat (how close to
allowable?) what's to prevent one from fashioning a
reasonable looking faux cat shell around the bypass to have
their cake and eat it too?  A preliminary non-reporting smog
check would then show yay or nay.  Not that I'm recommending
any of this mind you!  Nooooo....

I hope CARB never joins with the IRS or else we'll all have
to move!?!
