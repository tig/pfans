Yea!! The '87 S4 5-speed passed it's emissions test today!!! 

I told myself I wasn't going to watch this horrible invasion, but when
my daughter asked me if that man was going to fit into the car, I had to
look. The test was over with quickly because the car was in good shape
and only had to endure one cycle. Now all I have to wait for is next
Thursday when the beast goes for its doctor's visit.

I got my custom plates ordered too.   87 SHARK    Should have them in a
week. I wanted  LNDSHRK  but it was taken already. I just hope a 928 has
them.

Anyone (Leonard??) want to clue me in about gas tank vents? I'm going to
guess that my idle problem is gas tank related (filter/vents). Anyone
else have a "vent" story??

Thanks...
