Several weeks ago I had an incedent where I had no brakes at highway speeds.
The pedal went to the floor with no affect. (other than spuring my adrenal
gland into action!)  I replaced the master cylinder, as after getting the
car stopped, the pedal still went to the floor but I could stop the car at
10 to 15 miles per hour with more effort needed than normal.  I have to add
that when the brakes had failed, I had been through some quite heavy use in
rush hour traffic.  Today the same thing happened, (after heavy stop and go
traffic)at about 40 mph coming up on a stop light that had just turned red.
As last time I used the ebrake to slow the car and used it to limp the two
blocks home.  As I walked by the front wheel on the drivers side of the car
to open the hood, I felt heat radiating from the wheel.  I checked the other
side. it was cool to the touch, while the other one was still too hot to
touch after 30 minutes! I poped the hood, and htere was brake fluid on the
top of the mastercylinder resevoir cap. (there are breather holes)  Now here
is where the question is.  An hour after this incedent, I decided to test
the brakes in the parking lot....  Now I have full brakes.  However the Left
front wheel is hot enough to cook on....  the car does not pull to the left.
What am I looking at?  I'm pretty sure that a new Factory Porsche master
cylinder didn't fail and then get better.  O I am looking at the caliper is
just sticking and caused the brake fluid to boil, causing bubbles in the
line and no brakes, or the worse of the two, my antilock module is going
out.  On the S4 the Master Cylinder only has two outputs on it I'm not sure
which combo, right & left, or front & rear, both go into the Antilock module
then on to the calipers...   I need to get this cleared up as soon as
possible.   The other possibility is that maybe one of the antilock sensors
on one side is inop.....
