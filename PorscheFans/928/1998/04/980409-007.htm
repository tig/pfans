I saw a few postings about your dilemna, so here's my .02

My 79 odo got Alzheimer's after replacing dash and pod.  It measured
about 1/5 actual mileage.   Also, the speedo will quit working after
about 45 minutes continuous driving.

The VDO setup is notorious for the small plastic odo gears becoming
brittle and breaking.   I checked with Palo Alto Speedometer
(650-323-0243) which is a VDO factory service designate.   I also
checked with 928 International for a used unit, and the prices were
about the same for repair vs replace.   I elected to have the unit
repaired figuring newer gears should last longer.   According to Helmut
(Palo Alto Speedo), the little repair gears from VDO have recently been
discontinued!   They are exploring alternatives, but still have an
inventory to work from for awhile.   While they were in there, I
estimated what proper mileage should be for my car and had them 'scroll
up' the reading to keep everything as close to 'proper' as possible.
They did fine work, and have a one-day turnaround on repairs (already
out of car clusters, of course).  They use a heat lamp to check for
electronic malfunctions, and found none.   Their suggestion is to go to
the sender in the tranny as the likely culprit for the speedo
problem.    Haven't done it yet, but I'll get to that part soon.

Hope this helps.
