Well, I took my 83 928S for its first road trip.  I was travelling from DC 
to Cumberland Maryland to visit my folks with my 7 year old son when out of 
the blue the engine just shut off.  If you turned the key over to the crank 
position, the engine would start and then immediatly shut back down.  None 
of the dash lights would come on and you couldn't hear the fuel pump.  I 
managed to get a hold of one of my friends who came and got us and dropped 
us off at my house.  I called the Porsche dealer in DC who said it sounded 
like the ignition switch went bad.  After a $225 towing bill, the car is 
waiting to get into the shop.  Anyone else ever experience a problem like 
this?

Did they ever make performance chips for the 928?
