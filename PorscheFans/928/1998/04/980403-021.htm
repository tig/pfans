Hi all,

I have owned my White 89 S4 with 17" Carrera cups and GTS arches for a =
couple of weeks now and I'm still getting used to driving it, I haven't =
owned a rear wheel drive car before, let alone a car this powerful, it's =
fantastic fun.

The straight line acceleration is amazing, but it's the cornering I'm =
working on, I've had the tail out a few times when being aggressive with =
it, but it will quickly get back in line again.

1. Suspension
When making quick direction changes, I feel the suspension is a little =
soft, I can feel the weight shift and it seems to take a few moments to =
settle into the bend and feel solid. I can also feel the rear shifting a =
little if I lift off a bit in a bend. I'm wondering if it has something =
to do with the Weissach rear suspension, perhaps the wider wheels and =
offsets are affecting it or is this normal.

Comments please?

Has anyone got recommendations on stiffening the suspension?

2. Noisy tappets.
I didn't notice any tappet noise before I bought the car, probably =
because on the occasions that I looked at it, the engine was fairly =
warm. Now I am getting tappet noise every time I start the engine when =
it's cold, the tappets go quite after 2 or 3 minutes driving.

The car has just had an oil change, with "Comma" fully synthetic oil, =
the oil is at the maximum mark and the pressure gauge is at maximum on =
startup and drops to 2 bar at idle when fully warmed up.

Does anyone else experience the same problem with noisy tappets and know =
of a way to quieten them when cold?

I have considered using an engine flushing oil, in the hope that it =
might clean out some oil ways. I have used flushing oil before in a 10 =
year old Audi and afterwards it had a leak in a crankshaft seal, which I =
then replaced. I believe the engine in my 928 had a rebuild four years =
ago, so I'm hoping that the seals are still good.

Comments please?

Thanks in advance,

Nigel Hooker,

White 89 S4 5sp, GTS look.
