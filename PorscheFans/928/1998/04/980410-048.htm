I read the article where Mark states...
" The drive shaft can twist one and a half to two rotations  of twist =
when torquing up"
A typical statistic which didn't surprise me any.

Reminds me of the example one of my professors used about the drilling =
rig he worked on in his younger years, and the number of revolutions the =
drill went through before the bit even began to turn at the bottom.

I don't have my references here, but as David Kelly said, there is a =
simple formula for figuring this out.  I believe the only variables are =
material, shape and size, and the amount of torsional stress applied.  =
Obviously different materials have different properties, and some steel =
shafts -would- stay twisted like a candy cane after being subjected to =
the kinds of stresses the 928 generates.  We just have to accept that =
Porsche did their homework on this one and chose a material with elastic =
properties capable of rotating 1.5-2 times with little or no plastic =
deformation. =20
And yes I am the  graduate of a mechanical engineering program. :-)
