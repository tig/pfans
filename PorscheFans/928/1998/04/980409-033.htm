I have been measuring ride hight for longer than anyone, and here is the
bottom line.
get a level out and stick it in the door jam. should be ever so slightly
pointing down hill  (nose down)
if you do that everything should be very close.   verified by corner
balencing and measuring the ride hight at the spec points which are at th=
e
rear cross member (couple of very small machined pads) in the front  at t=
he
lower control arm at the rear bushing.  I measured about 5 inches at the
front, and 5.5 inches at the rear.   (mine is set up for the track though=

and is a little low, but not slammed)    fenders are at 23 rear and  25
front. exactly,   as there should be a 2" difference between front and
rear.    If your front fender is at 24.25, it is like mine when I first
lowered it and I was hitting my headers on every speed bump in town.( =

stock is around 23.75 and 25.5)  Is your fender hight lower than  your ti=

hight.  (one finger should be about right and that equates to about 25" o=

the fender.( based on a 24.5 tire hight)  225x50 16 or 225x45 17.
Very interested in everyones ride hight myself.  =

Everyone should post their ride hight at the fender and any corner
balencing results. =

Mine weighed out at 3334 and and was about 850 a corner ave empty.  ( the=

lightest wheel was the passenger front, at 750 ironically was the lowest
point too.   figure that one out.    )

Mark
84 928 headers suspension, R1s Loud, and passed smog with a bypass tube =

before the headers were put on.
Trying to find a false cover to visually fake out the smog guy.  Race
exhaust 3.5" tube is a little obvious.
