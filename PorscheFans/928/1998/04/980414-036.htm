Hello all,
This was originated by a guy on the Ferrari owners list, but I saw this
post on the 911 list and thought it was neat enough to re-post here. 
It's long but good.  Maybe I'm just a "nerd" though, as some 911 listers
were making fun of this guy.  Oh well.  Now everyone raise your right
hand and repeat after me...

My personal code of conduct as an exotic owner:

1) My cars will always be clean and well-presentable. I will ensure that
my cars are in the highest state of mechanical condition and
maintenance.  Exotics are rare, and to see one is a special experience. 
I have an
obligation to present these cars to others at a high standard.

2)  I will always be polite, courteous, and friendly.  I will not talk
down to or ignore anyone, and I will cheerfully answer all questions. 
Exotic owners wrongly suffer from a "snob" label.  By actively and
always countering this, I will strive to change this perception among
all whom I meet.

3) Where feasible, I will encourage inspection and observation of my
cars.  If someone is clean and courteous, I will encourage them to sit
in my cars.  I will actively encourage photographs.  In-particular, I
will encourage this especially among younger children.  On occasion, I
will offer rides to admirers, under the appropriate circumstances.

4) With one exception (see 5, below), I will obey all traffic laws or
local traffic customs.  Especially, I will pass other cars only in
marked, safe passing zones, and I will always respect traffic speeds and
noise ordinances within city limits.  I will always drive in a defensive
manner to protect myself and my vehicle.  I will not initiate nor will I
respond to challenges to race my cars on open public roads.  When asked
to race, I will positively comment on the challengers car and invite
them to inspect mine at an appropriate stopping point, while asking if I
might see their vehicle.

5) Operating my cars as God, Ferry, Enzo, and Ferruccio intended will
occur only on open, rural routes free of heavy traffic or on
appropriately designated
race courses.  On public highways, I will use my highest powers of
observation and diligence to ensure that I place myself, my vehicles,
and
the public in no additional danger.  I will be aware of the environment
and road conditions, and I will not drive at excessive speeds on unknown
or suspect roads.  When approaching blind corners or hills, I will
assume that
an obstacle exists and will take appropriate defensive measures. 

6) I will share my passion and excitement for exotic cars with others
through community service and charitable events.  I will actively seek
out community organizations such as local police departments and schools
and offer my cars for use in events such as DARE programs, homecoming
parades,
pep rallies, etc.  Many communities have "Make a Wish" foundations for
sick
children.  If given the opportunity, I will offer a day with myself and
my cars to such organizations in an effort to brighten an otherwise
trying life for someone less fortunate than I.

7) I will be honest and open with other enthusiasts, and I will
accurately represent my cars to prospective owners and buyers.  I will
keep complete
records, and I will always follow-up with purchasers of my cars to
ensure
that they continue to gain maximum satisfaction and appreciation for
cars
that I have owned and serviced.

8) I will always have a smile on my face when inspecting, driving, or
showing my cars to others, and I will never forget how fortunate I've
been to own such automobiles.  I will constantly remind myself that the
future is uncertain, and that today may be as good as it gets!

Best!
Brian Buxton
