Glenn,

If you are running so rich that you are drowning your spark plugs, you might
analyze why this might happen.   The usual culprit is failure of the head
temperature sensor, the primary DME input for fuel mixture.   If it tells the
engine that it is colder than it really is, the DME will respond with a very
rich mixture which will foul the plugs in very short order.
