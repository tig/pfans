I didn't get the List one day last week, like, apparently, many of you.
Since then, I've been getting each day's List 24 hours later than
before. It doesn't really matter if everyone is also receiving it this
way. Question is: Are you? 

Right now, its 5:30 pm on the 18th (in California) and I've got the List
for the 17th. At this very moment, is it possible that anyone (perhaps
other than the Listmaster) could have received today's List? Is this a
new policy?
