Tamers,

I just got the shark back from the shop (new injectors), and I now seem
to be having a little problem with the oil pressure. When I've been
running for a little while, the oil pressure goes down  to about 2 on
the guage; consequently, the car runs very hot. In Miami, it is bound to
get hotter than hot. It runs almost to 3/4 on the heat guage, which
normally it does not do. When I step on the pedal, it gets up to 3-1/2
to 4. This is still not right, I believe. The only way it gets up to 5
is in the expressway, and then when I get off of it, it goes back down
to 2 and quickly heats up. Is there anything that anyone recommends for
this type of thing?

Thanx in advance,
jojo712@gate.net
