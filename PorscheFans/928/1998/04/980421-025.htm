I've noticed the posts on air conditioning are starting to appear again. 
Just as one might expect as the weather warms up a bit in the northern 
hemisphere. I was talking to a guy at the weekend who really knows this 
stuff. He asked me what year my 928 was and then proceeded to tell me, 
from memory, the manufacturer and model number of the compressor and told 
me how rugged it was etc etc. I checked later and he was exactly correct. 
Scary. Anyway he had a couple of comments that I thought were interesting 
enough to share. He talked about converting to R134 and said that there 
was a new oil out that you simply add to the system after removing the 
R12 and then all you need do is recharge with R134. No need to flush or 
even remove the old oil. Sounds a little to good to be true but like I 
said he really knew his stuff and said he had used it in a lot of 
Porsches including his own not to mention other less interesting 
vehicles. He also mentioned a simple modification to improve the 928 air 
conditioning system. Unlike just about every other car in the visible 
universe, the electric fan on the 928 doesn't kick in as soon as the air 
is turned on. It starts when the compressed refrigerant gets above a 
certain temperature. He suggested that wiring in a relay to give more 
conventional operation would help a great deal. Sound simple enough to 
do. I think I'll wire mine up so that the fan runs at low speed as soon 
as the air is turned on and let the refrigerant temperature sensor turn 
the wick up when needed. Anyone tried this already?
