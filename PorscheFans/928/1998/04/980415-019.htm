John,
Make sure you get a engine for the correct transmission.
Also if you get a later engine be sure to get the wiring harnesses and the
brains, they are different from year to year. This will make your swap much
easier and trouble free.
For example the early 87 engines have a different engine harness that the
late 87, etc., etc.

Do your homework on the correct engine type and make sure who ever you deal
with is reputable, honorable and is willing to take it back if it is
defective in any way.

Here are a few recommendations, Devek, 928 International, P.A.P..
I am sure there are a few others, but do not be tempted to save a few
hundred dollars on your investment by getting an engine from someone without
checking into their references and return policies.
