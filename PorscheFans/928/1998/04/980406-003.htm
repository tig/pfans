The shark went in to see the Porsche man today to have a minor bit of
bodywork done and have a full suspension geometry work-up as the
camber is out on the left front wheel. I was aware that the steering was
slightly vague, but at anything approaching legal speeds, and for
non-track use, it's fine. 

I got a call from the garage to go over the quotes for the work, and in
passing he mentioned that the rack had too much play in it (which would
explain the slightly vague steering). He had costed up a "new" rack for
me - Porsche reconditioned and supplied - at 1,100 pounds plus VAT and
labour. OUCH. 

Since Devek quote _factory_ recon racks at only $800 (500 pounds)
there is a huge margin being made by someone somewhere along the
line....Just a shame that Devek almost certainly don't stock RHD steering
racks, although I've emailed them just in case..... Out of curiosity, I'm
getting a quote to have the existing rack reconditioned, to see if it's worth
getting done anytime soon.

It's a continual learning process, guys. At least we get to know more
about the nice complicated insides of our beasts.
