Sam, 
Looks like some unwanted air is getting into your intake manifold, i.e you
have a leak somewhere.
The Bosch injection system on your car adjusts idle automatically (in fact
there is a small servo that perform this function on the throttle body) ), but
it does it correctly as long as the LH unit (the so called Hot wire air flow
measurement unit)  sees ALL the air going through the intake. 

If you have any leak around the intake system,  it will  affect your idle.

 If too much air is coming in UNDETECTED by the flow meter,  the Control unit
will produce the wrong mixture (too lean) and your engine will slow down.
Then the control unit  will detect a low RPM, and will tell the servo to open
the throttle a bit.
The engine will accelerate, pump a little more air through the unwanted leak
and you'll have your lean mixture again and so on...which explains the uneven
idle phenomenon you notice. 
If the leak is significant, it may even affect your economy and driveability.
Noticed any change in economy lately?

Someone suggested to use butane to detect the leak...looks easy at first
glance, but I would certainly recommend NOT to do that (please no flame,
literally!) ...this is pretty dangerous, and frankly could be quite inacurate!

What I suggest requires a little more work, but it is safer!
You should first remove your filter housing , then block the intake of the air
flow sensor with a piece of neoprene (piece of an old inner tube for example)
or similar and a hose clamp. (Be VERY careful not to introduce any object in
the flow meter: the wires are VERY fine , and cannot be repaired.. and this is
an expensive component!!) 

Disconnect the vacuum tube from the brake booster, and start pumping some air
in the intake manifold from there..(Don't start the engine!!) 

You may hear some leaking air already!!

Spray soapy water from a spray bottle around the hoses, connections and
gaskets around the intake plenum. Look for these bubbles!

Suspect the various hoses for vacuum etc. around the manifold first, but it is
not impossible that the gaskets between the plenum and the heads are the
culprits.

You may be lucky and only have to re-torque  the studs...but the gaskets are
likely to be the problem. (vibrations and temperature cycles tend to get the
best of them!) 

If it's there, the key to succes is replacing with new gaskets (relatively
cheap!)  and proper re-install of the manifold and  accurate torquing
sequence!!

I don't have the data here with me, but if you need  that particular piece of
information, I'll be glad to forward it to you.

Good (leak) hunting. It is a somewhat tedious process, but with great rewards!
It is also a very necessary skill for any shark owner!
