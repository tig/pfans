<< I also have this problem where the indicator light comes on when I'm
 holding down the
 brake pedal for over a few seconds. Is the problem in the dash pod?
 Thanks,

Lou,
Sounds like a bad bulb to me, but I figure you've checked that and your fuse
already.
It takes a few seconds for the bulb check unit to recognize a problem.
I don't think the problem would be in your dash. Also, check your brake light
switch (under the brake pedal) to be sure it is operating.....That was my
problem. 
Don't assume it's something complicated, as it's likely a bulb, fuse, bad
connection at the lights, or something mechanical like the brake switch. (as
it is the main wear component of the system)  I must confess, I thought the
worst at first..... (after determining that the fuse and bulbs were good)
...... like a bad bulb check unit or even a faulty central warning system unit,
but don't start ripping out wires till you've thoroughly checked the obvious. 
Hope this helps,
Greg S.
