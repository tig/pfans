	Hello Thawing Sharks!!
	[snip]
	and was doing some high rpm 1-2-3 runs when <thunk-a-thunk-a-thunk> the
	driveline said!!  It made this noise because the engine was missing then
	running then missing then (you get the pic)  So here is my question!!
	What could cause the 16v motor to stumble and cough badly after a
	5500-6000 blast through three gears, but idle great.  The problem clears
	itself up after only a minute or so, but there is no way I'll let my
	shark cough like that in front of people at the AX!!!  BTW, I have put
	new gas in and checked timing and verified the t-belt tension (slippage
	fear) Here is the wierd part... This is repeatable!! If I get frisky and
	take 1st to 5800, 2nd to same, you can bet that by 5000-5500 in third
	the bucking and surging, coughing fit WILL happen (sometimes not)
	I know this post is a punctuation/phrasing felony, but I still am upset
	that my pet might be sick...

	Thanks

	I would check the fuel pump to see if pressure is within spec.  Is an '80 CIS?  If
so, then you'll have two pumps, one at the tank, the other inside the rear right wheel
well.  You might have a collapsed fuel accumulator.  Though hard starting will be  a
symptom.
