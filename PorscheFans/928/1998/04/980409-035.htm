I did a little research on this issue as I have" Her Royal Highness The
Princess Alyssa Raquel" to chauffeur on occasion. I called DEVEK and foun=
d
out that Porsche actually makes a car seat that will fit specifically in
our cars with the P logo and teddy bears.  However, being the cheap cuss
that I am, I refused to pay 175.00 for a logo and teddy bears.  I instead=

visited several baby stores and after trying several, found that any car
seat WITHOUT a base will fit perfectly in the rear.  At Toy's R Us,  I
purchased a Century, with a 5 point harness for the Princess that matches=

my interior.  I spent a whopping $65.00 because I had a coupon. Good
hunting and realize that everything new on the market is DOT approved.
