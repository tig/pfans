Hello eveyone,

	I think I might have found a 928S4 that I might consider buying. It is a 
1988 model 100K blue/tan, A/T, + many other options. the car had a rear end 
incident, and the read bumper cover was repainted (very lousy job). I would 
consider replacing it and repainting it and the front bumper cover. the dash has 
some cracks, and in the trunk, the left side leather needs to be fixed. Radio 
doesn't really work. The owner is asking $15900, i think it is too much for its 
shape... how much do you think it is worth?
	Also, does anyone know of any good 928 mechanics in Charlotte, NC or its 
surrounding areas?
	I appreciate you help.
	
Khaled
