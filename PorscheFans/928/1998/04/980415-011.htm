P-fans,
A friend sent me this joke and I just had to pass it on.;-)

> A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse falls into a mud
>> hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to
>> help pull him out safely. The chicken runs to find the farmer, but the
>> farmer can't be found. So the chicken drives the farmer's Porsche 911
back to
>> the mud hole and ties some rope around and drives forward saving him from
>> sinking.
>>
>> A few days later the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow again
>> and this time the chicken fell into the mud hole. The chicken yelled to
>> the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, "I
>> think I can stand over the hole!" So the horse stretched over the width
>of
>> the mud hole and said, "Grab my "thingy" and pull yourself up." The
>> chicken did and pulled himself to safety.
>>
>> The moral of the story:
>> If you are hung like a horse, you don't need a Porsche 911 to pick up
chicks.
>>
