Phil, maybe I misunderstood, but a recent post sounded like you were
looking for the alarm control unit. If that's correct, the letters below
from PCNA may help.

RE:	WP0AA2925MS810347

Dear Mr. Lisk:

We are in receipt of your letter dated January 14, 1998 concerning the
difficulties with the interior lights of your
1991 928 GT.

According to my Technical Service department, there was a change in the
alarm system that model year which effects some of the other electrical
systems including the interior lights.  Enclosed are copies of two pages
from a Service Manual listing the functions which are included in the alarm
control unit.(which is located beneath the right hand seat)

Sincerely,

Susan Elbe
Customer Commitment Representative


The basic functions are for the most part the same as in the old alarm system.
For easier comprehension, the description is divided up into the following
functional Units:
-	Function of alarm system
-	Switching off alarm system
-	System readiness indication
-	Alarm triggering
-	Type of alarm
-	Anti-theft feature
-	Faults
-	Central locking
-	Interior light delay
-	Diagnosis
-	Country coding
-	Connecting additional Systems
-	Connector assignment
-	Block diagram
