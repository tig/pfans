Thanks for all the answers.
A couple of questions though:
1.  How did you mount the smaller vw battery  (ie battery goes in and you=

wedge a piece of wood , or strap it down)
2.  when you disconnected the fan and belt, did you have to run the
electric fan in front of the a/c or install a new fan running inplace of
the driven fan .   7 hp ?????wow , thats a lot of power.   If you drive a=

electric fan to the same air flow, the altinator will have to produce the=

electricity to drive the electric fan and the drag on the altinator will =
be
the same. =

The power has to come from somewhere!!    Question is , is the 928 coolin=
g
system enought to cool the engine in a =

track environment as my temp never gets over dead even normal , ever.  =

even when I had a clogged radiator, it never got over normal .  (until I
stopped and idled for 1 or 2 min, then it shot up)
3.  What did you do to get your beast down to 3150    (big diet)
4.   Does that air pump drive any other vacumme driven functions on the 9=
28
engine.  (besides the cat )  Would you remove the air pump after you pass=
ed
smog?
5.   You said the europe version had more displacement.  it that true.  I=

thought it was just the items you mentioned too.
(glad to hear injection is reletively the same whether or not euro)  but
valves , ports , runners,no cat , and lets not forget higher compression!=
!!
Thanks for the imput in advance.
