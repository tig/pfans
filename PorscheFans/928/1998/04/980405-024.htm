Hi all,
Well, today started out pretty good......3M Imperial Hand Glazed and waxed...
(Zymol as always) Supercar looks great. 
My car has been good to me as far as niggling electrical problems go, but it
seems I have either aquired my first glitch, or I have a failed component.
I noticed yesterday my "stop lamp" instrument bulb staying on even after the
first brake application, and then subsequently going out a few miles down the
road. Today it did the same thing once and then later the "stop lamp" bulb
came on and has stayed on. When it came on while moving the "central warning
light" also came on, but when the "stop lamp" remained on after startup and
first brake application, the "central warning light" was not lit. I checked
all the bulbs and they are ok, however, none of the brake lights come on when
brakes are applied. Fuse is also ok. Checked for voltage at the fuse and have
none. I also have no voltage at the brake pedal switch. Manuals seem to point
me to a possible defective bulb check unit or central warning unit. The
manuals also show an adapter to bridge the connections on the bulb check unit
so that you can have operating brake lights in an emergency. (on page 90-39 of
the Body/Electrics book) Does anyone happen to know which connections should
be bridged? I figure if I can bridge these and the brake lights work, then I
will know that the bulb check unit is defective.
Any other thoughts? .....(I find myself wishing I was a little more adept at
using the wiring diagrams in the manuals......perhaps when I meet one of you
guys with more knowledge in that area, you could give me a little training?)

Best to all,
Greg Schickel
