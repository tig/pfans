The coil takes 12 volts at high current (that external resistor limits 
current) on the primary side, and converts it to 20,000 volts on the 
secondary side (low current, but it will wake you up). It does this by 
having a proportionately larger number of loops (of thinner wire) on the 
secondary (high voltage) side, resulting in a much larger DC resistance.

No, this doesn't make any sense to me either.  The
second part of the test should be to check from either
of the outside terminals (primary) to the inner one
(the secondary).  I would check both.  This resistance
should be much higher I believe.

Someone else will have to help with the specifics.
Maybe someone at home today could check one that's 'on
the bench'.  I think you should check with wires
disconnected.  Plus, you probably have other automotive
coils around.  Check one of those.  All coils operate
by the same principal and will have similar readings.
