<< I have condensation droplets in my taillight lens on an S4. How do you get
rid of it? I removed the lens, but it appears to be between layers of plastic,
so I can't reach it through the socket holes. Can it be baked at low temp to
evporate the moisture out?>>
 
 I had the same problem with mine (in the headlights too!) 
The solution was in two steps:

1) I took the assembly off the car, and used a blow dryer on low setting on
the outside surface, in order to evaporate and dry the inside. 
I left the parts inside the house for a night (on one of the house heater's
vents!!) , to make sure all the moisture was gone and the inside perfectly dry

2) Carefully look for small cracks or gaps, especially where two different
materials meet (e.g. the lens and the reflector for the headlights) and (if
you can find it!) reseal with a derivative of Super Glue called "Zap-A-Gap",
used sparingly. It is invisble if used properly.

Maybe not an official procedure from the 9 volumes Porsche shop manual...but
if they don't talk about, one has to improvise!

Even with El Nino around in CA , I haven't noticed any recurrence of the
problem (The car is a daily commuter: 200 miles/day)
