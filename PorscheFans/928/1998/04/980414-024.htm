I have a 1983 S.  It is light Blue metallic.  I have had it for a while and
have noticed that I have SOMEHOW gotten a very faint spray of paint on it.
ALL OF IT !  It isn't noticeable to the eye, but the car has a very light
sandpaper texture to it.  I thought it was a bad paint job at first, but a
review of the glass on the car shows the same thing.  My suspicion is I was
parked in the wrong place at the wrong time, as spray painting was going on.

Assuming that the auto finish is stronger than the "new" paint, can anyone
recommend a product and procedure to remove it? I have tried waxes and
buffing compounds, and these really didn't cut it.  I used a rotary buffer
with some generic "once-a-year-car-polish" as well.  All I got from that was
swirl marks.

Please reply to the list, and CC me as well at stevepeck@viperlink.net .  I
don't always have the time to read the digest.

Many thanks in advance.
-Steve
