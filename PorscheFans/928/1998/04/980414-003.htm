Maybe I shouldn't bother the whole list with this
note, but it could be that others with cars on the
1981-82 fence have wondered about this.  I have
not been able to find an answer to a question
concerning what is a 928 and what is a 928 S in
1981, for sure.  Although it is obvious after 1982,
it is not so clear that my 1981 is an S (but see
928S4vr comment below).  My 928  is loaded
with all the options of the competition package,
etc.  It was sold to me as an S, but they hadn't
started putting S on the body (e.g., horn).  I can't
find anything that this car didn't come with.  At
www.928s4vr.com/928s4003.htm (with a photo
basically identical to mine), Phil says "Though not
officially monikered a 928 S by the factory,
enough of the goodies werer present for it's
inclusion here."  So, can I tell myself I have an S
or not, even though it is just a loaded 4.5-L?
