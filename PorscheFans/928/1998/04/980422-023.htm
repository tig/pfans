Tough question:



What is the range of resistance that the outside
air temp sensor swings through? 

My sensor is missing from my 84. I'm hoping to
just trouble-shoot other problems with the AC by
rigging a potentiometer in place of the sensor.

See, the 84 also experiences the "cruise control /
AC inoperative" problem (which is often a result of
a vacuum leak). Trouble-shooting this only becomes
complicated by the outside temp sensor missing.

The AC button engages the compressor, but no cold
air is produced. Yes, it might be due to a leak in
my refrigerant loop, but the fact that this car
_also_ has the cruise control problem points to a
vacuum leak. Besides, the system was recharged just
before I bought the car (have receipt) and the AC
has never worked since the day I test drove the car.
Oh yeah, the mechanic that recharged it is good. The
PO told me that the AC worked well for a while after 
it was recharged. I'd guess that a vacuum leak developed
sometime after that recharge.

The cruise control grabs the pedal and accelerates
the car, as long as I continue to pull back on the
lever to activate it. But, as soon as I release this
lever, there is nary a hint of cruise control engaged.

So, back to my question at the top; what is the range
of resistance of the outside air temperature sensor?
Or, what is the resistance of this sensor on YOUR CAR,
RIGHT NOW.

BTW - I have the wiring diagrams. These don't provide
specific details for any of the sensors. Just the basics
of what wires are connected. I'm pretty sure that the
only way to answer my question is for someone with a
sensor to take a multimeter, unplug the sensor and get
a reading. That won't give me a range, but I can happily
work with just this single measurement.

David Roberts or Mark Anderson or anyone else with the part 
out of the car...this would be very easy to measure and pass on.

TIA,
