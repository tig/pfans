Hi Jacques

Do you mean that you managed to pressurize the intake manifold? This 
sounds like a really neat approach. I would have thought that at least 
one intake valve would be open and because of cam overlap an open exhaust 
valve also. This would make it tough to build any pressure. What am I 
missing?

I can certainly confirm your caution on the MAF sensor. After checking 
just about everything else, that's what I needed to fix my cold start/ 
rough idle problems last year. Can$1000.00 ($700 in real money) for that 
thing. I decided to vent  $1000.00 of annoyance on the dead one by 
pulling it to pieces and yes that wire is delicate. Takes about six or 
seven volts to make it glow red hot and melt in case anyone cares. I was 
curious about the self cleaning cycle these things go through by the way, 
my vengeful streak is not that deep! Actually, one indicator of a dead 
MAF sensor is the lack of this cleaning cycle. The wire should glow for a 
second or two a few seconds (5 or 6 I think) after the engine is turned 
off. The MAF sensor should have a wire screen on each end that offers 
some protection by the way.
