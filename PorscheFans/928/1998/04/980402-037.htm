I took a chance and polished the heck out of
mine with Mother's Aluminum Polish (cream
stuff) and a motorized buffing machine (the slow
kind of waz applicatior that you aren't suppose to
use for waxing, not the grinder or drill kind). 
They look great and all you need them is a
5-minue MAP buffing by hand once ever 2
months.

  The owners manual for my '83 recommends an
occasional coating of 
  petroleum jelly (i.e. Vaseline)!  It doesn't last all
that long, but
  it makes a nice difference for a while.
