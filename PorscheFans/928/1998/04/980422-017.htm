David, a thousand bucks a year is not much at all.  Any older BMW,
Mercedes, Porsche or other interesting car can easily cost much more. 
Actually regular boring cars can easily cost more than that.  Some years
nothing may break, other years a lot.  Unfortunately no crystal ball is
available to tell you which cars will be cheapest.  One idea is to have
an econobox for the daily commute and something nice in the garage for
the weekends.  Keep in mind the 928 was very expensive when new (94
model $95,000) and parts are priced accordingly.  Hell I spent over
fifteen grand on my early 80's Nissan 280ZX that was the nicest I could
find to start with, but I also drove it a hundred thousand miles and am
a nut for gleaming spectacular condition. 

(David wrote)  Point blank, my nick name is not "money-bags" and I don't
want a car that will require $1,000/year (especially beyond standard
maintenance).
