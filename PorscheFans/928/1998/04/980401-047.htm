This is my first post to the list so bear with me.  I have been on the 
list for a couple of weeks and I must say that its great, I'm learning 
heaps every day.  

If everything goes to plan, tomorrow I will the proud owner of 50% of a 
1985 928s euro, 105,000kms.  I'm going 50/50 in buying the car with my 
father - we've both always wanted one since they first came out.

The timing belt is being replaced today as well as having a decent 
service so that its all ready to go on the weekend.

I'm currently looking for a double sided coin so that I can flip my 
father for the first drive.  

Looking forward to having a stupid grin on my face all weekend and 
posting some really stupid questions in the near future.

1985 928s euro

PS: Are there any other Australians on the list?  I've seen a New 
Zealander or two - I think.
