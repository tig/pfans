Hi all,

I gave myself three months time to learn to appreciate the color of my
all leather interior. This color would be best described as being
brownish with a liverish/purple accent. Those months are now over and
I'm seriously considering changing the interior color to black, because
I suppose that would be the easiest colorchange and because it would go
well with the exterior of the car which is Tannengrun (something like
pinetree green) So last saturday I took Big Bertha out to pay a visit to
a leather upholsterer and ask for his expert opinion. After expressing
his admiration for the craftmanship it took to do a leather interior
like that, he basically told me to forget about it because the new coat
of paint "would not last very long and peel off".
I didn't want to question the man's know-how so I left, determined to
seek help elsewhere.
All tips and opinions appreciated.

-Piet
