Well, that's it. Only ten years and a bulb burns out. These @#$@#$ 928s are
just too high maintenance!

Was the lady in question also amused?

....for the good reason that the old one had failed in the time honored
method of light bulbs. It filament had, over time, boiled off most of the
tungsten of which it's made. This kept on happening until the filament got
so thin that the next significant vibration (or turn-on transient) snapped
it, at which point it couldn't conduct electricity any more and the bulb
went out.

Meanwhile, the tungsten evaporated from the filament had, over time,
condensed on the inside of the (relatively cool) glass bulb, making a thin
metallic film which both reflects and absorbs light; this is why old bulbs
slowly get darker. Tungsten-halogen bulbs are designed to prevent this
metal coating; the tungsten vapor is encouraged to redeposit on the
filament, which can then run hotter and live longer.

>Have I slipped a peg in the originality stakes ?

Not with your crack to your date, but your discovery of shiny old light
bulbs does have precedent. Well, one out of two ain't bad.
