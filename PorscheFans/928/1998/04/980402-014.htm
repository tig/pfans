Drove my 85 most of the way to the frenzy last year without the
power steering (i am from St-Louis so it was quite a way...).

At highway speed, its not too bad but its still a workout, especially
when you hit a lot of sharp turn.

I am sure that you will opt to get it fix.  I was ready to replace
the broken belt, in the dark, in the parking lot of the hotel where I
stayed if I had too.  The folks hosting the Frenzy were nice enough 
to let me borrow their lift (thats why I am not in the picture).
