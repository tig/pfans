It is a common belief among UK drivers that you can't get done for 
speeding if there is only one erm gentleman in the police car and he 
doesn't have any measuring equipment.

This is wrong.  The other day I was booked for allegedly speeding at 114 
by a policeman on his own, apparently in his own car - a totally 
unequipped and unmarked T5.  He said he was doing me on "standing 
quarter mile", meaning he followed me for a quarter of a mile whilst 
watching his speedo.  I may add that this was a deserted straight dual 
carriageway and I don't ever drive recklessly.

He said I would receive a summons through the post and could expect to 
be disqualified for a period defined by the court on the day.

So the moral is, don't believe pub folklore regarding speeding, and if 
you see a dark red S4 doing no more than 70 on motorways - you'll know 
who it is.

Also, if anyone has any experience of UK speeding laws, please drop me a 
line.
