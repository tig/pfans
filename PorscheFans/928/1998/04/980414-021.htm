	Vince,

	So, what you saying is the nylon guide that slides up and down the tubular 
	guide is worn and the only way to replace then is total disassembly of the 
	door. I was OK until you mentioned welding.  So, that's massive surgery.  I 
	guess I'll put up with the rattle until I have a really good reason to go 
	in there.  The shame is I had the door mostly apart to replace the window 
	motor two weeks ago.  I was half way there and didn't know it.  Oh well.


I don't mean to discourage you by mentioning the "welding" part.  There's a good chance
that the nylon roller is worn, and since you're in there, might as well replace it.  If it
does require replacement, order a new roller, take it to a machine shop and they should be
able to do it for you.  The rest of the disassembly is tedious and just require some
patience.

You really don't want the rattle to continue very long since this will speed up the wear
on the nylon guides and the mounting screws that hold the glass in place will eventually
work itself out.
