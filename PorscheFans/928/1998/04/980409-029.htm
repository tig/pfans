That warning light used to make my body shrivel in places until I had a
nice long conversation with Mark @ DEVEK about my shark.  I actually went=

in for a POST-purchase inspection and he told me everything I ever wanted=

to know about my car as well as prepared me for the maintenance that must=

be done to a 10 year old car.  I didn't freak out because I figured if
you're going to drive one of the fastest cars in the world (even by today=
's
standards) and a quality one such as ours, you must be prepared to pay.
Come on folks, very few of us could afford to buy these guys brand new an=
d
yet with a 20k purchase and perhaps another 5-10k you could have a near
perfect example of world class speed and reliability. Heck of alot better=

than the original 70k it would have cost. Its a joke to me that someone
would rather buy any other new car and soup it up. I believe that after
you've had German you'll never go back!! ( I am Hispanic by the way/ See.=
=2E,
no racism!) Anyway,  Mark said,"These cars have ghosts. Don't let it get =
to
you," so.., I don't. But there is a great deal of reassurance to know
everything about your car especially when it's been diagnosed by someone
that is a hell of alot more knowledgeable about my car than I am. My
recommendation is for those of you that are still sort of new to your car=

or to the 928 family to take it over to DEVEK and have them give it the
complete once over.  Its a small price to pay for piece of mind.  BTW, fo=
r
those of you that had door locks coming back up on you after you locked t=
he
door and the car would be unlocked but the alarm activated, I sprayed a
lubricant into the lock assembly and the problem went away.  Seems to me
that if it gets dry and jams,  the owners manual states that it will not
let the door lock.  Look it  up.   Man I love these cars!!  But I have
noticed that I am becoming somewhat of a snob.  I went to buy the
Excellence magazine and debated for a while on whether to get it or not
because it didn't have enough 928 content for my needs.  I am addicted!!!=
!!
 =3D-]  I didn't want to look at Porsche's,  I wanted to look and read an=
d
breathe Shark!!  I believe I am over the edge.
