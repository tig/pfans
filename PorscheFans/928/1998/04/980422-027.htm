So since I've owned my Shark for only 7 months take the following with
whatever sized grain of salt you need. Other listers may of course
snicker (politely) at the newbie offering sage advice.  But as one
newbie to (potentially) another:

>OK, I have polled several '28 owners about their cars and I have received many
>"different" views on the car as a whole.  

David, a few people are very lucky and rarely have to have non-routine
maintenance performed on their cars.  IMHO, most people are, however,
not so lucky.  In addition, each car off the line is different from
every other in small ways that can effect the life-time cost of the
car.

I've owned 2 1988 VW Sciroccos. (No not a P-car, but bear with me for
a moment.)  I bought one new and drove it for 100K miles during 7
years of ownership. (Got it totaled by an 84 year-old).  During that
time my seat-of-the-pants estimate (I've still got all the records so
if I took the time I could give an _exact_ number) is that I spent
less than $1.5K on non-routine repairs - that does _not_ include items
that have well-defined lifetimes such as tires, brake pads, and
shocks. The second Sirocco I've owned for less than a year and I've
just about damn near replaced everything on it: alternator,
_transmission_, fuel tank, heater core,  etc.

(Call my crazy. Call me #$%^ing insane - go ahead - my office mate
does. If I could find another daily driver that I _liked_ to drive,
could afford to drive everyday, and was _willing_ to drive in Boston
Winters I'd ditch the money pit - but damn it I _like_ 16v Sciroccos
and I won't drive the Shark everyday in Boston Commuter Hell)


The main difference between the cars was of course the PO. In the
first case it was me and only me. In the second it was two POs who
didn't even bother to keep the service records.  

My Shark has all the service records, 30K miles on the Odo and at
least the second PO (I'm the third) was very respectful of it. I've
owned it for about 7 months and I've spent roughly $2K on non-routine
service (t-belt, water pump, etc) and about $1K on other "necessities"
such as tools, the shop manuals, wax, a good tire gauge, etc.


An 88 or 89 auto is a 10 year-old car. It's going to have 50K miles on
it at least. More likely it will have 75K to 100K miles on the Odo.

IMHO, a ten year-old car's hoses and belts and seals and God knows
what else are near the end of their life-cycle. If the PO(s) haven't
already replaced much of the rubber you will have to. If you don't
have a complete service history assume that _you_ will have to
complete that service history - at your own cost.

I've been reading the list for 8 months now and if I'm not mistaken
most people asking the questions your are asking are told that you've
got to expect to spend several thousand dollars during the first year
of ownership of an older Shark (or maybe any Shark).  Note: I wrote
"expect." I didn't write that you _will_ spend the money - but you
have to be _prepared_ to do so if you want to be able to drive it.  If
you're very handy with a wrench you can probably cut the above number
in half but you'll still have to buy the parts. But, if you do the
work in your free-time it's not a daily-driver, right?

Personally, I don't ever expect any car older than 5 years to require
less than $1K of non-routine service every year in order to keep it in
tip-top shape.  I'm pleasantly surprised if they don't but I assume
that the _next_ year Murphy will visit me.

If you're willing to do some of the work yourself and can two-wheel it
when the Shark's sick and waiting at home you can minimize the
maintenance costs. But $1000 won't buy too many donated Shark organs.

My advice would be to wait a while and build up a first year repair
fund before you hunt for a Shark.




As for:

>but as a whole is the Shark really worth the "extra" effort it
>allegedly demands

Yes. 

For me.
