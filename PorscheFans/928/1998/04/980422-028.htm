>So, back to my question at the top; what is the range
of resistance of the outside air temperature sensor?

Patrick - Here's a bit I wrote last year about the heater. Notice
in particular the resistance of the whole sensor/slider loop.
Theindividual sensors should read about 1Kohm.

Remove the parcel shelf above the driver's knees. Find a plastic
box with two cables coming into it, and a rotary lever arm with a rod
connected to it. That has a lot to do with controlling your heat or
lack thereof. When the rod position is up, you get max heat; when
it's down, no heat. The lever moves about 45 degrees from the
horizontal in each direction.

If the rod is anywhere but fully down when it's warm inside and
you don't want heat, that's causing your problem. The position of
the arm is controlled by signals on the cable connector with four
wires. With the ignition on, you should read battery voltage
between pins 3 and 11 of the connector. You should read in the
vicinity of 3K ohms between pins 4 and 12 of the connector, and
that resistance should vary by about 1 K when you move the 
temperature slider from full hot to full cold. The wires on
the other connector are outputs from the box are outputs which
control various flaps.

Of course there are lots of other things, like leaky vacuum hoses
and bad solenoids which can cause your problem, but this is a 
good place to start.
