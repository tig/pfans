If you were not unhappy with your Pirellis, its not such a bad idea to
do it again. I originally re-shod my not-Porsche (93.5 Infiniti G20)
with its OEM tire, 195/65HR-14 Bridgestone Potenza RE92's. After 20k
miles, 3 alignments, 4 rotate & balances, the inside edges of the 2nd
set of tires was bald on all 4 tires. All 4 tires made a racket going 
down the road, too.

NTB/NTW kept telling me the rear was "within spec" with 1.0 and 1.5 
degrees negative (top tilts in) camber. Plus its not adjustable.

Studied my service manual (Infiniti ship's 'em in the trunk with every 
new car, complete with a box and shelf, hint: Porsche are you 
listening?) and learned the rear McPhearson struts were very similar to 
those on the front of my former VW Golf. Jacked the G20 up, loosened 
the strut mounting bolts and found a bunch of adjustment. Later learned 
I adjusted to 0.6 and 0.3 degrees negative camber. Think I'll have to 
take a rat-tail file to some holes and create some more adjustment.

Possibly NTB realized I had been a regular at that store for about 10 
years, but they treated me right. They agreed I only got half the life 
out of my tires that I should have. Got out with a new alignment (said 
200 miles were left on my prior alignment warranty) and 4 new Pirelli 
HP's (think they are special-for-Sears), total cost was $135.

Then I decided to check the web to find out something about my new
tires. http://www.pirelli.com sure was a surprise. Must admit I spent
little time looking for tires and more time looking for Eva.

'83 928S that might be wearing Pirellis soon, too.
