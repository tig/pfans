>When making quick direction changes, I feel the suspension is a little
soft, I can feel the weight shift and it seems to take a few moments to
settle into the bend and feel solid. I can also feel the rear shifting a
little if I lift off a bit in a bend. I'm wondering if it has something to
do with the Weissach rear suspension, perhaps the wider wheels and offsets
are affecting it or is this normal.

Sounds like tired shock absorbers (dampers) to me. My car has similarly
wide tires and wheels and unmodified Weissach suspension, and it certainly
does not hesitate settling into a bend.

However, it is reasonable for the rear to start to move out if you lift the
throttle in a corner (bend). Application of power transfers weight to the
rear wheels and tires, permitting them to exert more force to resist
outward motion of the rear. Lifting off transfers weight to the front, away
from the rear, unloading the rear tires and reducing their cornering
capacity. This is a subtle effect in a 928, but a huge and often
catastrophic effect in a 911.

In the front-drive cars you're used to, you can save an overspeed condition
in a corner by lifting the throttle; this relieves the front tires of the
additional job of transmitting power and permits them to devote their
capability more to keeping the front end from sliding out, the typical exit
mode of a front-heavy, front-drive car. In a powerful rear-drive car, you
generally want to keep at least some power on once you're committed to the
corner. The amount of throttle will determine the amount of oversteer.

Oh, at a more mundane level, make sure your tires have the correct
pressures. The stock S4 wheel and tire arrangement should be used with 36
psi (2.5 bar) front and 44 psi (3 bar) rear. If you're running GTS-size
wheels and tires, Porsche recommends GTS pressures as well; 36 psi front
and rear.

>Has anyone got recommendations on stiffening the suspension?

Check your shocks first. Generally, make sure your car is healthy (this
includes proper alignment of all four wheels) and then drive it for a few
months. The 928 S4 is an amazingly capable car and deserves the opportunity
to show you what it can do before you modify it.
