Mark,
Let me shed a little light on a couple of your questions/comments.

First your math on the "pinning" of the rear axle has left out a couple of
big factors. The fact that the larger width and therefore larger contact of
the tire on the road puts much more stress on the toe in/out action and
exaggerates it immensely. Add to that the extra weight of the larger tires
and it multiplies it even more.
Punch those 2 factors in to your "trig math" and you will find a different
outcome.

Second you are comparing a 16v early 928 single exhaust to a 32-valve dual
exhaust. Yes, the early cars can gain a lot of extra breathing from a custom
header/exhaust setup, however you will not see the same gain by doing the
same to the factory tubular header and dual exhaust setup of the 32-valve S4
engines.

Try comparing apples to apples, instead of apples to oranges ;-)
