Hello form the Antipodes.

    To start out, the only 928 that late was the GTS.  As far as investment goes,
there's probably better investments than automobiles, and possibly better
automobiles as investments.  The 928's beauty is in the joy of driving the beast,
combined with a modicum of practicality.  For sheer driving pleasure, the 5-speed
wins hands down.  It's a bit chunky in city traffic, but that is no venue for
pleasurable driving.  The auto tames the car somewhat, and makes the 928 feel
almost like a taxi when crawling in traffic.  (In New Zealand, our taxis tend to
be large 6-cylinder saloon cars, with automatic transmissions).
    If you're a pathological hoon, buy as 5-speed.  If you want to drive in
traffic lots, get an automatic, but why bother with a 928 for this ?
    Most cars bought as investments are kept cosseted in garages, and this would
be a shame.   They're such fun to drive.  Can I interest you in the Auckland
Harbour Bridge ?

    Good luck
        Andy McIntyre
