About a week ago, I asked shark-owners if they had ever found a method
of repairing damage to etched anodized wheels.  I had resigned myself to
purchasing a set of 17" take-offs from one of the local dealers to
remedy my problem.  Well, last weekend, with nothing to loose, I tried
something else, and it worked very well.

Got a couple of sheets of 1500, 600, and 400 wet-sandpaper.  I knew that
all the various polishing compounds I tried did almost nothing.  I found
that the 400 paper worked the best and it's possible that even 300 would
have worked even better.  The surface damage looked like someone had let
one of those tire cleaners dry on the tires and the over-spray and
drippage from the spray dried on the wheels.  If you look at the
ingredients, many of them are CAUSTIC and will chemically react to an
anodized surface turning the finish milky.  

I wet sanded using light pressure and saw a powdery residue coming off.
There are very fine scratches in the metal and using these as a guage
for material removal, I knew that very little material was actually
coming off.  After sanding the surface, I noticed the damage had been
reduced a lot.  I followed this with some polishing compound applied by
hand, and several final rinses of detergent and water to remove the
petrolium-base of the compound from the surface.  After drying the
wheel, I applied several light coats of clear - this made what ever was
left by the sandpaper completely dissappear.  Net result, I can see NO
EVIDENCE of chemical etching on 3 of my wheels and the 4th would have
been the same but I was running out of daylight (still, only slight
evidence and only if you look for it).

I found that the compound was essential for removal of the film that
coats the wheels.  Also found that for heavy brake-dust removal, again I
took a chance with nothing to loose - I bought a brass-wire brush that
was for cleaning a stove-top.  Used this in conjunction with mag-cleaner
and had the hose handy to remove the caustic solution immediatly after
brushing.  Did several applications to get all traces of grimy wheel
residue completely off.

Man, they look new.  I would still like some 17's though!  If anyone is
selling a set of take-off C2 Turbo Cups, or 993's, let me know.
