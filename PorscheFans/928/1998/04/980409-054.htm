Hi Ed:

Thanks for the tips.  I haven't done any troubleshooting yet
and your post will sure come in handy.  What is the
procedure for checking the relays?  Have DMM back in hands
now.

Will install coils once they get here, can't hurt and they
were backordered anyways so might as well get over it now at
85k in mileage.  
Glad I have small hands to reach in there though...
Phil
ps.  cool, you have a GT also!?!  Last year there weren't
many on the list (which BTW I hope gets rebuilt soon)...
