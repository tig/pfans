	It will be interesting to install the original fan
	without the air pump.  the belt adjuster is on the
	air pump...

	Thanks.  For general interest, I didn't actually
	chuck the whole airpump assembly.  I am
	freewheeling it.  I removed it (2 bolts) and
	disabled the the rotors (this can be done either
	with finesse or with violence; the result is the
	same,although I want to save the equipment in
	case the law ever makes me put it back).  It
	retains it's position in the pulley triad, so there
	are no slack belts on my car, or pants.  I want to
	toss the hoses in the drawer as well, and plug the
	holes to the air filter, etc., but I'm unsure of how
	far I can go.  I only am doing it to stay basically
	clean and logical, not to gain power, but I
	wouldn't doubt that there is a horse or two to be
	gained, as well as the common sense of losing 15
	pounds of equipment.  The original suggestion
	came when a mechanic noticed that the airpump
	was grumbling, so why have it working hard at
	all.

	Might as well go all the way!  Chuck the fan and install an electric one.  You'll
get a few more horses...  You do have an early MY right?
