Greetings!

Spring has indeed come to eastern Maine.  Even the mud is not as bad as
usual, for some reason.

I took the Shark down to the shop for its spring oil change and general
look-over.  I also wanted to fix the rear window wiper (it had become inop
during a sleet storm) and the hatch lock which does not work with the key.

In around 4500 miles, there had been ZERO oil consumption.  The engine was
dry-dry underneath, with a tad seepage around the oil pan (we decided to
tighten the pan bolts a tad:  big thick cork gasket).

Frigged with the hatch release, but no fix for the key release.  Inside
release works MUCH better now.

Checked belt tension...ok...(Roger's rule:  whenever the car visits the
doctor, the belt tension is checked, and a little look at condition.  My
belt was replaced by the PO at 30,000, and I will replace mine at 60, which
is about 16000 miles of sharking from now)

New fuel filter.  The old one wasn't plugged, but COULD have been original,
which seems strange, as all services were done by the original Porsche
dealer.  Anyway, I replaced mine under the safe rather than sorry dictum

Now, the fun part.  The rear wiper.  My OEM fuse chart does not show a fuse
in the fusebox.  My mechanic's documentation does.  BUT, the fuse place that
his chart showed was empty.  He put a fuse in there, and nothing happened.
But the fuse NEXT to where the fuse should have been, was empty too, and he
put a fuse in there, and...voila....the wiper works fine.

Question:  If the fuse blanks in my fuse box were empty, and the indicated
position wouldn't make the wiper work anyway, why would the NEXT blank work.
AND, how could the wiper work at all, before the fix.  Worked all last
summer and into the winter before giving up?

Do you suppose that my car has a case of the dreaded Mad Rear Wiper Syndrome?

Anyway. Ready for its first long trip next Tuesday.  I am leaving here for
about twelve days of touring in the Shark....going to Amelia Island to the
concours, and then....no schedule until about the 25th. YEEEEEEha!
