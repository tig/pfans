During a weekend trip across I-40 to Angel Fire, Red River, Taos, and
Santa Fe, NM, back to Amarillo, bothersome problems ocurred.
 1) Following intermittent occurrences of the red "brake pad sensor"
warning light appearing, I heard again intermittent revolution related
noise coming from right front wheel, braking unaffected; without
removing wheel, appeared disc/wheel okay, so continued to drive. Only
heard noise 2-3 times though warning light sometimes appeared, sometimes
did not. Are the brakes uncomplicated enough for a non 928 shop to r/r?
If not could diagram be faxed to me?
2) During rip, I broke down and took car through automatic car wash.
Driver's side mirror whih is apparently three basic pieces was turned
forward to front of car by machine. The base which is bolted into door
of car is solid. Vertcal piece which forms rise between base and the
third portion which holds the actual mirror portion is loose from base
and will turn in outside arc approximately 200 degrees. Electrical
connections from door to mirror are intact as the mirror will still
adjust from switch/joystick??. Cannot see how to solve this problem.
Please help. 
BTW, I'm 6'10" tall, spent close to 9 hours in car stopping to shop gas
etc. and was less tired than in my Suburban. Car performed beautifully
flat 85 across NM 1-40 at 3500 ft. then over Wheeler Mountain pass at
11,000 ft. on switch back road only wide enough for one car to pass. Why
do we have to use all our time at work so we can afford the short jolts
of ecstacy these machines allow us?

Thanks in advance.
