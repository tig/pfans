I had the same problem. Mine is an S4, so I don't know if your '86 has the
same configuration.

Mine had a small leak with the fuell hose which out of the top of the tank. It
is accessable through the rear hatch area. Lift up the mat, peel of the silver
pad and remove the plastic cover.

The second case wasn't gas at all, although it smelled like it. It turned out
to be the high intensity washer solution. There was a crack in the hose
connected to the resiovior. That was very close to the HVAC inlet, so the
smell had a clear path for entry into the cockpit.

Hope that helps
