Hi, Mike!
I had exactly the same problem on my '87S4. 
It looks like the lower vent blowing hot is in fact a result in the way the
ducts are designed. The real problem is that your air mixing/distribution
system may not be working properly. I have heard this is a fairly common
occurence in 928s..so it looks like debugging it would be a useful skill to
develop!!

The cold/ warm air system is controlled by a number of valves/vents which are
activated by the auxiliary vacuum circuit of the car. Any (even partial)  loss
of vacuum will result in a number of "troubled" accessories.

By any chance would you have noticed that your Cruise Control is kinda'
sluggish? Yet another troubled vacuum activated device, and an indication you
may have a leaky vacuum system!!

Fortunately, vacuum problems can be diagnosed fairly easily with a fantastic
little tool called "Mitty vac", which comes with a very comprehensive booklet
on how to trouble shoot all kinds of problem in your car. 
It is relatively inexpensive (~$40.00) but worth EVERY penny!
(I bought mine at Automotion in Sunnyvale, CA)

The pick up for the accessories' vacuum line is right on top of your brake
booster, you'll see a small hose, and about 4 inches further down, you'll see
a check valve.  Attached to the check valve is a rubber manifold (looks like a
cross)

You can connect the Mittyvac tool to each of the individual lines (through the
adapters delivered with it)  and pump out each line to isolate which one(s)
are the source of the leak(s).
BTW, the line going to the vacuum reservoir should be pumped last: it will
take you a few minutes of pumping to clear it, and the problem is likely to be
somewhere else anyways!!

Once you know which line is leaking (as indicated by the falling vacuum
indicator..),  just follow the line and test each component separately...

I was lucky to find that I had only a stuck check valve and a cracked rubber
distribution manifold...Susan at Devek loves my phone calls : "And what will
you be needing today??"

One last word: be careful when handling plastic and rubber hoses, after a few
years under the hood they become brittle and break easily!

Happy (leaks) hunting!

Hope this helps.
