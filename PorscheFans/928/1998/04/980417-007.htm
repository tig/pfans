I have spoken to the owner, and I looked at the car while we were on the
outbound leg of our vacation.  The exterior is pretty clean (some polishing
marks, but no dents or major scratches that I observed).  The interior is
average-minus, due to wear, but no major faults.  Paul noted on the telephone
that it does have some electical problems (surprise) and that the sunroof and
AC are not currently working.  He also noted that it is shifting sluggishly,
but that may be because it hasn't been driven a lot.

I did not note any oil spots on the floor under it, and it sounded very good
when I started it up, but I did not get to drive it (time constraints.)  The
tools are missing from the kit, misc. other minor shortcomings.

It really needs a complete mechanical check to set a reasonable price.  A clean
mechanical check would make his asking price very reasonable.
