Stephane,
Best way to find out is to try it.
I just installed a set of Design 90 wheels from a 91 GT on my 85. I though
for sure I would have to remove the spacers (21mm), but decided to
cautiously try it with them first. The GT wheels are 9" wide with the 55mm
offset and you can barely get a small finger in between the tire and fender
lip, but no contact under hard cornering yet with 245/45-16s, and it looks
Killer.

Give it a try, but use common sense so as not to damage your tire or fender.
