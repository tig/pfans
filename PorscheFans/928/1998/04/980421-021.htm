	MARK STEPHEN,

	Don't take chances with the timing belt, the water pump will leak after 
the bearing has gone bad, and it can ruin the timing belt.  Lose the 
timing belt and the repair can be more than what you paid for the car!  
Water pump failure is ofter the bearing then the seal, by the time you 
see it leak it could be ready to sieze.  Join the Porsche club, and find 
several sources for parts.  One club benifit my dealer gives a discount 
to club members.

	Replace everything; all the rollers, crank seal, belt, pump and the 
plastic bearings on the tensioner.  Done right it won't have to be done 
for another 60,000 miles, done wrong and lose the engine! It' not a 
impossible do it yourself project, but you should have the manuals and 
you will need some tools.    You really should get the manuals even if 
you don't plan to work on it, they are fun to read and help you 
understand whats wrong. There is a special flywheel lock (a must have) 
and a tesioner tool.  Unlike any other car Porsche does not use a on car 
spring tensioner.  The flywheel lock is not real expensive and several 
places rent the tension tool (the only way to set the tension).  Also 
figure on plenty of time don't do any work on this car in a hurry.  It 
took me 3 weeks, ordered the wrong part and needed one I didn't order in 
the first batch of parts.  I would worry about a shop that is willing to 
do this for much less than $1000.00 it's alot of work and the parts are 
not cheap!  After 1000 miles the tension is supposed to be reset, the 
shop charge for that should be reasonable.
