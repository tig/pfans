Last sunday we had the third event in the young history of our
Dutch 928 club at the scenic "Veluwe". Seventeen fine 928's
showed up and the club already grew to 34 members. Quit a few
really clean and surprisingly well maintained samples of the
species. The are some 400 cars registered down here (we live
below sea level, so the sharks feel at home).

Main event was a drive through the country side while answering
questions and thus finding your way back while getting lost as
little as possible. I was passenger in Kevin "there are no
(speed)limits" Jacksons' very healthy 5-speed S4. Man did we have
fun. I really needed that extra lateral support in the improved
sport seats. We passed most others while this was clearly not the
goal of the drive. In our enthusiasm we also did the most U-turns
and by far covered the most distance while in reverse. Despite
getting all the gas station names right we still were not overall
winner, the only disappointment that sunny afternoon. From this
point on we only can improve!

The club got recognised by Porsche AG as one of the firsts 928
clubs and within a few months. This normally takes half a year or
more for a new club. All the credit goes to our chairman who had
to use mucho diplomacy, negotiation and politics. One of the
demands from them was an official chance of name and using there
logo's. They don't go easy on their followers and want to be sure
whether a club is managed rather professionally and so on.

Next event is a club concourse where we chose achievements like
shortest gear stick etc. Hehe. Then, due to the recognition, we
are allowed to join the other Dutch Porsche clubs (you know those
guys lacking a few cylinders) in a track event. Watch out guys
here come the 8's.
