Funny you should mention this, I finally have the books open
to start testing my coils too.

From page 28-13, which looks like the 4.5 / 4.7 engine

Step 5. Check resistors and ignition coil.

The 0,4 ohm resistor: 0.35 ... 0.45 ohm
The 0,6 ohm resistor: 0.55 ... 0.65 ohm

Ignition coil primary (term 1 and 15):  0.33 ... 0.46 ohm 
(picture shows testing between threaded terminal and center
coil plug

Ignition coil secondary (term 1 and 4):  7 ... 12 k ohms
(same picture but using other threaded term)

If resistance bad then replace resistor or ignition coil

If ok then 

Step 6.  Measure voltage of ignition coil terminal 15
against ground.
Turn on ignition.

voltage at term 15: at least 3 V at battery voltage of at
least 11 volts (measure at same time).

It goes on from here to check starting voltage, etc. and
I'll not continue as this gets complicated and the manual
has numerous warnings about high tension leads, etc.

***

Later, on page 28-62
The same procedures are listed for the dual coil setup but
values are different:

Primary resistance of term 1 vs. term 15:  0.4 to 0.7 ohm
Secondary resistance of term 1 vs. term 4:  5 to 8.7 k ohms

Check that plugs (on coil) are not missing.

If plugs are missing or casting compound has run out,
replace ignition coil and ignition control unit. <--- easy
for them to say, who has these and how much!?!  gulp...

Note:
Avoid an ignition test via the spark gap by pulling off the
spark plug connectors.  There would be danger of destroying
the ignition coil and control unit.

Hope this helps a bit.  Putting away manual now...
