Hi everybody!

On the neverending thread concerning suitable rubber fins for our sharks:

I talked to the tire testers at Zuffenhausen last week about their thoughts on
fitting Bridgestone SO-2s on my '87 S4 with 16" wheels (225 f, 245 r). They
_do not_  recommend doing this! They consider the 16" 225 SO-2 N3 to be
'undrivable' as a front tire, since this is apparently a _rear_ tire design
(sidewall stiffness etc.). Of course their standards differ somewhat from mine
(or yours), so the average driver might not really notice. But since I often
do use the capabilities of the car to the fullest extent on the 'Bahn, I'll
stick (no pun intended) to the SO-1s for the time being. BTW, if you have
_17"_ wheels, SO-2s are ok.

That said, I have 3 questions:

1. Last week I noticed that when turning on the ignition (not starting yet)
the voltage indicator is well below 12 Volts. Car starts ok, but I can't
remember noticing this before (battery fully charged, measured 12.4 V at the
cigarette lighter). Is this normal?

2. After washing the car, there is water on the windows after lowering and
raising them, so there must be some water finding its way into the doors. The
outer rubber seals look fine except for a very slight crack on the drivers
side. I don't like the idea of my doors slowly filling up with water, just
think of all the extra weight to lug around. Seriously, though, will this
cause problems in the long run? Is this a normal occurrance?

3. This has happened (only) twice since I bought the car last may: When
turning into a corner, there is a 'hesitation' at one point in the steering,
as if something is sticking. Then everything is normal again. Like I said, it
only happened twice so far in one year, but please don't tell me its the
steering rack (the horror, the horror...). The second time it happened, I was
just on my way to the Porsche dealer for a free (yes, free!!! by Porsche!!!
spring check-up), so the car was up on a lift minutes after and the steering
thoroughly checked, nothing found.


Any and all comments appreciated.
