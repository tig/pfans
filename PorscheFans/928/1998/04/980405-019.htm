<pre>
to the person that has what sounds like a ticking hydraulic valve lifter.
Slightly stuck ones will go away when warm.

A solution that I used on my 85 audi coupe GT is with the car fully warmed up,
and across the street from the oil change place I add a 1/2  - 1 quart of I
think its called Rislone.  I let it circulate for 5 minutes and drain the oil.
This rislone stuff is a solvent that will loosen stuck lifters.  There is a
warning on the side of the can that if you have a very dirty engine it can
loosen too much stuff and plug the oil pick up.  

My experience is that German crankcases and the works under the valve covers
stay pretty clean even on hi mileage cars.

The ticking should be gone, if it isnt, repeat.  I did  this 2x to my audi 25k
ago,  no noise.

My experience is that the thick additives dont work, you need the thin solvent
like solution.  I have heard of people using diesel fuel or kerosene, even
parts cleaning solvent.  Just dont leave it in for more than a few minutes.

I dont know if you want to do this to your 928, my 5 cyl audi can take.  Do
this at your own risk!

Good luck
