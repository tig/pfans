A run to the top of Haleakala (our 10,000 volcano on Maui) seemed like a
good way to spend sunday after noon and check out my newly aquired 1990
928gt. I just finished some servicing (oil, filter, coolant change, checked
toothed timing belt, adj. all driver belts) and wanted to see how the temp
would be on a steep climb to 10,000ft.

Everything was fine tell I got to around 6,000, I wasn't pushing it hard,
keeping the rpm's below 4500. I noticed I was loosing my clutch pedal, it
was getting lower and lower, nothing happened when I pumped it. I then put
my toe under it a lifted it to the top and pumped it, it was back to
normal..............as I continued to climb it started getting lower again,
so i lifted again and it worked again, my ears were also having problems
and had to clear them. I'm thinks the clutch problems must be related to
the rapid change in atmospheric pressure? It was unable to self adjust to
the change?

Then at 8500ft the toothed belt warning light came on, I was only running
at around 2300rpm? Was the belt tenisioner also having problems adjusting
to the atmospheric pressure? I just checked the belt tension and it was
fine, the car only has 9700 miles on it, it had to be the altitude. I
slowed way down, keep my rpm real low and heading back down. On the way
down at about 8000ft it pulled over and shut the engine off, turned it back
on and no more warning light.  On the way down I took it real easy. Just
the opposite way now happening with the clutch, the pedal was getting
firmer? I made a point to work the clutch often as I descended. 

Again at real low rpms, at around 4000ft the belt warning light came on. I
pulled over, turned off the engine, re-started it and no more light. As I
got back closer to sea level I stepped up my rpms a little, everything was
fine, clutch was back to normal & no warning light. Back at sea level I
took it to 6000 rpms in 3rd & 4th every time was back to perfect?

It had to be the decreased pressure that the clutch cylinder and the belt
tensioner had a problem with? Certainly  Dr. Porsche would have not
overlooked this driving condition? My are has been at sea level for at
least the last 7 years, is something not working? Could I have an air
bubble in both these systems?

Any Idea?
