It's BS

That's what the owners manual states.

Or, they are simply mis-informed. 

I recall that the owner's manual states that the only effect from
disconnecting the battery is that once the battery is reconnected and
the engine is started it may idle roughly for up to 10 minutes. (10
minutes is from memory - might be 5 or 15...)

Like Michael, I disconnect and reconnect my battery quite often and
have had no problems.
