Andy asked about car ramps for the low 928 front end.  I ordered a set
of ramps that are designed for this type of car.  They are about twice
as long as regular to make it an easier incline, and when not in use,
the front section slides up into the taller piece for easy storing. 
They are heavy gauge metal, and very strong.  No problem with my S4.
I ordered them from a company called: Sporty's Shops, they are in
Batavia, Ohio, Phone #1-800-543-8633, Cost $165 (shipping+ $12.95)
Product #9865 (Universal Car Ramps).

Also, regarding the A/C system in the 928.  My system has been upgraded
to the R134A.  Had a couple of pieces on the original system go bad, so
it was a good time to change it over.  Two years later, and it is
chilly,chilly,chilly.  I have black leather, and still have not had any
problems cooling the car down.  Only use the rear A/C if some poor
person gets stuffed back there.  Cost for change over $1,100, including
a little labor for diagnosis on old system.

Also, I do have a question.  I would like to change the
antifreeze/coolant myself, but I am not sure how to refill the radiator
on my S4.  Shop manuals just arrived on Friday, but they only mentioned
adding coolant until it reaches filler neck, but my radiator has no
traditional cap.  Do they mean add it to the reservoir (I know it is
pressurized), or add it through one of the hose openings, etc.???  Sorry
if this is a stupid question, but something so easy has me stumped.

Thanks.
