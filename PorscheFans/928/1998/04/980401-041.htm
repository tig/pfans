As promised, here's my experience installing a lsd.

Differences in early and late lsd's:

There's 2 different lsd's:  pre '85 and post - I'm told the same for
auto or manual tranny's.  The late ones typically go for $1250 used and
the early ones for $500 or under.  Mark Anderson had put an early one in
his car and sold me an early one for mine.  The significant difference
between the 2 is that the ring gear mounting face is 3.8 mm (0.146")
inboard on the early differentials (the ring gears must be thinner).

Mark said his tranny shop used spacers to make up the difference (I
never fully understood exactly what they spaced).  I elected to instead
machine the backside of the ring gear taking off about 0.145".  Of
course the ring gear is case hardened (and hard steel to begin with) so
this is not a really easy task.  Using a carbide tool and with some
supervision, I spent a few hours machining the ring gear.  The
tolerances on backlash are about 0.002=94 (0.05 mm) so you have to set
things up carefully and make sure you cut a deeper reference mark in
case something moves once you start cutting.  The early lsd is also
thicker than my late open diff.  To get enough thread engagement with
the existing bolts, I recessed the bolt holes on the outboard side of
the LSD by 0.100=94.  I had to then clean up the threads in the ring gear
with a plug (or bottoming) tap M12x1.25 =96 this is the extra fine M12
thread so you=92ll have to go to a good machine shop supply store.  I als=
o
had to take a little off of the speedo ring and its alignment pin.
Including setup, measuring, and machining, I spent 8 hours - I'm no
production machinist but I'm not soo bad either.

Installing a lsd:

I chose to do mine without removing the tranny from the car.

1. With the car on the ground, remove the 2 32 mm nuts on the axle
shafts (you can put on the spare tire to do this).

2. Put the car on jack stands and drain the differential fluid.

3. Lower the exhaust system (at least the rear half)

4. Remove the halfshafts  - 6 8 mm allens.  When reinstalling, torque in
a star pattern with clean dry threads.

5. Remove the axle flanges.  These are the output flanges from the
tranny.  I used and impact gun with a 17 mm socket.

6. Remove 6 13 mm bolts for differential taper bearing races and 13 mm
bolts for rear cover.  There=92s a 10 mm bolt for the speedo sensor.  Pry
out race carriers =96 the old o-ring and the tight clearances make this
hard.  Start by prying on the tabs and then tap with a mallet while
pulling.  Note which shims go on which side!

7. To remove the diff, I had to loosen the fuel tank strap.

8. With the diff out, you need to remove the ring gear and this implies
removing one of the tapered bearings and then the speedo gear.  The used
diff I got still had the tapered bearings on and 3 of the 4 on the 2
diff's were pretty difficult to remove.  I bought a Craftsman 0-6=94
bearing puller ($40) and it did a good job at pulling these.  I machined
a plug to go into the end of the diff=92s for the puller =96 it is also
useful for pressing the bearings onto the diff.

9. It is recommended that you replace the tapered bearing and races
whenever doing a differential change.  For the races, heat to the
carriers to 100C and they practically fall out using the puller. The
bearing is FAG 533060 & Race 32010x =96 Porsche part # 999 059 027 00 =96
list price is $49 each.  Not a common bearing but maybe you can find
aftermarket.

10. To remove the ring gear, the bolts are a 20 mm hex head (12Mx1.25
ultrafine thread).

11. Then install the ring gear and speedo ring on the LSD.  Press on the
bearings (requires some force) and press the races into the carriers.
Also replace the seals and o-rings.

12. Next, you install the LSD and should adjust preload and backlash.
Kim Crumb said he=92s always just dropped the new diff in putting the
shims back the way they were.  On mine, I put most of the shims on the
driver=92s side and then the preload did turn out to be the specified 0.3=
0
mm (measured between the gap of the carriers and the tranny).

13. For backlash, you hold the pinion gear.  The factory recommends
fabricating a piece of steel.  My handy Stanley wrecking bar seemed very
close to the factory dimensions and worked fine.  The backlash is
scribed on the ring gear (mine is 0.17 mm).  I used a magnetic base and
dial indicator mounted on one of the axle flanges to measure the
backlash =96 hold the pinion and then see how much play there is in the
ring gear.  You can also buy the special tools discussed in the workshop
manual.  Here, especially if you=92re machining the ring gear, start with
extra shims on the ring gear race carrier so things don=92t bind.  You
adjust the backlash by transferring shims from one side to the other.
If you have too little backlash, the ring and pinion contact near the
root of the teeth and it wears there.  Too much backlash, and it wears
near the tip eventually stress fracturing pinion teeth.

14. The 944 and 911 manuals specify a friction torque required to turn
the differential =96 around 2.5 ft-lbs.  No such spec is given in the 928
manual.  I measured 5 ft-lbs.  I talked to a couple of people and
finally concluded that the preload measurement is valued, especially if
it calls for the same number of shims as before.  Some thought 5 ft-lbs.
was dangerously much, others thought dangerously little.

15. I refilled with 3.5 qt. of Red-Line 75W-90 NS and 1 qt. of 75W-90.
I get some chatter from the LSD in slow tight turns so maybe more non-NS
is required (or friction modifier).

Many thanks to Mark Anderson (928Int) and Jeff Chandler (JCM see adds
for both of these in Pano). Kevin Gross answered a ton of detailed
questions and thanks to the list members giving support as well,
especially Marc Reviel and LL.

So far, things are working fine and we get a lot of traction off the
line.  Several list members witnessed (and smelled) a demo last weekend
=96 2 black stripes in David Lloyd=92s driveway.

It feels better getting on the power in turns but so far this is only on
the street so I=92m not pushing hard enough to really tell.  This Saturda=
y
we=92ll see how it goes at Lime Rock!

Best,
Kurt
