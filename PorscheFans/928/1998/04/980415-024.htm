Really?  And here was I thinking it had its engine hung out the rear,
air-cooled 
and horizontally opposed, as well as floor-hinged pedals and other
similarities
too numerous to mention.  C'mon, look at the thing!

Yes.  The 928 is more a German Corvette.  Or it could be a German Trans-Am.
I don't think any of these comparisons are stupid, actually.

Should I post this to 911@porschefans.com?
