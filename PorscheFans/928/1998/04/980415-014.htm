Why doesn't this surprise me? My Porsche dealer told me the door
switches had failed because *one* of the *four* interior lights didn't
work. You could tell the others were OK - they drove the car 20 miles
to deliver it back at night with the other three on since they had
left the hatch open with the spare and tools scattered everywhere. And
then they had moved the seat right to the back and it would no longer
move forward (it has still lost it's lumbar support adjustment, but I
can't face it going in again).

At the same service, they said I needed new valves for the windscreen
washers as the jets were weak. 30 seconds poking fuse wire down the
jets fixed that. They quoted GBP125 (about USD200) to recharge the a/c
so they could check the system out as I had a problem with it. An a/c
specialist found the leaking valve within five minutes with a sniffer
at no cost (he's fixing it tomorrow). I could go on about the other
mis-diagnoses, wrong parts supplied, parts still not delivered after
three months and how they virtually accused me of lying when they
could not find a fax I had sent to complain.

Then they sent me a glossy magazine about how customer service is so
important to them.

I suspect the Porsche-approved dealers train up the apprentices, then
all those with any ability leave to start on their own, making more
money for themselves doing work to a higher standard at twice the
speed and half the hourly rate. It's just a shame they can't take a
test to get the official stamp to maintain my service record.

Rant mode is now off.
