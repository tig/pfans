	what are you going to do about smog??????????
	Mine has full race exhaust and it passed california emissions  (the guy
	didnt noticed everything disconected but still attached and spinning except
	for the cat, which was replaced with a bipass tube and now is a little more
	obvious with a 3.5" diam pipe off of Devek Headers)
	readings were well within limits.  a true test of the efficiency of the 928
	engine.
	let us all know what you are going to do about smog tests in your area.

	See if I understand you right... You have race exhaust, non-operational air pump,
a bypass tube and it PASSED California smog?  Wow.. a hard act to follow.  What MY is your
928?
