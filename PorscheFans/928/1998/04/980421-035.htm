This is absolutely unbelievable, I've been doing business for quite some
time and have hundreds of happy customers, and for once I get behind during
a busy time of the year and two people are out to hurt my business with two
posts which aren't even accurate (that's called libel, by the way).

First of all, Mr. Gedes, I did not cash your check until I was ready to
ship your rims/tires out. I deposited your *personal* check on 4/13 and
shipped your order out on 4/14, before the check even cleared. And if you
bothered to check before spewing off a malicious message, two of the boxes
already arrrived at your house today and were signed for at 2:45 pm(UPS #
1Z 010 X81 03 1279 704 1, 1Z 010 X81 03 1299 054 6). I emailed these
tracking #s to you on 4/14.

And Mr. Wilson, your shipment was delayed as the original box containing
both front and both rear seats was too large for UPS, and repacking them
held up shipment. I understand it is my fault for using the wrong size
boxes, and it took longer than it should have to repackage, but is a busy
time with people repairing their cars for summer, and I don't run a full
time business. If you want overnight service, get ready to pay for it and
call 928 International.
Also,I did not deposit your check until recently, and out of state checks
take 3-5 days to clear. The tracking # on your shipment is 1Z 010 X81 03
1299 093 9.

And sorry to annoy everyone with this post, this is definitely not a place
to discuss my or anyone else's business, but I had to set things straight.

(and if everyone is unsure of ordering from me, I would be happy to supply
the names and addresses of 100s of individuals who've done business with
me, I would give phone #s too, but I think people would find that
intrusive)
