Hello Gang:

I am sure someone else has had the thoughts of a "cloaking device" that
could easily be turned on and off and be visually and radar/laser
effective.  Sign me up for the next April Fools post describing this.  I
was ready to bite on the quad turbo 850 hp deal.

I was stopped by the Highway Patrol before the 88 S4 I was driving was
even my own!  About a half mile from my house too.  I bought it from a
local pal and he let me have it for a day or two.  Out for a quick test
drive one evening, I casually accelerated (really) up an on-ramp and
just as I was reaching the merge area, I saw an oncoming cruiser, at
which time my detector sang loudly.  I glanced down, and sure enough, I
was doing just over 80.  When he stopped me he mentioned that 75 would
have been on the edge for him (in a 65) but that 80 in the on-ramp lane
was a bit hot.  I smiled and graciously thanked him.  

Was it an omen?  Perhaps.  Was I put off?  Nah, no way!  What a beast!

The next day it had my plates on it and it has been over 19 months now
of HiPo free cruising.  My lawyer did the diversion deal which is now
long satisfied and my record is spotless.  Yes.

(I could be looking for some wood to knock on)

Congrats Moira on the great ride.  Enjoy the great weather but watch the
police action.
