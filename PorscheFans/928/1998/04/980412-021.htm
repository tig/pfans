    Hi fellow Pfans,
                            I hope you all had a pleasant Easter break. I
certainly didn't. After weeks of hot dry weather here Thursday it decided to
rain. My wife and I headed of to town in the 928s. About 5 miles from home
at an intersection an old pensioner in a Laser was stopped and preparing to
turn right across the traffic. He didn't see me coming and started to move
across, he travelled about 5 feet then saw me and stopped. Meanwhile I could
see what was about to occur and hit the brakes.The dry weather and the light
rain causes a deadly mix of slippery rubber shit on the road. The Porsche
locked up the wheels and went straight ahead, missing the Laser but going
straight over an island and taking out a "giveway"sign. You will all be
pleased to know the pensioner was unhurt.
    Then car finished up along the side of the road with a pool of oil
forming under the car. A traffic cop appeared less than 2 minutes after the
event ( he had just booked someone in the same spot a few minutes earlier).
    The damage done:
                                 Cracked nose cone, broken driving lights,
bent bonnet from the give way sign.
                                 Alternator and airconditioner ripped off
from leaping the island (the oil on the ground was from the filter, damaged
as the alternator went past). Chin spoiler, under tray, mounting brackets
for the compresser all broken. The two bolts on the lower control arms bent
back (front). The sump lost a bit of aluminium and the radiater is ok.
    The worst part is I don't have full insurance cover. I am a commercial
fisherman and its been a tough season. The police will send out a report in
a couple of days and I will decide what to do then.
    I should imagine the 928s will be a "hangar queen" for a few months.
    My wife and I both commented on how quiet and comfortable the accident
was.


            Regards,

             Graham Bates,  once pristine '82 928s euro, anniversary model.
Now reduced to driving my Holden one tonner (Chev 350,turbo 700, straight
Lpg). Perhaps there is a S4 nose cone update in my future.
