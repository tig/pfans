Howard!  We were pulling up to the shop just as you pulled
out and onto the highway!  Silver S4 right?

Heh heh, that message strikes fear to lessor cars around
here past midnight... I am more a nocturnal hunter I guess?

Actually my shark must have eaten something really bad the
night before as only half the engine is going now.  It
started fine (at 1pm), had a rough cold idle and I went to
the store.  By the time I came back (wife was sitting in the
idling shark) the idle was a mess - lumpy, missing, sick! 
What the ?  I barely made it home just a few blocks away. 
Tried some basic troubleshooting (breaking the condo rules
about no mechanical work in the garage area, yeah right)
which I already posted but no way the car is drivable until
fixed :( 

Now about beer night, I usually get there hours before
anyone so go figure what motivates me :) ?

I still need a volunteer to help me do A-B coil swapping but
soon point will be moot as I've ordered replacements from
Sonnen already.  Hope that's the fix!  Someone else had this
last year but I've forgotten the fix, wish it made it to the
FAQ, and hope the porschefans search engine gets approved
for release.

To add to my pain, over the weekend someone broke into one
of my 'outside' cars by smashing the window and ransacking
whatever I had in there.  Nice huh?  Second break in on that
one, it now has an alarm FWIW as it must remain on the
streets.  Another garage space would run me maybe $1700
annually, which is about what that car is worth dollarwise.  

Whups I am rambling!  Sorry...

Don't worry Howard, we will meet up sometime, there's lots
of stuff coming down the road as summer draws near!

Phil
