Hi Ross,

This is just a thought I haven't tried it myself so YRMV. How about putting
a coil spring inside the hose, then bending with heat. For small stuff you
could use screen door springs from the hardware store. For larger stuff
maybe a vacuum cleaner hose would provide support. Th spring would hold th
hose round while you heated and set it. 

Like I said, just a thought.

later
