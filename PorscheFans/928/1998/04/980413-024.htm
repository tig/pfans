	This is an added note about that rattling sound coming from my engine. 
	This is no longer a rattling sound, but a sound that is distinct like a
	pulley squeeking and rattling as it turns.

	[snip]
	The sound is coming from behind the area beneath the water pump and near
	the panels that cover what I think is the timing belt.  The engine only
	has 102,000 miles on it, but is it possible that it is a bearing in
	front of the crankshaft???  Perhaps a pulley bearing going bad??

	[snip]
	It seems to be coming from within the front of the engine....I am
	totally stumped!  If this is a problem I can fix myself someone please
	tell me, but if not then I think I will be taking it to the shop.

	Mark

	Your idler roller is shot.  I assumed you have an early MY 928.  Cost about $60
from the dealer.  While you're there, replace the timing belt too if it's about that time.
