I have read some comments about PSD in the group, but have not been abe
to resolve my questions about it.

so, I have three things I would like to get cleared up.

First, I have the PSD icon up on the drivers display and it says it's
disabled. well, once in a while, the little green light with PSD on it
comes on if  I drive on grass or wet roads. I tought this ment the PSD
was working ok. Is it?

Second, I thought I saw where threre was a resivour for fluid for the
PSD, and if it got low, it would cause the light to come on. If so where
is it, what do  I use, and how can I test the PSD to check it out?

Third, I have tried to reset the icon, but to no avail. I tried
disconnecting the battary for an hour or so, but no luck. The next step
is a $65 cost to the shop for them to reset it if everything else is
o.k.. any comments or suggestions?
