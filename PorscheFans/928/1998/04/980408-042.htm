I am currently working on somebody's 85 928 auto (32 v usa).

Looks like they ran it low  on oil and really screwed up the main bearings,
one of them spun, the thrust part of the bearings broke off and the whole
crank wore itself forward about 1/4 of an inch.  The crank counter weights
wore away, the block wore away.  The large piece that that makes up the
bearing caps is wore away. the fly wheel wore into some bolts behind it. 

It seems that maybe the most economical solution may be to get a good used
engine.  how much can this set a person back ( the cost of the engine +
shipping)?

Thanks 
Glenn

PS I'm glad this isnt my car! makes my problems seem trivial.
