I was having a problem of engine running rough, would not idle at all, kept
stalling.

I pulled off the plenums to check the spark plugs.  one of the small rubber
sleeves that connect the plenums to the runners had slipped off, probably
worked itsself off because the plenums move under hard throttle application.

When I pulled the plugs they were very black.  I cleaned them and started the
car.
It started right up, but it wouldnt quite run like it use to, so I drove it
around before I set the idle, there was a slight improvement. then it stalled
after idling for about 15 minutes and I tried to start it, after a while of
cranking, the tired battery was finished.  I bought a new 770 cca battery from
pepboys for 39.99, can you believe it?  Even if it dies in 1yr its probably
still worth it.

Tomarrow I will try to start it again.  My guess it may have a really dirty O2
sensor 
that is all sooted up like the spark plugs were. should I change it, will it
noticably improve my idle?

Thanks
