That still seems a fair price to me for a 5-speed (but no
test drive?  wow you are fearless!).  Have you ever seen a
$3,800 Ferrari or MB, etc. of the same vintage/condition?  
Hope there isn't too much more to make it streetable once
again.  What a great opportunity to as you say, live and
learn!  A big undertaking for the first time 928 owner but
try to watch the repairs if you don't get to do them
yourself.  It is a rare opportunity to see EXACTLY what the
fabled men of Weissach created and how/why things went
wrong.

Got a bigger budget?  In no particular hurry?  Then now is
the time to map maintenance and performance mods ie.
overbore/stroke, cams, mill head, install headers & exhaust,
etc.  

Check out my page for parts sources and ideas.  Again sorry
the car blew it's top on you but now you get a chance to
make things right, your way!

That's quite a list of vehicles, so I know you know what I
mean!

Good luck,
Phil
