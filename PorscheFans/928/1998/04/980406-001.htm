Having replaced my passenger side (left) electric window motor last 
weekend, I thought I'd post my experiences in the hope it will be of use 
to somebody.  It's not very technical I'm afraid, I'm a programmer not 
an engineer, and it may not be official Porsche procedure, but it 
worked...

First thing is - many thanks to the people who sent me details of 
stripping the door trim down - a complex business made easy with 
guidance.

I won't re-post this info here - if you need it, drop me a line.

Now to the window motor itself.  Having got all the trim off the door 
you'll notice there are three access holes into the door internals.  If 
this is the first time the door has been stripped (it was in mine), 
these holes will be covered by a polythene sheet glued to the door.  I 
ripped this off, presumably it's to stop grease and general gunk getting 
into the innards of the door trim, so you might want to preserve yours.

Through the holes you can see that the guide for the window motion is a 
greased vertical bar mounted centrally in the door, to which the bottom 
of the window is fixed by a running nylon clamp.  This clamp has a 
horizontal runner rail attached, within which runs a small wheel 
connected to the lift assembly.

The wheel itself sits on the end of an aluminium(?) arc with teeth on 
the outside edge.  This arc is what actually moves the window up and 
down and is guided by runners and a pivot.  The teeth engage in the cog 
on the motor, which is bolted to the assembly containing the arc.

To replace the motor you firstly have to unbolt this lift assembly from 
the door, since you can't get to the motor bolt heads without doing so.  
Firstly g-clamp the window in the fully up position with a clamp just 
under the nylon collar.  I used a small piece of foam around the 
vertical bar to prevent any g-clamp damage to an ideally low-friction 
surface.  If you don't clamp the window, it will drop down heavily once 
you unbolt the assembly as described below, you can guess how I know 
this...

Now pull the multiplug off the motor and unbolt the four bolt heads 
holding the lifting assembly to the door, these are obvious and between 
the access holes.  Mine were really torqued up, so you may need a torque 
wrench to do this.  As you undo the last bolt, hold the assembly through 
the hole furthest from the hinge, it's quite heavy with the motor 
attached.  Once undone, manoeuvre the assembly to an access hole so you 
can see the motor bolt heads.  All of this is done through the access 
holes, since the whole assembly is very awkward to remove completely (if 
possible?), but after some hand swapping and general limb gymnastics you 
should be able to hold the assembly with one hand and undo the motor 
bolts with the other, whilst simultaneously stopping the motor from 
dropping into the door!  You can slide the wheel at the end of the arc 
off the window runner rail to allow the assembly to rest in the bottom 
of the door to make it easier.

Once you've got the motor off, you can inspect it.  I'd got an assurance 
from Kelvin at "AFN Reading" (a really nice guy), that if I didn't need 
to use the £213 ($340) replacement motor, I could return it, but 
unfortunately I did as the cog was badly rusted and the motor very weak 
upon testing.  You can test the motor by refitting the multiplug and 
using the window switch.  Conventional wisdom might suggest that you 
have the battery disconnected while you're doing all this...I didn't and 
nothing bad happened,  and not doing so allowed me to test the motor and 
easily perform the adjustments required at the re-assembly stage.

Fitting the new motor is simply a matter of bolting it back on to the 
lift assembly (through the hole nearest the door hinge).  You may need 
to wiggle the thing a bit to get the cog to engage in the teeth of the 
arc.

Having done this you now have to bolt the lift assembly back on to the 
door and this is the tricky bit.  As you removed the motor, you will 
have probably moved the arc around it's pivot on the assembly and now 
having bolted the motor back on (and consequently locked the arc) and 
slid the wheel back into the runner rail, you are finding you can't get 
the bolt holes to line up in the door!  

This is where it pays to have the battery connected.  Refit the 
multiplug on the motor and whilst holding the lift assembly within the 
door in one hand, adjust the arc's position on the motor by stabbing the 
window switch to create tiny adjustments.  Don't overdo it as there is 
nothing to stop the motor strolling off the end of the arc, in which 
case you'll have to unbolt the motor again and move the arc back.  Bare 
in mind the motor should be roughly at the far end of the arc, since the 
window is already fully up.  This procedure should allow you to line up 
the lift assembly to the holes in the door and having done this you just 
rebolt and you're done.  Don't forget to take the g-clamp off the 
vertical guide bar and grease all visible parts while you're there.

Re-reading this, it sounds a bit complex at times.  I think it will be 
clear enough when you're actually doing it as the parts I've tried to 
describe will be right in front of you.
