Was the air temperature significantly colder as you climbed? 
That kind of problem is often brought on by the onset of cold
weather. Look for brake fluid (a)where the clutch actuating
rod goes through the floorboards, and (b)inside the clutch
housing - remove the rubber plug and stick a finger in there.
Chances are that either your master or slave cylinder was
leaking a bit. It doesn't take much, you may not even see
any difference in your brake fluid level in the reservoir.
