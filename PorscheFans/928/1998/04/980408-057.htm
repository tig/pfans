I apologize if this is "asked and answered", I read all my p-fans 928
digest messages weekly on Friday, so if's been covered since last Friday,
I'll look really lame.

Anyway, forging ahead blindly...

Warmer weather has arrived and upon leaving the dentist's office today, I
decided that the window down and the sunroof open still weren't cooling the
automobile operator enough, so I shut the openings, turned the dial to "1",
the temp slider down to 70 or so and pushed the A/C button in. The system
made its customary suction sound, which normally ends within a second and
the cold air starts flowing. Except today, the suction sound just
continued; as if whatever goal it has (shutting a door? generating nuclear
power?) could not be achieved.

I manipulated the items available to me (engine RPM, fan speed, CC setting,
radio volume, lane selection), all to no avail; if the A/C button is
pressed there is the persistent suction sound but no cold air. So I
re-opened the sunroof and the driver's window and made it home without
melting. Not that great a feat; temps weren't that high today. Would it be
that it could last!

What gives, shark fans? Is this a common/recognized problem, or have I
stumbled upon a new one? If it's recognizable, can I fix it? Can it be
fixed? Would a paint job help? I'm not the handiest of shark surgeons, but
I know which end of the screwdriver to point torward the wall (in case it
goes off).

TIA for any advice anyone can offer. BTW, I truly enjoy my Friday reading
of the digests. I sit in my office and occasionally hoot and holler, and
have a good time in general. Some of y'all are nuts.
