Well, I had to get my 'original Porsche' battery recharged for our
89 928. This resulted in power being removed from the 'anti theft'
equipped 'original Porsche' cd player. Once power was returned to the 
car I entered the 5 digit anti theft code but the unit would not respond to
it. Checked with the dealer and the car is on it's second 'original
Porsche' cd player and has a different anti theft code. I now have the
correct code but the cd player displays 'off'. The player docs say it needs
to be on for 24 hours before it will return to the mode where the correct
anti theft code may be entered.

So here's my question: Is the 24 hours continuious or cumulative. Can I just
leave the cd player turned on and once I accumulate 24 hours of on time
be able to enter to code or, should I go for a real long drive?
Cheers,
Jim
