Yes folks, it only took me 8 days to be pulled over by a high patrolman!
And believe it or not, it wasn't for speeding. Suspicion of a stolen
vehicle and no plates. The plates thing was my fault. I had the car
detailed and took the temp tag off so the back window could be cleaned.

That's probably not a record, but close! I thought I was emotionally
stable (not to mention mature) enough to handle my 928 responsibly, but
look no further than my race with a Boxster last Saturday for evidence
to the contrary. These cars do strange, but wonderful, things to our
psyches. As the Travolta character in "Broken Arrow" said, "Ain't it
grand!"

In your case, emotional maturity does not appear to be at issue, at
least not in light of the facts that you've revealed. I would hazard to
guess that perhaps the poor patrolman might have stopped you for more
personal reasons. Didn't anyone warn you of the effect on the opposite
sex of being seen driving a freshly detailed S4? For example, did the
officer ask for your address and phone number? I rest my case...

P.S. Especially watch out for "high" patrolmen.
