This is regarding Jason Wheeler's question about gas fumes.

My '86 developed a problem with fumes recently, too, especially as the weather has warmed up 
here in Virginia.   It would come and go.  The smell was not quite like raw gasoline, but had a 
"combusted" odor about it.

The problem was traced by my shop to a broken "Y" hose at the carbon canister, which I 
understand plays a role in recirculating gasoline fumes from the tank and possibly elsewhere.  
The canister is located near the right fender well.  They had to remove the fender liner to get 
to it.  

It took two hours of labor to trace this problem, as the source of fumes, just like water leaks, 
can be hard to detect.  The part itself, a "connector hose" with part number 92820121902, cost 
$1.90 and had to be special ordered.  Took a day.  The labor involved examining the air cleaner, 
removing the fuel pump cover, examing the fuel rails/hoses, and removing the wheel and fender 
liner.

No actual clues as to why it failed.  Possibilities are age, flexing, or even fuel from 
expansion or overfilling getting into the system and eventually causing deterioration.
