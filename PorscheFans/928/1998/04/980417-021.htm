Hello to all on this glorious spring day,

Been a while since I've posted (usually means the car is running smoothly).
But, alas, I have a couple of questions.  Frequently while driving with the
air/fan on one of the recirculating positions (i.e. other than 0).  The
strong smell of gas fumes engulfs the interior.  This is usually more
prevalent when driving hard or going around corners.  Also, it seems more
noticeable with the windows down(?)  Is it possible for a fuel line to have
leaked into the HVAC system?  My wife refuses to ride in the car until I
fix it.

Is there a particular point on the temp. guage that will trigger the
cooling fans?  I have the 16valve S engine and for as long as I have owned
the car, I have never actually heard the fan come on.  I know some of you
have the opposite problem where the fan won't shut off.  The temperature
has never risen above the second to last line on the guage, so maybe it
just hasn't gotten hot enough.  I have never had problems with overheating
so maybe I should just be happy.

One last observation, it is amazing how much a simple tune-up will improve
gas mileage.  I had been averaging only about 15 mpg in mostly highway
driving with some stop-and-go traffic.  Now after simply changing all
fluids and plugs and adjusting idle back to factory specs, the car is now
getting 19-20 mpg under the same driving conditions.  Anyone else have
similar gains?
