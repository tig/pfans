As I was sharking my way up Page Mill Road towards highway 280 this fine
Sat. morning, a Boxster burst past to enter the on-ramp ahead of me.
Rather rude, I thought, and in need of a refresher course in the cosmic
pecking order. I tucked in behind him and we both took the on-ramp curve
at the edge of adhesion. The Boxster immediately swung wide across all 4
lanes and took the long upgrade for all he was worth. I stayed to the
right, weaving back and forth between the 2 righthand lanes passing
slower traffic, peddle to the floor for perhaps a quarter mile. As I
crested the long hill, I looked for the Boxster and dutifully report to
you all that he was at least 200 yards or more in my wake, and acutely
aware that there was a swifter fish in the sea.
From memory, I know Boxsters are flat sixes, something like 240 bhp,
don't know curb weight but surely lighter. I really wasn't certain what
would happen when I decided to respond to his challenge. Suffice to say,
I enjoyed myself immensely. I was off at the next exit and as the poor
fellow plodded past, still in the fast lane, he exhibited the poor form
of failing to return my friendly wave. Honestly, I think some motorists
ought to be required to take lessons in etiquette before being allowed
to purchase certain cars.
