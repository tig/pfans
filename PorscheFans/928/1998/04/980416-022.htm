Brian - 

I saw a 928 in Granite Green one while on my recent search. It looks like
a dirty and oily metallic grey, not a dark metallic green. It's not like the
Jaguar grey-green which is a deeper, richer colour. In my opinion, the
Porsche granite green is not a nice colour, as it makes the car look
neglected. It doesn't sparkle the way all 928 paint should in order to
show off the curves. 

On the server glitch - I haven't received the digest this morning, but I'm
still a subscriber (apparently) and have been receiving the digest since
the recent hiccup which shows the number of list subscribers at around
56. Here's hoping!
