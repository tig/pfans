My 85 928S seems to run smoother for a while after the battery has
been disconnected for service.  After about an hour of running, it
seems to start loading up a bit (overly rich).  Are there any sensor
circuits that could produce this effect if faulty, or just the Control
Unit (pls. say it aint so!).

Also- I'm a bit puzzled by the configuration of the dash control
switches- Hazard is red, defrost is amber, A/C is amber, (HVAC is out
of svc), odometer reset is amber, but the headlight and fog light
switches are green.  Is this correct, or do I have a variety of
incorrect m/y switches?

Is there a purpose for the adjusting "wheel" under the dash on the
ignition switch side?  Seems like the companion to the dash light
rheostat on the left side of the pod.

Lastly- does anyone have a copy of the posting regarding the capacitor
replacement for the voltage meter?

I know my dash pos was replaced by P/O, and I'm trying to get
everthing to spec.
            Thanks for your patience and information
                 "still trying to sort it all out", its my first 928
