I protest!  Absolutely NO WAY should Howard have suggested that any 928 have
Gremlins of any kind.  Mega FLAMES, Howard!  I usually like reading your
comments, but now must suggest that you are NOT the purist that we have all
been led to believe.  I MEAN....GREMLINS.....REALLY.  You just lost 2500
originality points....

EVERYONE who has a 928, and truly knows the score, knows that you only
mention the name of those electrical idiosyncracies by their correct name,
and it must be in GERMAN.

Don't know the German word?    ....ask, oh, Leonard Laub....he knows all
that good stuff.  (A friend of mine knows his wife, and according to her,
Leonard has a 928 mantra that he recites in his sleep.  And, no, for you
hoons downunder, a 928 mantra is NOT some sort of souped up Holden.....)
