<<It appears I have a valve cover gasket leak and I do not know what the
tool is that will fit that trick fastener that holds the cover down. 
It looks like approx. 6mm allen but obviously that will not work. >>

You are on the right track!
All you need is a 6 mm Hex socket (available at your local friendly Hardware
store) .
They usually come for 3/8" drives. You'll need a 100 mm extension too or
longer.
While you are at it, get yourself a brand new gasket kit (cheap!) , and
replace them all.

Again the important part to ensure success is cleaning old stuf thoroughly and
ensure proper tightening sequence and torque for these bolts.

If you need the specifics, let me know. I don't have my ref. books with me
here.

Good luck.
