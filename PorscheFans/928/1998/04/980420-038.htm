I give up!.  The Squeeling from the front brakes won't go away!  Is there a
special trick or is this just one of those things you have to live with.  Here
are some of the things I've done:
     Replaced rotors and brake pads
     Installed anit-squeel pads on back of pads
     Installed "dampers" that were used on 928's of later models than mine
     Applied antisqueel to front (some sort of alcohol and graphite solution)
of pads
     Applied antisqueel to rear (gel stuff) of pads
     Rebuilt calipers
     Turned rotor and tried different brake pads (TWICE)
     Sanded off corners of brake pads
I noise is not near as dramatic as it was when I began this fight, but it is
still quit evident.  Any ideas, or is this just normal.
