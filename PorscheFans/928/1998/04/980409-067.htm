Hello all,
Gosh, I make one little post about a problem with my brake lights, and now
everyone's selling their cars!......Philip, I can understand not wanting to do
heavy mods to such a rare model as the SE.......(was that the
reason?)......congrats on the '87 S4......also congrats to Andy for snatching
it from you..... and David, I understand also - what with the house refinance
and all, but man, you guys are killing me.......I guess I just hate to see a
928 leave the loving arms of our list members here.
Perhaps, you guys thought "Ooooooh.......now Greg's having trouble with his
928!"
Please......stop the insanity.......It was only a bad brake light switch, and
surely no cause for a mass 928 exodus...... :-)
But seriously, even though I know we all have lives and our own priorities to
keep in order, it sometimes goes unsaid how great the comraderie on this list
is, and I just don't want to see anyone leave for good. (especially the
longtime torchbearing members....you know who you are) 
Though our hectic lives prevent full participation all the time, it is still a
source of lighthearted inspiration that I look forward to everyday. 

Regards to all,
Greg S.
