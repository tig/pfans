Jason,
99.9% chance that it is the "y" connection for your charcoal canister. This
is located in the front passenger fender well above and to the right of your
windshield washer reservoir, It is a common problem that I have seen on many
928s (just put one on my 85) and the symptoms are a gas smell under hard
acceleration (this is when the canister is purging itself) and is more
noticeable on the passenger side.

For some reason there are prone to break.

Remove right front tire ( jack up the car first)
Remove fender liner if so equipped
Look just up and to the right of the washer reservoir and you will see it,
it is held by 3 simple clamps and take a few minutes to change.

Part # 928. 201. 219. 02 Cost is around $2

The other odd chance is a leaking fuel line that goes from the passenger
side of the engine compartment over the valve cover to the fuel regulator
(there is a factory recall on those hoses)

My money is on the "y" connector
