Well after the recent work I did to get rid of some coolant leakage -
the car ran great for about a week.

I got a temp light and immediately pulled over  My temp guage was where
is normally is on a hot day (right about the middle) - I looked in the
return tank and the thing was empty.  - loosened the cap and got lotsa
steam and stuff. So I filled the tank with water I happened to be
carrying (expecting to have air pockets etc after having the cooling
system opened up in a few places) and got back int he car and the temp
was down just a little but the warn light didnt return. Maybe an air
pocket as I had anticipated? I put another 40 miles on the car that day
without worries.

Heres my larger concern - the last 2 times I started the car cold, the
idle has been extremely low (400-550rpm). The car is certainly not
lacking for power, and it doesnt die, but normally when cold this
vehicle runs at about 1500 and drops slowly as it warms up. (in 1-2
minutes) - I had removed a temp sending unit and put thread tape on it
and replaced the aluminum ring - but I put it back on carefully and this
particular problem didnt immediately appear - the car has been on about
4 or 5 trips since then. Does this sound like a likely culprit? The
wires heading to the temp sending unit were rather aged - this thing
screws in straight down just fore and left of the oil filler. Its under
quite  a few vacuum lines and oil breathers, but it is there
nonetheless.
