I remember a PCA tech session I attended about 10 yrs. ago in N.J. on 
concours prep.  It was at John Paterak's shop and he did several demos.  
One I remember was for removing light scratches from the car.  He used 
2000 grit wet sandpaper (available at body/paint supply shops) to 
carefully wet sand an area (after which it looked totally dull and 
"ruined" to my eyes), which he followed by 3M Imperial Hand Glaze (which 
brought back the shine), and then wax.  Looked beautiful!  If you try 
this, obviously try a small inconspicuous area first and watch those 
edges!  Should remove your swirl marks too.  Gonna be a LOT of work 
though to do a whole car...

You might want to give John Paterak a call first to check on this.  He 
might even have a new method now, or one more specific to your problem.  
He's the PCA technical chairman for Paint, Bodywork, Restoration, etc.  
You can find his number in Panorama on the Q&A page in the little box.  
If you can't find it let me know and I'll get it for you.
