Hey everyone,

Just a funny story that happened this past January that I have yet to tell to
everyone.

I had just got my GTS in and wife and I went to Baskin Robins for some Ice
Cream (they did not have my Chocolate Fudge however, so I was pissed).  I
pulled into the handicapped spot right in front and wife went inside while I
took my time to get my wheelchair out.  I was about half done and I see a cop
getting out of his mid '80's Vette.  He glares at me as he walks past the back
of the car as he did not see my wheelchair at first and the car still had
paper plates on it.

He gets inside and makes some comment about the white car outside and my wife
says that is my husbands car and he quickly says how nice it looks, blah,
blah, blah.

I get settled in my chair and roll inside and order a cone and the wife and I
share a large table.  The officer and I talk while he is ordering and he sits
down w/ us when his cone is ready.

We have a very nice chat and at some point in the conversation he says to my
wife, "so where is your car (refering to a Porsche for her)" and we say in
unison, "it is at home in the garage."  He thought we were kidding and when we
assured him that we were not he said, "well that is just a disgusting display
of wealth."  I think he was only half kidding, but it sure was funny, and I
told him that as a drug dealer I needed a nice car like that.  He caught on to
that one right away and asked what pharmaceutical company I worked for.

Anyway, the his and hers comment reminded me of the story.  Hope you enjoyed
it, I know we did.

Hope to see you all soon,
