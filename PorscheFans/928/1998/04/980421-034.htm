Jay Kempf asked about the washer systems - On my '86S, the headlight
washer and the windshield washer don't share any plumbing except for the
hookup at the resevoir. There are two separate pumps. The pump is more
easily accessed by taking the fender liner out.

Jim Cain asked about a fuse chart - Ask your dealer, and they will
normally make you a copy of the fuse chart.

Todd Mauerhan asked about brake squealing - One old brake shop trick to
stop squealing is to drill a staggered series of small holes into the
friction material on th pads, then inser HB drafting lead and break off
flush with the pad surface. You end up with little graphite bars
embedded in the pad surface. These are supposed to spread a little
graphite on the pad to changge the stick-slip characteristics of the pad
and prevent squeal without changing the friction characteristics too
much. Some cauution is advised!

Jim Hall mentioned applying tape to the threads on a fitting - After
some bad experiences on race cars, we no longer use teflon tape for
automotive plumbing. Too much chance of having small threads and bits of
teflon floating around screwing things up.

I told about finding a restricted vacuum check valve on my '86S. I drove
the car today, and the cruise control works! In fact, when I turned it
on, it snatched the throttle down right smartly - I had never felt it
move before! In addition, the HVAC flaps move with an audible "thunk!",
which had never happened before. If you are having the usual HVAC /
cruise control vacuum problems, try either cleaning or replacing the
check valve near the brake booster.
