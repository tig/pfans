Eric,

Your new car has 24k on it and the warantee company will cover you for
another 36k, bringing total mileage to 60k.  At that point you'll be due
for the car's major tuneup which won't be covered by the warrantee.

Several of my 928s had less than 20k on them when I bought them.  I can't
recall spending even half the $2500. warrantee fee, on any of them until
they had over 75k on the clock.  If it were me, I'd keep the money and risk
not needing it.  The odds are greatly in your favor.

Gene O'Rourke
