I am having trouble with my 1983 928 S, i have been hearing a noise, sounds
like it is coming from the back of the engine compartment but not really sure,
but it sounds like a clicking sound, almost like a marble is in a small tube
with air blowing into it making the ball hit the walls creating a chattering
sound...sorry for the discription.
Is this the throwout bearing? Hope that it's not clutch replacement time. The
car also has not been running very well, when accellerating, it seems to
hesitate a lot, and isn't very smooth, again clutch? or something else...

All help is always appreaciated and helpful.
