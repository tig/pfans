Dear Fellow "Land Shark" tamers:
                                   928 Frenzy Zwei
     
     The second 928 technical event and gathering, organized by the Potomac 
     Region of PCA, is set for September 26, 1998. This year, the host site 
     will be "AutoThority," in Fairfax, VA. ("AutoThority" is located about 
     15 miles west of Washington, DC.)
     
     For out-of-town attendees, a special hotel room rate will be available 
     for 9/25-27/98. Only 20 rooms have been set aside for us in this three 
     star hotel, so act fast to get one of them. On 9/25/98, at 7:00 p.m 
     until 10:00 p.m. there will be a casual "Frenzy Reception" in a 
     hospitality suite at the hotel. The reception will feature light 
     snacks and beverages. The cost for it is $10 per person. Come meet 
     some of the other 928 afficionados in a relaxed and comfortable 
     atmosphere. Also, the hotel is adjacent to the parking lots where the
     9/27/98 activities will be held. (See the sixth paragraph.)
     
     If you missed last year's event, you must not miss this one. Last 
     year's was well attended, but this year's promises to be bigger and 
     better. It is very likely that it will exceed the number of attendees 
     (82), and the number of 928s (47) that showed up last year.
     
     Kim Crumb (PCA's 928 model expert) will pick up where he left off last 
     year to lead the technical discussion. It will start at 9:00 a.m. and 
     (except for a few short breaks) will continue, until 4:00 p.m. During 
     lunch, Larry Reynolds (Car Care Specialties) will conduct a "928 care 
     and cleaning demo." Several 928 technical experts and vendors of 928 
     literature, parts, maintenance items, and performance enhancement 
     equipment will be on hand.
     
     Registration for the "928 Frenzy" is $20 for PCA and 928OC members, 
     $25 for all others. Lunch and snacks (with beverages) are included in 
     the registration fee. Also, registrants get one free event "T"shirt per

     couple if they register by 8/29/98. Shirts are $15 each ($17 for XXL.)
     
     For those of you that need more than one day of intense 928 activities,
     the following day (9/27/98) there will be an optional low-key 
     "Concours d' Elegance" and an "Autocross." "Frenzy" registrants will
     only have to pay $10 for each of these events instead of the usual $15.
     
     For a registration form, or for more information, contact: Ed Ruiz, 
     426 Old Dominion Ave., Herndon, VA 20170, (703)481-9252 before 10 p.m. 
     eastern, or send an e-mail request to: eds928s@erols.com
