I was an aeronautical eng.  lots of strengh and materials classes.  =

before i get out my books , I think 15-90 degrees is imaginable, but not =

720degrees.
2 revoloutions , think for a moment the forces.  the engine can only
generate =

500 ft lbs of torque. (that includes the clutch dumping at 4krpm at max
torque which is the same as stepping on it in 4th at 4krpm) =

 you use a 100 just to tighten your lugnuts.!!

In a mustang over 8 or 10 times can be generated due to the gearing of th=
e
transmission
 before the drive shaft  .thats 5000 ft lbs of torque.     Hello, are you=

followning me or am I missing something.
Please tell me because as an engineer , I love to learn.
Are you a mechanical engineer?,  if not explain to me how a guy that can
bench press 100 lbs on a 5 foot wrench
can twist a 3"diameter drive shaft..  Give him a 50 foot wrench and thing=
s
could change.  =

Im using math again, so watch out.
Also, I just thought of something.  why the 928 engine doesnt rock or
rotate when you step on it.    all that torque from a mustang =

engine and transmission has to be countered right?  the trainny and engin=
e
are one.
in a 928 however, the engine has to only be supported for the 500 foot lb=
s
it can produce, the tranie, carries the wieght of countering the 5000 foo=
t
lbs the gearing delivers.  =

Put that in your educated pipe
Mark
