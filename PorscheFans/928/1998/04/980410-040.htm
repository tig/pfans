I am the very proud 2nd owner of a 90 928GT with on 9500 miles. It's been
in storage  for the last 5 years and drive very little before that. The
original owner bought it new in chicago, drove it to calif. with his new
bride and had it shipped to Maui, drove it around a little and put it in
storage in his garage. I think it sat mainly because the A/C didn't work.

The cars black or black and you just gotta have A/C in Maui!  The belt was
off the a/c compressor, I thought it was going to be an easy fix, well the
a/c clutch was fried, the compressor seemed fine (only had a few thousand
miles on it) it turned smooth and had good suction so I opted to replace
the clutch only. I spent the last 3 weeks tracking down a new a/c clutch.
Last night I installed the new clutch and compressor using new "O" rings &
all new belts (the belts were fine, just thought i might as well replace
them. All went great and today I ran the car in to our local auto A/C shop
for charging. The system checked out good with no leaks, BUT for some
reason no power is getting to the clutch or high pressure switch. the #37
fuse is OK.  The A/C shop has no wiring diagram on a 928 and has no idea
where the problem might be.

Can anyone give me an idea of what might be causing this problem, or where
to start looking? It's HOT on Maui ....you gotta have A/C in a Black 928!

Aloha...........Dan
