Kevin don't feel too bad, I too have had a problem with Mr. Hatziiliades...
I ordered some tires and rims from him and sent him Two checks,(The first
one he said that he never recieved. I think this was a ploy to stall for
time.......) I fedex'd him a check three weeks ago and also have not been
able to contact him. He never answers his pages.... and all he has is a
message machine.......He too has cashed my check and it has cleared his bank.

I hope all of us on the list were not "duped."

If anyone has a good number for him please let the list know.......
