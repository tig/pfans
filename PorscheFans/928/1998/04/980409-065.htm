Along with the spring feul injection flu that seems to be going
around:
(I think my car had it first and might have been the vector- sorry!)

After a heated "sorting out" session with a black convertible mustang
cobra, I was cruising along in fifth at about 2800rpm, when all of
sudden the tach needle spiked for just a second.  About two minutes
later same thing- bounced up 1/2 to one gradient on the dial and fell
right back down!  No corresponding surge in power or discernible
change in tone of engine.

However, The Cobra kindly let me fly off into the distance (in front
at least) with my tail between my tires as the 928 definately came up
short yet again in the HP/torque department.

Any ideas?  The engine did feel a tad rough, but not really skipping.
If its jsut electrical, where do I look for the leads?

New/Recent:  plugs, wires, cap, rotor, t-belt, etc.

TIA
