Any 928 should run happily on unleaded fuel. However, there were no
Australian or Euro two-valve engines specified for it. The US and Japan are
the only markets which got a two-valve 928 engine specified to run on
unleaded fuel (non-premium). Those markets got a four-valve engine
specified for premium unleaded fuel in '85. In '86-88, Australia got
four-valve engines specified to run on non-premium unleaded fuel. In '87,
all non-Oz markets got the S4, whose engine runs on premium unleaded fuel.
Oz joined the rest of the world in '89.

>What happens to the valve gear when it runs on unleaded.

On a 928, probably nothing. Some older cars depend on lead to lubricate the
valve gear (and so need a fuel additive), but the 928 engine was designed
to go to markets where leaded fuel would not be available.

unleaded?

If it's not a US- or Japan-spec car, correct operation. It's designed for
high-octane fuel.

Same thing. 1984 928 S cars not intended for the US or Japan have the same
LH-Jetronic engine control system used in all later cars; this includes the
knock sensor and the ability to adapt to inferior fuel.

>I would buy this car if I could be assured of it running on lead free fuel.

No problem, as long as the fuel is high octane (e.g., 98 RON). Mark DaVia
of this list has a very similar car, operating very happily (and winning
races, even with its automatic transmission) on unleaded, which is all you
can get here.

Highly real. Even though a non-US '84 928S and an Oz '88 S4 have similar
peak horsepower ratings, the S4 engine has more displacement and a lot of
clever features which deliver lots of torque from 3000 rpm up. The earlier
engine is much peakier and needs to wind up to deliver its maximum punch.
