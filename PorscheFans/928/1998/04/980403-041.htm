I know someone out there knows the answer to these questions so here goes,

What 2 valve per cylinder vintages (Australian delivery i.e. Eurospec) of
928 run on unleaded? What octane of unleaded do they need? What happens to
the valve gear when it runs on unleaded. What happens if a 928S whithout a
knock sensor is run on high octane unleaded?

An almost complete answer to this question was recently given to this group
when a member explained that his 1985 SOHC Australian model had a knock
sensor and adjusted ignition advance according to the knock characteristics
of the fuel supplied to the engine. What about 1984 vintage, please?

There is this sexy black 1984 model that belongs to a friend and sits in his
garage gathering a fine coat of dust. This is a really healthy and happy
car. It starts and runs beautifully has perfect external and internal
cosmetics and has never given any trouble. Sadly it gets a run at most twice
a year. I would buy this car if I could be assured of it running on lead
free fuel.

Now you opinions please. Recently I had a ride in the above mentioned 1984
928S and a 1988 928S4 both were auto. (and black, so that variable is out of
the way ;-)  )

They seemed somewhat different in character. Is this me, or variations in
the state of the individual cars, or is it real? 

thanks in advance
