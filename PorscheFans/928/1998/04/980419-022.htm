Hello Gang:

Here's an easy one for most of you.  I would like input because
something is not right here and it could be dearly related to my
safety.  Out for a ride with a friend and Porsche admirer, the brakes on
my 1988 S4 (88,000m) are put to the test by this fellow.  He basically
simulates an emergency stop at about 50 then 70.  He was surprised that
the brakes didn't lock up.  Nor was there any sign of ABS trying to kick
in.  That's why he did it again at 70 mph, the brakes work well enough
to stop quite nicely (especially at 50), but the pedal goes very slowly
on down (with full leg on the pedal) when it should feel firm enough to
lock them up and at least invoke the ABS pedal chatter.  I get in my car
and it does the same thing.  I hadn't even noticed this in normal or
even spirited driving, never a need to jam the brakes all the way.  The
smell of fish wafts into the nostrils. 

First thing Monday, it will go in for a change to Super Blue brake fluid
and do a thorough bleed.  It was time for this service anyway. 
Obviously all components will be inspected for leaks or wear.  Doesn't
this have rather serious possible implications?  Does this happen
often?  I have owned an 81 928 for 16 years now and the brakes are far
less then the S4 setup, but the pedal has never acted like this!  I know
it has ABS as I have felt it on slick streets, but nothing there today. 
I wondered if the ABS has malfunctioned.  But still the pedal is not
right.

Any thoughts?  Perhaps it would be a good idea to simulate an emergency
stop every now and then in safe conditions just to be sure it's there
when you might really need it.  I would be interested to find out how
other's cars handle this.  So might you.

Thanks,  Marc White  81 928   88 928 S4
