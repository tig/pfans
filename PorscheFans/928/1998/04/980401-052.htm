I have seen the future, and it comes in 4s...

 Well, this weekend I got a call from an old friend of mine who connected 
me with a true car nut.  Among his many odd but very interesting vehicle 
collection, was his latest "creation" -- a quad turbo 928 conversion.  
Yes, that is FOUR tiny IHI turbos.  This guy is a master with a TIG, and 
previously did all sorts of custom aircraft engine modifications.  Each 
turbo "set" consisted of a staggered set of turbos, in a sequential-boost 
arrangement. Everything looked like it was right out of a NASA 
experimental hydrazine engine.
 EVERYTHING has been modified, down to the engine mounts.  It would take 
many pages to describe all the changes, and upgrades, so I took MANY 
pictures (will post ASAP).   One thing that did stick out was that 
everything had been nickel-something-alloy plated and polished to a 
mirror-finish.  He said he had a patent on the plating process, and had 
licensed it to all the major aerospace companies (it was obvious this was 
where he was making all his money).  Interestingly, the rods were made 
from *carbon fiber*.  He showed me one of the early protos--unbelievably 
light, like 40 grams!! (w/o bearings).  This is compared to 800 grams 
stock.  All retainers, clips, etc. were titanium.  He had the crank made 
from billet steel, lightened, and internally balanced (no harmonic 
balancer needed). The flywheel was also made of carbon-fiber.  
Compression ratio was set at 12.5:1.  Displacement was *7.27* Liters (!). 
 Heads were NOT O-ringed, he had welded in an aluminum "webbing" to help 
stabilize the sleeves during high-rpm "ringing."
 He said the engine's red-line was over 9,000 rpm. (Geez.)  He had not 
dyno'd it yet, but he said it was probably around 850hp, 950 ft-lbs 
torque.  Wow.
 I'll get a complete list of everything that was done later this week.  I 
casually asked him what this would cost me to replicate, and he just 
laughed. I can't wait to drive it thing this weekend.
 He said his next "project" was to retrofit a small GE Turbine --2,000 
BHP in another 928.  He said the biggest problem was going to be "finding 
a transmission to handle the power, but also be small enough to fit under 
the car."
