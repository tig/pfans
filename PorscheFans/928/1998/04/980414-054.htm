David,

Re: your post on MIME messages.  I think you missed my point.  When you and
I corresponded on this subject a month or so ago.  I fessed up to you that
my technical knowledge of computers is scant.  You were kind enough to take
the time to explain the solution to my problems regarding MIME, and also
the fact that my computer had crashed and I had lost an immense amount of
work and other data due to my failure to back up my work frequently.

However, your post today regarding the many merits of MIME etc. pretty much
explains the reason that I spent a couple of years in the Silicon Valley
area translating techie talk into language the average intelligent person
who is not a computer professional can understand.

Its' plain to me from your messages regarding the above that you are
knowledgeable on this subject far beyond the point that I ever will be, or
even care to be. 

For my purposes, computers are wonderful tools to research information,
save a huge amount of time over using a typewriter or one of the early word
processors,  an incredible means of communicating with spirits, kindred, or
otherwise, globally, at almost no cost, and the ability to do some
relatively simple graphics. They have changed my way of doing business
incredibly these past few years.

However, I left the engineering profession in 1967 when computers resembled
small apartment buildings.  I really don't have the desire or  the time to
involve myself with all the technical minutiae or the mechanics of the
zillion various software packages on the market.

We live in a society where the average person doesn't know how to program
their VCR, or even stop it from eternally blinking 12:00.  When both
hardware and software design finally reaches the true definition of "Plug
and Play", computer sales will skyrocket beyond Bill Gates wildest
fantasies.  I'm not implying that members of this list are amongst the
group mentioned above, but whenever we have one of our frequent power
outages here in south Florida, I have to get the manuals out to reprogram
the VCR and several other pieces of equipment.  This coming from a guy who
designed much of the ground support systems for the Saturn/Apollo missions.
 How do you think the average lawyer, accountant, or marketing executive
feels about this?  

Your knowledge of computer mechanics awes me.  I just want a machine that I
can communicate with, research material for articles and/or books with, and
save a whole lot of time by not having to use "white out" to cover my
sloppy typing.  And, I  want to be able to do those things without having
to go back to school to get a  Masters in Computer Sciences to do it. I'm
not putting you down  in any way.  I truly respect your technical knowledge
and appreciate the help you  gave me.  I just think that at times, people
who work in the computer industry take for granted the idea (not fact),
that the average computer buyer
understands what they're talking about.  Most of us don't.

Regards

Gene
