I had fun today in my work wagon- drizzly day, up a steep SF
hill, parking brake as full on tight as I could, floor that
little a/t FWD 4-banger and smoke 'em up!  It must the
weather, went a little stir crazy!  Many tourists wondering
what in the hell?  One took my picture as I gave the thumbs
up during the one-wheel burner.  LOL!  Over the crest
must've looked funny to the camera crew down a couple of
blocks, glad the motorcycle cops didn't care.

Oops, uh, what were we talking about?

How much for the bridge?  Oh, that was yesterday!
