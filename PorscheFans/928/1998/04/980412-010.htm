Question:  If the fuse blanks in my fuse box were empty, and the
indicated
position wouldn't make the wiper work anyway, why would the NEXT blank
work.
AND, how could the wiper work at all, before the fix.  Worked all last
summer and into the winter before giving up?

Roger:

I've got one word for you : "Gremlins". What else could explain 60-80%
of the anomalies we all periodically experience? Be nice to them. When
you skin your knuckles on a tough bolt, don't curse, they might think
you're angry with them. Right now, they're pumping out heat in my car
even though both the temp. selector and the fan are at lowest settings.
But am I angry? No way. I just fed the shark a MB 560 SL and thanked my
gremlins for allowing me the pleasure.
