I have enjoyed my "new" 88S4 for a whole week now and would like to comment
on some of the recent posts.

I was used to getting a lot of looks/compliments on my 84 rubinrot 928, but
now since I've had the Silvermettalic 88 around town for a week I'm amazed
at how the silver P-car gets noticed. I was never really a big fan of silver
until I saw the S4. It looks so classy. That S4 rear end/spoiler is baaaad! 

I too am a member of the A/C problem with the S4. The '84 A/C works so well
that some of my female passengers bitch (too harsh?) about it. It gets
downright cold in the '84 but the '88 has some problems (leaks). Not summer
yet here so it can wait while I bond with the new beast. 

There is nothing like opening the garage door and seeing two 928s and those
fat back tires! A true sharks den.

Oh, while I'm wasting bandwidth, Jumpin Jack Flash somehow makes my right
foot get heavy. It's a gas, gas, gas.

FWIW,
