I have always read the computer related stuff on this list with great fear
and trepidation.

I own several computers and use them for various things....gradually, I have
become able to do a few things with them with some reliability.  I am no
longer like the cartoon of the little duck, standing in front of a computer
terminal with a humongous mallet raised above his head; the caption reading:
"Strike any Key when ready."

But the thought of reprogramming the computer in my 928 makes me wake up in
the middle of the night, screaming hysterically, while dripping sweat.

So also, the thought of having to buy a more sophisticated EMAIL program.
Gadzooks!  What the internet guru GAVE me will HAVE to do.

So, reading about Gene's email difficulties and solutions this morning, plus
all the cross posts to the same subject, made me VERY happy for my own,
simplistic, vendor supplied Eudora version 1BC, or whatever.

Truly folks, I am VERY glad that all your email problems are yours, and not
....ah...MIME.

Getting ready to travel, but NEEDED this.
