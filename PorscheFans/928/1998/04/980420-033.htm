Get a can of oil flush from your local auto parts store.  When I've done
it,
the process has been something like:

1.	warm up engine
2.	pour a can of flush into the old oil
3.	run for about ten minutes
4.	drain completely
5.	change the filter
6.	put in fresh synthetic.

Never had a problem, done it on many cars, including my 105K miles 1982.
