I am thinking of ride height adjustment, but have
no idea whether the rear sag that I believe has
developed is real or not.  Can anyone tell me
where they are supposed to sit (stock springs and
Boge shocks at this point, although I am going to
Koni and new coils eventually)?  The fender
above the front wheel center sits at 24.25 inches
and the back sits at 23.5 inches above the rear
wheel (tires 225/50 16).  I have a feeling they
should be equal, but you could drive for a year in
my area and never see another 928 to measure.  

(Re: isolation
In fact, the problems with other drivers here are a
little different than the problems described by
Jordan Rautiola.  Here, the activity in the other
vehicle would be along these lines: "Lawd mercy,
Fern, whatchell is that thang, one a them sport
cars we hear tell of up to Calgary? Like to scare
the shite outa the horses, all shined up like a
nickel.  Get close n see ifn I can huck some
tabaky juice on it.")
