Hey Del -

Don't even worry about it!  So I get to play McGyver at the
side of the road every now and then (thank god for bungee
cords).  I am and remain fascinated by the 928.  Someday I
sure hope to strip one down to the bones like Marc's doing
right now, then put it back together bigger, stronger, able
to eat road like never before!  Carpets?  We don't need no
stinking carpets!  Windows? ....

Dragging the car definately wasn't in the design plans and
I've only done one run on the GT (witness my crappy
timeslip).  I'm sure the gearbox will hold at stock power
levels for at least a season or two but the smart racer will
open it up before trouble appears.  I think it should take
the other events just fine if the factory desert and snow
testing is any indication.  Let's here it for Munga too.

Got Nomex?  ;)

oh yeah ps. for those who haven't visited the site lately,
believe it or not I've been updating Vol. 2!  Tons more to
go, I think I need a moratorium on new pix until I can catch
up.  Heck I've got stuff I can't piece back to the right
owners anymore!  Everybody switch keys!

To be continued...
Phil
