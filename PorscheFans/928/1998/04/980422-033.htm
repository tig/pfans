Hello David:

I saw your post wondering about the purchase and maintenance involved in
928s and if you are thinking the normal costs associated with the care
and feeding of 928s makes them not worth it, you are definately asking
the wrong gang.  My answer, like 99% of the others on the list that LOVE
these cars is, HELL YES!  Get a 928.  Shop around, drive them, learn
about them...you'll love them too, they are a stinking supercar at Ford
Escort prices.  Yes, plan to spend bucks, why not?  You bought the thing
for $40,000 less than they cost new (in some cases nowadays) so you have
got some room to make the car right for you.  It is a good idea to go
through someone who knows these cars and that can advise you properly. 
Talk to Brian Buxton.  Find a good impartial 928-smart mechanic that can
look over any service records and perform a pre-purchase inspection for
you.  Ask this list what the menbers think of the car you eventually
find.  There are dozens, if not hundreds, of helpful and carings
individuals that would be glad to welcome another into the fold.  We
know what we have.

I have owned an 81 for 16 years now and it has been my daily driver
quite often.  It hasn't cost me very much at all because I have kept it
right and like it that way.

I bought an 88 S4 (get one of these, I recommend it highly!) and I paid
a pal $20,000 for it in a second.  It has taken me about $4,000 to make
it right for me and it is a superb piece of machinery that is totally a
blast to drive.  Every time I get in it I am surprised and pleased. 
That still goes for the 81!!

I will forward a post I put on the list in Nov. when I first heard about
PorscheFans that also addresses some of this, "Why the 928?" question.  

Get one, you'll see.

Best regards,  Marc White  81 and 88 S4

p.s.  If you study and drive 928s for four months, you will know what to
do.  If you are afraid of the maintenance or want a worry-free car, quit
whining and get another Honda or a Toyota...or a new VW bug.  Jeez, a
928 S4 supercar (ready for just about any race track) or a VW
bug...Hmmmm...let me think...
