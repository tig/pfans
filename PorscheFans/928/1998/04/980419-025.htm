Its the combination airbag dispenser and horn button. Also its One More 
Thing To Be Covered With Leather And Cause Owners To Spend Weekends 
Recovering. You know if you just don't touch it, the leather lasts 
longer?

Mine's obviously broken. It twists when its bumped. And my petals are
broken too, they depress when I rest my feet on them. What good are foot
petals if they won't stay put? The one on the right is really broken.
When pressed it alters the tune of the muffler and causes the muffler to
emit louder noises. Obviously the car doesn't like me to rest my foot 
on the right petal as when I do, the car sucks me tighter into the 
seat, trying to pull me away from that obviously sensitive place. Have 
never had another car as sensitive as my 928S.
