The passenger side windshield washer nozzles on my car will leak and dribble
out some washer fluid after a bit of spirited driving.  What this does of
course , is mess up the area with little streaks, water spots, etc.  This is
quite annoying after one has spent  2 or 3 hours cleaning and polishing.

My question is quite simple, there must be a check valve in the system to
keep this from happening.  I have not found any reference in the shop
manuals relative to this subject.  If anyone would have a cure, I would be
most happy to hear of it.

Not sure on an '88 but on my '83, I need to remove the whole plumbing within the hood in
order to replace the check valves.  Cost about $2 each from the dealer and if I remember
correctly, there are four.  The job isn't bad, just takes alot of patience.  You should
see two access hole underneath the hood.  Remove them and you'll have access to the
nozzle.  From there it's self-explanatory.  Found that both my nozzles was clogged too, so
I put them in boiling water for a few minutes and that took care of it.
