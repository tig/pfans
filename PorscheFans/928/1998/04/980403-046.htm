    The second 928 technical event and gathering, organized by the Potomac
Region of PCA, is set for September 26, 1998. This year, the host site will
be "AutoThority," in Fairfax, VA. ("AutoThority" is located about 15 miles
west of Washington, DC.)
    If you missed last year's event, you must not miss this one. Last year's
was well attended, but this year's promises to be bigger and better. It is
very likely that it will exceed the number of attendees (82), and the number
of 928s (47) that showed up last year. 
    Kim Crumb (PCA's 928 model expert) will pick up where he left off last
year to lead the technical discussion. It will start at 9:00 a.m. and
(except for a few short breaks) will continue, until 4:00 p.m. 
During lunch, Larry Reynolds (Car Care Specialties) will conduct a "928 care
and cleaning demo." Lunch and snacks (with beverages) are included in the
registration fee. Also, the first 60 to sign up will get an event 
"T"shirt. Several 928 technical experts and vendors of 928 literature,
parts, maintenance items, and performance enhancement equipment will be on
hand.
    For those of you that need more than one day of intense 928 activities,
there will be an optional low-key "Concours d' Elegance" and an "Autocross"
the following day (9/27/98). "928 Frenzy" registrants will receive $5
discount coupons for each of these events. Registration for the "928 Frenzy"
is $20 for each PCA member and $25 for each non-members. For a registration
form, or for more information, contact:
Ed Ruiz, 426 Old Dominion Ave., Herndon, VA 20170, (703)481-9252 before 10
p.m. eastern, or send an e-mail request to: eds928s@erols.com

I would like to let Nigel know that what he experienced is called TTO or
"Trailing Throttle Oversteer." Sometime it's called lift throttle oversteer.
Basically, it's when you enter a turn (or bend) at or near the tires limits
of adhesion and trail off the gas or (worse) onto the brakes. The weight of
the car is then shifted towards the front which takes traction away from the
rear tires. The result is the desire for the rear of the car to come around
towards the front. TTO is more pronounced in a rear engine rear wheel drive
car (like a 911) than on a 928. However, it is still possible to do in any
Porsche, and in some cases it is desired, but in street driving it is
usually not something one wants to happen. To achieve TTO is very easy. To
control TTO takes practice, practice, and more practice. I suggest that you
should try to experience it at least once, but do it in a controled
situation, like an empty parking lot or at an autocross.

Happy motoring. Ed
