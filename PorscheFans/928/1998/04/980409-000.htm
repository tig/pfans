I stand (sit) corrected - I should have mentioned that the article in Trading
Post indeed said that there were five on the PCGB Register, although it
was likely there are others in the UK. As to the ones that you have come

I saw your post on attendance at the swapmeet the weekend after next.

but perhaps a gathering at some stage during the summer might provide
another opportunity to meet....
