Hi David:

Thanks for the post - I was following the service manual
procedures.  It is still interesting and curious to me,
although I did note earlier that even if the part metered
out ok it was no indication that it was actually working. 
This is the first completely dead 928 coil I've seen, the
other one had zero meter readings off the leads and wires
even but the car idled and ran 95%, only with major
stuttering under full throttle.  

Is the compound inside the coil corrosive/toxic?  Or even
explosive?  I might get curious enough to saw the thing
open.

Inquiring mind wants to know!
