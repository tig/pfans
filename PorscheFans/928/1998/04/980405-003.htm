Ha!  I would've done the same thing, if only to see if was

Nice way of saying it plowed it's way over or the driver
lost nerve to hold inside line?

Up a hill?  Sounds like the Boxster will be history soon...

They are neat cars.  I'm getting more used to them now and
they definately take the cake among the other new drop tops
ie. Z3 (blech)  MB roadster (looks better going than coming
IMO) new Miata (still weak-kneed).  Well, that new Jag is
winner too!  But the Boxster still needs somewhere to mount
an intercooler(s) (hint hint) and I can't imagine a
whale-tailed Boxster.

Maybe shoulda' given him the L.A. style Welcome to
California wave, usually elicits a response!  Just joking!


No shark stories from me tonight, just took it easy all
night.  I think I gapped my plugs too wide at 35's it seems
to stumble a bit when cold at low revs, then clears up when
warm.

Hmm.

Good post Howard - I hope Marc will give you a ride in the
white car tomorrow or at least fire it up!
