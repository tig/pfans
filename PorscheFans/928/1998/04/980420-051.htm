Hi all,

I recently got lucky -- here's the story -- with a little something to 
learn.

A little over a week ago, I was just pulling away from work after being 
up all night.  Just when leaving the parking lot, the 928 lost power and 
died.  I pulled off to the side of the road, and tried to restart it.  No 
luck.  I towed the car home, figuring that eiter the fuel filter or pump 
was the cause.  Replaced the filter -- still no start.  Checked the 
output on the pump and that was great.  Spark was O.K., Temp II sensor 
was O.K., Cold start sensor was O.K.   (I was going down the trouble 
shooting list in the manual -- not necessairly in this order.)  Anyway, 
the only thing I could think of was something bad could have happened.  
(by the way, thanks to the guys at 928 International for your help!)  
Anyway, Towed the car to Precision Motion (a super repair shop in 
Riverside, CA -- specializes in Porsches (and the owner previously owned 
a 928.))  They found it to be what I was afraid of.  The timing belt had 
slipped 8 teeth on the right bank!  I had a receipt that the timing belt 
had been changed at the proper interval and was planning on changing it 
about 10,000 miles early (around 100,000 miles) just to be on the safe 
side.  The current timing belt looked fine -- it was just too loose!  
Moral of the story is this.  Don't assume that just because you have a 
receipt your timing belt is O.K.  I got lucky -- no valve damage (my car 
loves me back!)  Our PO's are nice enough to sell us their cars, but they 
may have slipped up on some maintence.  Don't tempt fate.  Check the 
tension!

Lucky this time,

J.B. Liddle
