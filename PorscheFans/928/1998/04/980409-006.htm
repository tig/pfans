There are a couple of options to restore the black (trim) around the
quarter windows.
1.  You can mask the area off, rough up the finish with Scotch-brite,
and use black trim paint available from several manufacturers.   I used
Wurth's trim paint with good results.   However, I've not found any
formula that gives a really tough coat - it can be scratched off rather
easily.   As mentioned, I'm happy with my result and intend to stay on
top of maintaining any nicks or scratches.

2.  Rest of options involve removing the trim - but beware - you can
only get the trim piece back in there by removing the
glass/weatherstrip, placing the trim in the weatherstrip, and
reinstalling the whole affair.   It's pretty involved and challenging if
you've not done this before.

Assuming the piece is out, you can paint, have it anodized (some on this
list got good results from anodizing shops), or replace with new factory
pieces.   I think Dave Roberts posted new (plastic) trim can be had for
around $50 per side.

Hope this helps.
