Obviously you didn't graduate from a Mechanical Engineering program. :-)

1 or 2 degrees in a 2' or 4' shaft is *nothing*. This isn't a brain
surgery calculation. Torque is easy, what did you say you measured on =

the dyno? With the diameter and length of the drive shaft its fairly =

easy to predict how much it will twist. Whats much harder is to predict =

the additional loads on the bearings due to buckling.

Twising is probably designed into the 928's drive shaft. The twisting
acts like your suspension, protects the engine from certain road peak
loads, protects the transmission from certain engine peak loads. When =

motorcycles got drive shafts the manufacturers had to put a spring/cam =

assembly inline to absorb these peak loads.

I remember a '70's article in Hot Rod on axel shafts. Recomended using a
tough epoxy paint (don't scratch a line!) to draw a line from your hub
to the center splines and periodically check it. When the axel shaft
twisted 360 degrees swap it with the axel shaft in your daily driver as
these axels (Chevy or Ford, I forget) typically broke at 1-1/2 to 2
complete turns of permanent twist.

Another example: think of the torsion suspension on the rear of a 911 =

or the front of old Chrysler products. Probably 15 or 30 degress of =

twist between an unloaded torsion bar and a fully compressed suspension. =

Coil springs compress by twisting too, not by bending, but this is =

harder to visualize.

The human mind ordinarily operates at only ten percent of its
capacity -- the rest is overhead for the operating system.
