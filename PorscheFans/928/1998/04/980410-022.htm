    I have been driving my 928 (78') without the benefit of power
steering for several days now. I had a nasty leak in the rack so I
removed the Power Steering Pump belt (Thanks to those on the list who
reminded me to do so).
I've got to say that I am getting quite accustomed to the feedback on
the freeway. (It feels GREAT, i feel like I have  much more precise
control) I have gotten to the point where I can navigate at low speeds
with one hand - But parking still requires a herculean effort. (No
parallel parking for me in the near future)

The downside - backing into my new driveway without power steering was
not something that nature intended. Put a nice scratch on my new paint
job when I miscalculated where I was in relation to a certain wall which
will remain unnamed. Its one of those things that I will notice every
time I see my car until i get it fixed, but I point it out to other
people and they say 'what scratch' (Gotta know your car)

I also finally got around to replacing the reservoir for the cooling
system. (Mine had a crack on the top and wasn't holding the correct
amount of pressure) I have to say that could have been a whole lot
easier if it was placed 3 or 4 inches away from the fender. As it is
working under the lip of the fender is nearly impossible. During that
job I decided to remove about 50 feet of wiring that was attached to a
dysfunctional alarm system that the PO must have put in. That system had
tendrils going EVERYWHERE in the car. The engine compartment looks much
cleaner now with that beast removed. (Also i may be imagining things,
but the car feels slightly quicker now) Now to my questions:

Imagine that I am a Systems administrator and I am barely above the
level where people describe things in fuel burning engines as 'the
doohickey' - So Please bear with me.

1. After removing the old reservoir - I noticed the the metal pipe which
runs fore to aft which branches off to connect (via a short rubber tube
6" long) to the bottom of the reservoir. At the back end of this pipe
(towards the cab of the vehicle) There is a junction box. Traveling
towards the center of the car is a (in my case) heavy red heater hose.
At the back end of the junction box, there was a 4" elbowed hose which
was attached to absolutely nothing. In fact I was able to pull it off
with a quick tug without even loosening it. Anyone have any ideas?

2. Some of the pervasive tendrils from my alarm system went to the 'bus'
connector at the bottom of my cluster. Whoever installed it cut two
wires coming out of the cluster and used butt-end-splices to integrate
them into the alarm system. Does anyone have ANY idea why that might
have been done? The only thing I can think of would be some kind of
visual feedback on the dash to notify the driver of the state of the
alarm? If there is another reason this might have been done please
advise. As it sits after removing those two wires (Which seemed to be
grounded in a roudabout fashion) the right side of my cluster went dead.
(Ie the voltmeter and the oil pressure units are killed) There is an
excellent factory groundpoint in the metal framework of the pod - When I
have time I will re-attach those wires to ground with some solder and
shrink tubing. (I dont trust anything called a 'butt-end-splice'.

3. Does anyone have a procedure for testing for faults in an ignition
coil? An old engineer here at my firm advises me that I should be able
to run some type of simple impedance check on it to make sure there are
no flaky windings in there. Mine looks about the age of the car, and it
is $67 to replace  - My goal? The car runs rough & misses. I'm beginning
to think my mechanics were blowing me off when i had them check it out..
Because they didn't check the coil or the C/D unit.. Time for a new
mechanic but anything I can do on my own I know will be right. (If not
timely)
