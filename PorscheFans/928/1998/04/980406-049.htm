I have an 84 that I purchased last June.  The PO had an extra set
of phone-dial wheels which had winter Perreli P190's on them which I am
about to change.  I've been scrubbing and polishing the anodized Disk
wheels that I pulled off late last fall, and noticed an excessive 
amount of damage caused by some kind of chemical reaction.  From the
look of the damage, it appears that someone had sprayed some kind of 
tire cleaner on, and some over-spray had run down onto the disks.  I
knew there was some damage to one wheel, but after cleaning my wheels
one at a time with ample citrus cleaner, brush and time, I have noticed
it on all 4 of them - the one is especially bad.  I suppose I can cover
it up with some kind of silcone wipe, but that's why I'm asking the 928
team.

It almost seems as if the spray had etched the metal on the wheel.  I
have tried several types of polish; Blue Magic, Never-Dull wadding,
Brasso, and some compound abrasives such as 3M Imperial, and liquid
ebony and even  steel wool.  Nothing seems to remove this deposite or
etching.  I also tried a bit of Aluminum Jelly and found that it did a
little etching of its own (which thnkfully I was able to clean off).  I
used both a big Milwaukee buffer, a Dremel tool and my hand.  I'm afraid
to use anything more abrasive or exert excessive pressure and cause
uneven shiny spots on the metal.  The wheels are not show-quality, but
they are still in real good shape.  Is there a super-hard coating of
clear on them?  It's difficult to tell, but nothing seems to lessen the
damage to the finish except the blue magic/Dremel tool combination, and
this is only a 20% improvement.

If anyone has suffered this kind of damage and was able to fix it, I
would love to know what they did!  Any Ideas?
