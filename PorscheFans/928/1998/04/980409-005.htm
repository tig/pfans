Fellow Shark owners,

My mechanic gave my recent purchase(1986.5 928S) a good going over.  Seems 
the A/T would compress the shift between the first two gears almost into 
one and when it did it do it with a bone jarring thunk.  What the mechanic 
discovered was that the vacuum hose was full of holes and the shift 
modulator was not functioning.  After he replaced them he also saw that the 
adjustment for the 'detent' was way out.  It looked like the PO's mechanic 
tried to compensate for the lack of vacuum with the 'detent' adjustment. 
 Forgive me I am new to this so if I don't get the lingo right you'll 
understand.  The upshot of all this is now the shift from 2nd to 3rd is 
quiet and crisp, but 3rd to 4th is mushy, (i.e. the engine hovers a second 
or so before shifting).  This also occurs when kicking down to 3rd from 
4th.

Anybody else suffered with this?

Other things to report...

Some folks have posted questions about ineffective A/C and constant warm 
air coming in.  I had this until my Porsche wrench found several vacuum 
lines disconnected.  Now everything works fine.

Also, I had posted an email about my faulty oil pressure gauge. As it turns 
out some previous mechanic had stabbed the oil pressure sending unit with 
what would appear to be a phillips screw driver.  I guess he skewered the 
oil filter to remove it and nailed the sending unit in the process.   That 
cured the leak and the faulty pressure in one fell swoop.

If you're in or near Atlanta and need a good Porsche mechanic I'd recommend 
mine in a heartbeat.  He's Joel Roeder @ Northpoint Foreign Auto Repair 
770/475-9316.  He's got folks from as far away as Mississippi and 
Chatanooga dropping off there cars there.  A special thanks to Rich Jaffe 
for recommending him to me.

Regards, Kevin
