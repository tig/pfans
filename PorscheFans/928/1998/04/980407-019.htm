I have an 88 930T, and have had many other Porsches....all with pitted
windscreens.  Usually, I am a hardcore OEM'er, but I have to admit the
Americans make the hardest glass that I have ever used.  The problem
with the OEM German glass is that it is too damn soft.  I have tried
polishing my pitted winscreens, and the pits refused to go.   My
suggestion is that when you go to replace your windscreen, you try an
American supplier.   I was in the Porsche parts business for a couple of
years, and most of the (reluctant) customers that I referred to using
the substantially cheaper imitation glass, were later inclined to agree
with this solution.

(Hmmm...)
