Well i have completely lost faith in my mechanics. After having the car
into their shop multiple times looking for my rough-running  gremlin I
have taken it upon myself to take the thing apart myself and find the
problem. The first notable thing I found? The vacuum advance hose has an

inch long split in it where it attaches to the doohickey on the
distributor. I've also found some breather hoses which are so hard you
could fashion them into lutes. (those are on order).

Heres the question i pose to you - I have been curious about my ignition

coil [basically I am trying to test everything I can with my meager
means] - so i found a sheet at Chief Auto parts which has a procedure
for testing one with a simple Ohm-Meter. The procedure is written up as
such:

Set your meter to its lowest setting eg. 200ohms   [my lowest setting it

20ohms]
Place the test leads between the outside terminals. For this Bosch part
# you should get .43-.53

[Ok so thats straightforward - I get .4 ohms - .7 ohms depending on what

part of the terminal I touch the meter to, will clean terminals shortly]

But heres the second thing, I should now set my meter to the 20K ohm
range and do the same reading again - only this time I should get
a reading of 630-770 - What magic is this? I am confused. Does this make

any sense to you? (Obviously the true resistance is so low that my meter

will not display anything but dead short at that high of a setting.
Maybe they want me to test another set of terminals or something?)
Thanks!

By the way, if I assume that I _DO_ need to test between either of the
outside terminals and the ignition wire terminal (What is it called,
primary terminal?) I get a reading of 8.7k ohms, which would be a bad
value regardless of how you tried to read "630-770".
