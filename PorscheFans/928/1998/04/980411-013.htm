Hi everybody!

I'm wondering how a 928 performce on the track compared to the 911? Is
the 911 faster on a slower track than the 928? I'm thinking of taking
the shark to the track this summer to do some fishing ;-)

David, you say that it may have rough idle if the battery is
disconnected for some time. I experianced this and after about 10 min
the idle was ok, but the engine was acting odd in otherways. If i reved
it up the idle would be very high (1500-2000 rpm) and if I reved it up
again it would do that without hesitaion but die directly when it was
supposed to idle. Had no problem to start it up again. Could this be due
to battery disconnection, the computer didn't have enough data? Or do I
have another problem? I haven't started the car since that due to snow
and some repairs.

Thanks
