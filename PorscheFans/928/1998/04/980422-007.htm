 I finally bought after 4 months of all sorts of fiascos 91 928 GT red.
 Thanks for all the advice from the list. Amazingly nothing happened in transportation as well. I have a 30 day by back gaurenty. But I won't use it. Everything seems to be working except driver side seat. When I try to move it forward, it goes a little while and started turning towards the middle of the car. What is happening you think? Are there servo moters on either side and one of them fialed? or Something stuck in the guiding track?

  Also, the insurence people are trying to chew me up. I am located in San Diego any advice on insurence companies. Where is a good 928 shop near by?
