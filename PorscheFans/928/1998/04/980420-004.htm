Phil,
re. plug gap/coil failure.
Some thoughts on plug gap.  If you open the gap to much, the following
can happen.  1. your gap setting will require a higher voltage to jump
the gap.  This will will require the high voltage winding of the coil
to be stressed voltage wise, which may lead to internal insulation
failure.  If you try to check it out with an ohmmeter it will check
out fine because you are not stressing the winding insulation, but in
service it can breakdown.  2. As with most electrical components, the
coil has a Volt-Amp rating.  As you raise the voltage required to jump
the gap of the plug, you are increasing the Volts, while hopefully
decreasing the amps.  As you increase the gap, you will decrease the
amps so while you will be getting a longer spark, it will be a colder
one.  3. You are also stressing the plug wire insulation.

As far as to narrow a gap, this can lead to a higher current (hotter)
spark which can result in early plug ware failure. I agree the gap
specified in the manual seems narrow, I even set mine a little wider,
but when the coils start to fail, I think you have reached the max for
the system.  Keep in mind, when the race cars are set up for wider
gaps, they have coils and wires designed to deliver a hot spark at the
higher voltage required to jump the wider gap.

I know this will "spark" a lot of comments and a lot of theory I have
left out. We have to believe the engineers have the best gap vs temp
vs system ratings etc. all figured out.
