Dan,

I don't know if this helps any, but I just had my AC fixed and one of 
the problems found was that my compressor clutch was not working either.  
He traced it to a burned ground wire in the clutch solenoid (I think).  
Soldered in a new one and it worked great.

He also found a leaky expansion valve (that was replaced), and leaking 
schrader(sp.?) valves on the compressor (fixed with sealing caps).  New 
receiver/dryer (which I supplied), and R-12 (at $40 a lb or something!). 
Seems to be working so far...  $687.00 later!! :-(   Now I remember why 
I do all my own work when I can!

'83 928 S - cool for the moment, keeping fingers crossed...
'74 914 2L - air cooled, in more ways than one ;-)
P.S.- My 928's black too, I know how you feel...
