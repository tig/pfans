The dry chemical is usually baking powder and clean up is a
mess.  The residue is reported to eat metal over time but I
don't have any more info on that.  These types of FE are the
lowest in price though and that's what I have been buying. 
Whether or not I will hesitate to use in a fire is not a
question at all - YES I will if I can.

Halon rests at the top end of the scale - not much cleanup
involved.  VERY EFFECTIVE at putting out the fire. 
Unfortunately it can put you out as well but we can't have
it all I guess.  Again rule number one is to get out of the
burning car (hopefully you'll have stopped first or at least
slowed enough to bail).

A new option I'm learning about is a Halon-substitute which
"works as well and doesn't destroy metal".  A call to your
favorite race supplier should have more details.

Cool cars, I used to groove on the 250 coupes too!  I like
German two-doors I guess...
