Greetings' all. As it's been some time since my last posting, I'll
attempt to play "catch-up" with some recent digest items.

1. To the gentleman who inquired about installing blue halagon "flame
throwers" on his Shark...please be so kind as to turn your keys in to
the nearest PCA chapter. Your Toyota Corolla low-rider is waiting.
2. It's a coin holder. Mensa will not be returning your calls.
3. It's called "torque steer" and yes, it does feel as though you're
driving 
4. After several years of happy Sharking, I suddenly realized that
I've never seen nor heard my cooling fan work Can someone give me the
checklist procedure?
5. Anyone know what might cause erratic A/T operation ? Sometimes it
works like a charm, othertimes I'd swear it was posessed by a 
maleviolent entity.
6. We've begun manufacturing 1998, U.S. street legal Jeep(GP)M-151
Utility Vehicles. Anyone in the auto export business out there...?
