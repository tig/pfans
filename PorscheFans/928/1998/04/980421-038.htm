OK, I have polled several '28 owners about their cars and I have received many
"different" views on the car as a whole.  Some say it is extremely expensive
to upkeep, others say it's not that bad.  Some say you should no drive it
daily, some say you can.  I know all of these are "relative" but as a whole is
the Shark really worth the "extra" effort it allegedly demands?  Yeah, it's
fast, it's a V8, it's cool, it's a Porsche, blahbiddy blahbiddy blah...  Only
you guys who own these babys really know.  Point blank, my nick name is not
"money-bags" and I don't want a car that will require $1,000/year (especially
beyond standard maintenance).  I don't want a car that will leave me stranded.
And I've been seeing some horror stories on this list of drivers getting
stranded.  No way for me man.  I want to move up to something nice, possibly
sporty, and 88-89 '28 S4's are in my price range.  That car definitely rocks
my face and I would love to have one....  HOWEVER.  Being the smart shopper
that I am I must confess I have doubts and I hate having doubts.  That's
exactly why I subscribed to this list.  TO LEARN.  I am sure I can find a car
that has already had the high mileage maintenance done to it and if so, will I
have a dependable, pretty much "silly" maintenance free vehicle that I can
drive like a sports car daily.  I do not neglect my vehicles, I do not race
them.  But I do drive them like a fun sportscar should be driven.  Am I
looking to the right vehicle or should I be looking elsewhere..  HONESTLY
Please help, for I am about 4 months away from getting my new vehicle,
whatever it is.  So, I am searching now to find the right one.  Please E-mail
me directly.

Thanks much
