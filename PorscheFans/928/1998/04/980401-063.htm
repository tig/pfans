> A truck driver used  to amuse himself by running over lawyers he would
> see walking down the side of the road. Every time he would see a lawyer
> walking along the  road, he  would swerve to hit him,  and there  would
> be  a loud "THUMP" and then he would swerve back  on the road.
>
> One day, as the truck driver was driving along he saw a  priest hitch
> hiking. He thought he would do a good turn and pulled the truck over.
>
> He asked the priest, "Where are you going, Father?".
> "I'm going to the church 5 miles down the road!", replied the priest.
>"No
> problem, Father! I'll give you a lift. Climb in the truck". The  happy
> priest  climbed into  the passenger seat and the truck driver continued
> down  the road.
>
> Suddenly the truck driver saw a  lawyer walking down the  road and
> instinctively  he  swerved to  hit  him.  But then  he
> remembered there was a priest in the  truck with him, so at the last
> minute he swerved back to  the road,  narrowly missing  the lawyer.
> However even though he was certain  he missed the lawyer, he still  
>heard a loud "THUD".

>
> Not understanding where  the noise came from he glanced  in his mirrors
> and when he didn't see  anything, he turned to the priest  and said,
>"I'm
> sorry father.  I almost hit that lawyer."

> "That's okay", replied the priest. "I got him with the door!
