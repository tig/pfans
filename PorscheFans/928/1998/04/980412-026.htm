Several weeks ago I broadcast a request for experiences regarding fire
extinguisher mounting in Sharks.  Several people, in particular David
Lloyd, John White, and Phil Tong, recommended the Brey-Krause mount.

What follows is my experience of mounting a Fire Extinguisher (FE)
with the Brey-Krause seat bracket in a full power seat.  The following
should be valid for seats in Sharks starting with MY 87. If interested
read-on.

Note standard disclaimer: Opinions expressed are my own, your mileage
may vary, Caveat Emptor, yada, yada, yada...

The Brey-Krause bracket is a stubby 'U' shape with a plate welded at
the bottom of the U on which the FE mounts:

|O       /		          \--\_ |  |  \
--------		                \__/   \  


The FE mounts to the plate or to the angled portion of the adaptor
plate.  The bracket (the ends of the U) slides inbetween the seat rail
and the floor board seat rail mount.  In the picture above the 'O's
mark the holes where the seat rail bolts slide through the bracket.

I ordered the bracket from O G Racing:
(http://209.19.107.64/ogshell/loadpage.pl?477+index.html) 

When I ordered the bracket the person on the other end of the phone
stated that the bracket would limit forward travel of the seat. He
suggested that I also order the adaptor plate as it would allow for
more forward seat travel.  So, I ordered both - $62.95 for the bracket
and $10.49 for the adaptor plate (plus shipping of course).

The installation of the bracket is straight-forward. It takes about 30
minutes and requires a Phillips screwdriver, a hex bolt (Allen?)
socket (or simple hex wrenches, but your hands will wear out unless
you use a socket and ratchet), and a 6mm (or was it 5 or 7?) socket if
you want to install the adaptor plate.

1) Slide the seat all the way back to allow access to the front bolt
on both seat rails.

2) Un-bolt the front of the seat rails.  There is a brass (?) plate
underneath the seat rail that the bolt threads into as well as a
washer.  Retain the bolt, plate and washer.

3) Slide the ends of the bracket inbetween the seat rails and rail
mounts.  This may require you to wedge a screw driver inbetween the
rail and mount to allow the bracket to side inbetween - the fit is
quite snug.

4) Re-attach everything by threading the bolt through the seat rail,
bracket, and rail mount.

5) Attach FE mount to bracket plate.

6) Strap in FE. 

Done.

Simple.

Now, the _real_ story.

The bracket prevents the last 50% (approximately) forward travel of the
seat.  The adaptor plate is designed to allow for about 2.5 more
inches of forward travel.  However, it doesn't.

The FE mounting plate is welded flush with the top of the bracket.
The electric motor that moves the seat forward and backward is mounted
on the bottom of the seat frame just under the front of the seat and
is protected by a black plastic shield.  When the seat slides forward
the protective cover and motor hit the leading edge of the mounting
plate.

If the mounting plate or the bracket itself was about 5mm lower the
electric motor and protective cover would slide over the top of the
mounting plate. THEN the adaptor would allow the FE to mount in front
of the bracket instead of on top of the bracket.

I tried mounting the entire assembly upside-down but there isn't
enough space between the passenger side inside seat rail, the floor,
and the torque tube carry through box.  Perhaps that is not the case
on the driver's side.  I didn't try it as I had already decided to
mount on the passenger side.

The final score is that the bracket works. BUT, if you are less than
5'10" in height and if you mount the bracket on the driver's seat you
will not have enough forward seat travel to reach the pedals.  I chose
to mount the bracket on the passenger's seat. With the bracket
installed the maximum forward travel is about 2 inches behind where I
have the driver's seat set - I'm 5'8".

I went ahead and splurged the extra $20 for the chrome FE 'cause I
think it looks better than the fire-engine red FE.  Passenger comfort
is not compromised by the FE - well, at least not for my passenger.

I hope the above is at least somewhat useful for those contemplating
FE installation.  Additional suggestions are of course welcome - as
long as they don't involve a blow torch, parts of my anatomy that
don't generally see sunlight, etc.  Lessons on proper terms for
various parts of a Shark's anatomy (and proper use of hyphens and
apostrophes) are probably necessary (torque tube carry through box?)

Thanks for the advice listers - I'm only pads and fluid away from the
track now!  (Anybody got advise on installing brake pads and flushing
the brakes?)
