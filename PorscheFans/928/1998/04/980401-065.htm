Hi O Wise Finned Ones!!

I heartily thank all whom replied to my plea for help!! However, upon
reviewing my post, I realise I forgot to mention that the fuel pump and
filter are new...(and expensive). This unfortunately rules out the lower
right rear quadrant of this complex beast... I was actually beginning to
suspect the trio of pressure regulators that are in the fuel loop around
the engine feeding the injectors.  I have no experience with the "rising
rate" regulaters, but perhaps someone can comment on their necessity on
a modified engine.  The only other time I've had any engine do this, was
a turbo bike detonating at RPM, it would actually stall at 7-8000 rpm!
Do any of you techtypes think I could have a lean-out sponsored
detonation?? (say it ain't so..)

Today I "tested" the car some more, and only once out of 5 blasts did
the stumbling occur... Maybe coming out of hibernation was rough on the
shark this year, and the problem will go away!!
(fishful thinking)
((nomex on))

Thanks again!!
