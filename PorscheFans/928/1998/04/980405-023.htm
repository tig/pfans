Rich,

Your car is 100% definitely a total loss. My isurance company totalled my
85' S for a minor 20 mph hit that damaged the rear bumper cover, and the
hatch, and bent the right quarter a little. You're talking bumper cover,
hatch, hatch glass, both quarters, and the roof! You have some serious
frame damage. This car is toast unfortunately. I hope you weren't in it.

If you have collision, make the claim through your insurance company, the
other will seriously rob you. You should get $14-16k for your shark.

Good Luck, and cheer up!

Paul H.
