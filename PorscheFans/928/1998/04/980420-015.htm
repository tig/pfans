<<But I'm still

puzzled, how did you all know what it was? I looked through the owner's

manual (and, of course, all 9 volumes of the repair manuals) and found

NO mention, or even depiction, of the darn thing.>>

Are you kidding?  Just look at it.  I would have thought the thinly disguised
sarcasm would have scared you from asking how anyone knew what it was.  I
haven't read the next two digest from this weekend yet, so I'm sure to read
more thinly disguised sarcasm.

Oh well, at least you asked a question you needed answered.  No question is a
dumb question kind of thing.
