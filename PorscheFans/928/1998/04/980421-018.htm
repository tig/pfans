Well, the good news is that the mechanic found the "surging" problem.
The bad news is I can't afford to keep feeding the 928 dog food at these
repair prices!!

Yes, 2 pounds of dog food was vacuumed out of my car and $200 worth of
wires have to be replaced because of the rodent damage. I'm hoping they
were mice and now homeless!

So the lesson in this story, just because a car has service records and
is well-maintained does not mean it's not home to unwelcomed occupants.

You people don't even want to know what the bill is up to now. For all
you lurkers/future 928 owners who don't believe that 928s are expensive
to maintain, e-mail me!!!

I want my car back : (
