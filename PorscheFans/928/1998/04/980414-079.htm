Jeff -

What a great idea!  Using Folia Tec caliper paint kit on
manifolds!  Winner!  The intake should never get as hot as
brake calipers, which can be red hot during extreme racing
conditions.  At least the rotors do!

My intake is just beginning to bubble around the Porsche
type.  I think you need to take it off to media blast before
painting.  

Now that I mention this, at least one of my rear calipers is
peeling it's black finish too.

The caliper paint kit is supposed to come with prep
instructions, maybe there's some trick to this to make
things less painful?  NOPI has the kits in stock, and I
think the latest Performance catalog lists them too.

Unless someone else thinks of a reason (other than
originality's sake) why this wouldn't work, I think you just
scored with a really neat and cheap DIY mod.  Hopefully the
intake doesn't have to come off!
