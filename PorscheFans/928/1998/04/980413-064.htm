Thanks, it's just that I don't want to make a fool out of myself, if the 
car turns out to be outperformed easily by the 911, but by your post (and 
others, thanks) it looks like the 928 is capable of keep up and be faster 
than the 911 with a good driver. Yes I've never been on the track 
before and I will take it easy in the beginning and just learn how the car 
behaves.

Thanks again, Sincerly
