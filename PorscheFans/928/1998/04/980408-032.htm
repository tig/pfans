	There is a transducer fitted to the differential that sends a signal to 
	the speedo. Its a round, plastic thing that sits in a "well" in the rear 
	of the housing. Mine fell out and was just hanging from the wire. Putting 
	it back where it belonged fixed things for me. At least it did. My 
	odometer quit on me yesterday but as the speedo is working I assume I 
	have the plastic gear failure that seems so common. Did someone post info 
	on buying just the gear? Where? The voltmeter quit last week also so it 
	looks like I'm into pod removal in the very near future.

	Philips Knoxville from you email address? Still making those big screen 
	TV's down there?

	Colin, how 'bout replacing the cheesy voltmeter with a Fluke DVM eh?   Shouldn't
be a problem since you have the resources..  :-)
