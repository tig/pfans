Reminds me of stories of old VW Rabbits that would also crack their
windshields under severe cornering(torsional) loads.  BTW, a rule when
lifting either of my cars, I use two jacks to lift either end, or side
evenly.  I don't like the thought of all the support structure being
pulled or pushed trying to keep its shape when just one corner is up.  I
know it's probably overkill, but I can't help myself.  As a MechE  these
things just come to mind.

There are a lot of very interresting and informative postings at this
site,  and for all I have learned, thank you all, I would like to add
what I think is very important.  I read somewhere, never jack up the
928 with the engine cross brace off.  I knew not to do it, but had it
off for painting. The next day I jacked up the left side of the car to
acess the cam belt tensioner.  I didn't hear it, but the next time I
looked at the windshield it had a crack in the lower left hand corner.
I am posting this so others won't make the same mistake.
