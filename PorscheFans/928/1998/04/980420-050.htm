Ever hear of PCB's? Not Printed Circuit Boards, but the nasty chemical 
PCB? Well there *might* be some inside your coil.

Not really much in there to look at, laminated plates of soft iron 
wrapped with loops (coils) of copper wire. Possibly in a bath of PCB's 
for conducting heat. Electrically its not really a "coil" but a 
"transformer" (two coils wrapped around the same magnetic core).
