I replaced my oil pan gasket on my '85 without removing or loosening the
cross member (smacked the pan on a huge starter motor sitting in the road;
$200 for a replacement off a wrecked car).  With the car on ramps:
    1.    drain oil
    2.    remove starter (no need to disconnect)
    3.    remove the bolt in each motor mount
    4.    jack up motor (the maximum will be several inches until the bell
housing hits)
    5.    remove the 30 or so bolts from the oil pan
    6.    with the pan dropped down and resting on the crossmember, reach in
and remove the three bolts holding the oil pickup in place and let the
pickup fall into the pan (the pan will hit the pickup if it is not removed)
    7.    pull pan forward and out
    8.    when reinstalling, I reconnected the pickup and then worked the
gasket in around the bottom of it because you will spend a long time
reconnecting the pickup and the gasket will be in your way and will get
damaged/torn/whatever.

Sounds easy, right?!?  It took me a full Saturday and half a Sunday to do
this!  There is maybe 3 inches of opening at the front of the pan.  You will
have to get both hands and tools into the pan to work on the bolts.  There
is also very little room to move a wrench around in there once you get it on
the bolt.  I used a small 1/4" drive air tool to help.  Still extremely
frustrating.  But it can be done.  Don't torque the pan bolts in too tight,
as everybody has said, or you will just compress the gasket until you have
problems.

If I had to do it again, I wouldn't drop the rack, I wouldn't jack up the
engine, I would pay the requisite $80 an hour and sit at home with a
margarita while someone else figures it out.
