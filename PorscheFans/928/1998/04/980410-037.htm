The Porsche 928 air filter is easily four times the size of
any typical J-car filter.  I don't think it's ever been
proven that a K&N will outflow the stock 928 filter either. 
Add that the 928 has a good-sized plenum and twin cool air
pickups stock (from the 70's even) and I think we have it
made already intake-wise.  There was some discussion on
tapping the cowl plenum and Devek has announced on their
webpage that something is in the works.  

The benefit of a K&N or any other reusable for us is just
that - we can clean, reoil and replace ad infinitum or at
least as long as the foam holds up.  I'd recommend getting
two filters as it's a b@tch waiting for the filter to air
dry (no compressed or heat allowed).  Then you're supposed
to oil it, wait for that to settle then reoil any dry
spots.  Time consuming and much easier to have one on hot
standby, then clean and oil the old one at your leisure.

There are some for sale used from time to time, maybe Mark
Anderson has a bunch too?
