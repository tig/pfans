The only really stupid questions are those that are not asked, and then 
somebody does something really stupid and breaks their pretty Porsche.

However, you have the coolant fill-thing right. You could think of the
928's reservoir as simply an extension to the radiator. On many cars a
plastic coolant tank is literally an overflow tank, as with my Infiniti
G20. The big difference is the reservoir drains from the bottom into the
block, while an overflow tank also drains from the bottom but connects
to the radiator cap. Coolant flows both ways in an overflow tank's tube.
