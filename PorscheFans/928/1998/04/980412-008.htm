Shark-meisters

 On my way in to the office this morning (I know, its Easter Sunday, I'm
not well) I saw a fellow lingering in front of Whole Foods savoring a
cup of coffee. As I approached, he waved at me. I didn't recognise him
but just as I passed, I realised he was leaning against a 928, silver
metallic just like mine. I really appreciate the cameraderie. As these
cars continue to fall into the hands of enthusiasts who cherish them (a
trend I believe is currently ongoing) we're bound to become a tighter
and tighter group. I hope he saw me wave back!

P.S. The latest issue of "Automobile" magazine has various lists of "10
Bests" and editors' choices . Did anyone notice which car was the ONLY
out-of-production model listed in the category of "Car I'd Most Like To
Drive Across Country" ?  Ten guesses, and the first 9 don't count.

Happy Easter egg (or 'Vette) hunting.
