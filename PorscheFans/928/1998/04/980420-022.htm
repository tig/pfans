Since the other day when I posted a message looking for Paul, I have
received messages from current customers of Paul's having the same problem
contacting him or receiving merchandice.  There have also been several
people that wrote me that were about to send Paul money that will be
waiting until they hear back from me before sending the checks.  I would
advice other concerned parties to do the same.  I am not saying that Paul
is not a legitimate business person (yet), he may just be behind in his
shipments.  Either way I wish I could get him to contact me to let me know
the status of my seat order.  I checked with the bank and the check has
been cashed.

If any of you know his direct phone # can you please forward it to me.  He
does not return his pages.
