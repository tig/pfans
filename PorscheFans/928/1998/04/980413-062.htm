Hi all!

I'm looking at purchasing a 1988 928 S4, that is in gorgeous shape, but I
still want to have it checked out before I buy it.  High dollar suprises
don't amuse me much, although I'm ready to pay to take care of this
incredible car for many years to come.

Does anyone have any recommendations on a good shop (or shops) in the
Dallas/Ft. Worth area where I can have this car checked out by a 928
expert?  The North Dallas area is better for me overall, but I will take it
wherever I need too.  I hear Austin is nice this time of year... ;-)  Who
can resist driving there in a 928??!

Thanks so much!  I really love the web site, and related links and I have
gotten a ton of great info out of it.  If this all comes together, I
certainly plan to get more involved in every aspect.  I already got the
PorscheFans club app. and I am filling it in!

928 Forever!
