>My question, can this socket be replaced without removing the central tube?

Here is what I have done:  
 Fix #1 (cheap and easy): The first time this happened, years ago in an 
autocross, I took two large hose clamps, put them in series, and snaked 
the end up and around the torque-tube and cinched it down fairly tight 
right at the threaded portion of the ball-joint.  If the shifts feel a 
little stiff, leave it, as it will loosen over the next 100 miles.

 Fix #2 (takes time, but is bullet-proof):  Same idea as above, but I 
machined a piece of Teflon to slice over the front shift-linkage and 
secured it with two sets of clamps against the torque tube (made the face 
against the TT curved).

The reason #2 was done, was that I shift waay too hard for the OEM 
shift-linkage (it is rather inadequately designed, IMO).  After, popping 
a new linkage back into place 3 or 4 times, a better sol'n was in order.  
After thinking about, I think that the cleanest, best solution wuld be to 
replace the OEM ball-joint with a true rod-end.
