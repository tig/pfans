My car uses S4 rear wheels on the track, BFG R1's, with the spacer.
245-45/16 size, only a bit wider than the 225-50/16's.
It's a close fit, but there's no evidence of contact between the
tire and the sheet metal. It is conceivable, however, that different
tires might not fit so nicely, as there seems to be a surprising
lack of consistency across brands. 

The problem with removing the spacers is that you need to either use
open-end lug nuts or replace the wheel studs with shorter ones.
The open-end steel lug nots are fine for the track, but not so
attractive for the street.
