	Ok. What is MIME format, and why do my messages always appear with it?

	Jacob:

	I'd like to know the answer to this one as well. We might ask Vince Yu,
	as his posts seem to be in this format also, and he strikes me as the
	sort of fellow who would probably be able to tell us more than we want
	to know about it. On the other hand, if your computer doesn't have 4
	wheels and gobs of torque, I'm not so sure it IS Vince's area of
	expertise.

Howard,
Not sure to take your comments as a compliment or an insult.  Since I'm a humorous kinda
guy most of the time, I'll take it as a compliment.  :-)

MIME - Misspelled for MINE.
MIME - A format that only a performer in pantomine can understand
MIME - Stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
MIME - http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/MIME.html.  MIME EXPLAINED!!
