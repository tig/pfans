In 1995 Hondas the problem of air conditioners making odd noises is not
uncommon.  If this is a problem, then you should check to see if your car
was made in the Kyoto plant.  There was a serious labor problem in that
plant for most of the assembly time for MY95 cars.

It seems that the imported labor force that was used in the a/c assembly
area was Korean.  They were protesting unfair labor practices, and when a
settlement was slow in being implemented, there were a certain number of
plastic wrapped packages of pickled cabbage inserted inside the blower
housing.  In time, this plastic has deterriorated, and voila:  raunchy odor.

Service bulletin #97-01-05445 identifies the fix on this, and the procedure
to follow.  The bulletin is known within Honda Motor Co as "the kimchee fix"
