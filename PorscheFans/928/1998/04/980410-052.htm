Just got the car back from the wizards at August Euro.  Happy to report
that the air conditioning system is now fully charged, the engine noise
is now absent and I am getting "normal" outside air from the climate
control system.  As a bonus, the cruise control now works.  (this was
inoperative and was on the clean-up list of things to do later).  Proof
again that vacuum leaks wreak havoc.

The rough idle was gone when the care was picked up, but they'd been
working on it during the day and the engine was still warm.  I was told
that I would still have the rough idle until warmed up because they
hadn't had a chance to fully go over the problem. Until they can cure
the leaks, no work can be done further in this area.  They did locate an
exhaust leak behind the cats.  They will be cleaning up the intake leaks
next.  Did the propane test and found leaks in the intake manifold.
When they've sorted this out, should have the faults cleared up.

The noise when cold turned out to be the air pump pully hitting the
transmission cooler hose. This was replaced with the proper belt and
replaced the air pump. The car was rear ended before I bought it and who
knows what the alignment issues where.  (My future project).  As you can
see from this post,  I am not "hands-on" with the car leaving the work
to my shop.  I envy those on the list that work on these cars.  My hats
off to you all.
