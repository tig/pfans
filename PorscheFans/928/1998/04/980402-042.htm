Ken Kasik's and Stephen's (don't have his surname)  remarks about 928s
versus Testarossas yanked a funny memory out of my failing brain.  Several
years ago I was sitting at a traffic signal in Palm Beach, heading for one
of the bridges that connect to the mainland.  I  had my 82 year old aunt in
the car with me.  This particular bridge has only one lane in each
direction,  but the approach to it has a parking lane to the right of that.
There were no cars parked next to me, but about four or five hundred feet
ahead there were several cars parked just short of the bridge.  A clown
pulled up next to me in the parking lane in a TR and proceeded to rev it up
like he was on the drag strip at Moroso.   When the light changed we both
nailed it.  My poor old aunt was in deep shock, screaming at me to slow
down. I couldn't. The devil was holding my right foot down. (I hate myself
when I occasionally do things like that}  We were absolutely neck and neck
for the first four hundred feet.  The last 100 feet were taken up by Tazio
Nuvolari in the TR sliding with all four wheels locked up to avoid smashing
into the parked cars ahead of him. I figure that he probably flat spotted
about 1500 dollars worth of tires.

My aunt was extremely narrow minded about it. Even after I told her that
she had just become part of history by riding in one of the very few cars
that ever outdragged a TR on a public street. She of course, could care
less, not knowing the difference between a Testarossa and the Graf
Zeppelin.  A few days later I parked next to a TR and went to lunch at one
of the local hangouts.  When I came out the TR was gone and someone had
"keyed" my car.  I can't get back at him unless I key every TR in Palm
Beach, and they're all over the place, and of course they're all red. My
aunt told me that God was punishing me.  She may be right, but the guy who
works on my car compounded out the scratch and it was worth it. 

Note to Bill Crosby et al.  No lives were endangered.  No pedestrians or
other cars nearby.
The only damage done was to the TRs tires, and the driver's ego and
underwear. Also, when we reached our destination, my aunt, who had been
slowing down the past few years, sprang out of the Porsche like an Olympic
gymnast and never even thanked me.  I felt deep remorse for close to three
nano seconds. After all, isn't this one of the things that 928s are about?
Besides, I'll bet Tazio will think twice before he tries to drag race
anyone in a parking lane again.
