Hi folks,
    Can anyone tell me the precise nature of the difference between the
GT exhaust system, and the S4 exhaust system.  the GT system is
described as being less restrictive, but exactly how is this
accomplished ? <<

Andy,
I recently bought a GT exhaust for my '86 928S. Here is the similarities &
differences I noticed.

The pipe OD is the same, 55 mm (2.165 in.). Both seem to be made of the same
material, non-magnetic probably stainless or similar. The GT exhaust pipes are
shaped and routed the same as the S4. The GT exhaust mounts in the same way
and would be a simple remove & replace for an S4 installation. They connect to
the rear of the "Cats" the same as an S4 or '85/'86 S. The GT pipes were
slightly different length with outlets angled a bit different than was
required to bolt up to my '86 rear muffler so I made rear a muffler bypass
pipe(s). However, I think they are exactly the same as required to fit the S4
rear muffler or S4 rear muffler bypass. The major difference is that the GT
mufflers (resonators), one in each pipe, are much smaller and lighter. I think
they are probably hollow inside. My wife drove the '86 to work today so I
can't measure them. From memory, the resonators are about 14" long, 8" wide
and 2.5" thick on the side where the pipe goes in/out tapering to 1" thick on
the side opposite of the pipes. They have a wonderfully deep throaty sound
when used with the rear muffler bypass. I don't know if there was a measurable
performance improvement with the GT pipes. I have performance numbers with the
original pipes and will check again with the GT pipes. I just haven't done it
yet. I did notice that there was an increased tendency for the engine to ping
with less than good 92 octane fuel after I put on the GT pipes. I do have a
performance chip so the timing is likely advanced a bit over stock settings.

You could probably get similar results by replacing the original mufflers
(resonators) with Flowmaster, and by all means get rid of that rear muffler.

Hope this helps.
