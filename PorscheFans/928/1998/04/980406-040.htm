Julie the blonde just got out of the tanning salon.
    Tanning was expensive so needless to say, she was getting
    pretty desperate for money.  She decided to go to the
    nicer, richer neighborhoods around town and look for
    odd jobs as a handywoman.  Well, the first house she
    came to, a man answered the door and told Julie, "Yeah, I
    have a job for ya.  How would you like to paint the
    porch?"

    "Sure that sounds great!" said Julie.

    "Well, uh, how much do you want me to pay you?" asked
    the man.

    "Is fifty bucks alright?" Julie asked.

    "Yeah that's great.  You'll find the paint and ladders
    you'll need in the garage."  The man went back into his
    house to his wife who had been listening.

    "Fifty bucks!  Does she know the porch goes all the way
    around the house?" asked the wife.

    "Well she must, she was standing right on it!" her
    husband replied.

    About 15 minutes later, Julie knocked on the door.
    "I'm all finished," she told the surprised homeowner.

    The man was amazed.  "You painted the whole porch?"

    "Yeah," Julie replied, "I even had some paint left,so
    I put on two coats!"

    The man reached into his wallet to pay Julie.

    "Oh, by the way," said Julie, "that's not a Porch, it's
    a Ferrari."
