YES!

1.  Devek swaybar - hey!  Get in line behind me!  Seriously
though, which bar
    did you get the standard or the thick one?
  
2.  Unless you have masochistic tendencies, get the
externally adjustable Konis!
    I hope someday to have those myself and will really
enjoy being able to
    simply turn the knobs to adjust vs. dismounting shock
assemble to adjust.
    Is that cool or what?

    I'm running externally adjustables on another car
(installed myself, whew)
    and I love that setup.  Gives me a boulevard ride at 2
front/1 rear.  Setup
    at max hard and unbelievable how stiff it gets, like I
changed springs or something
    but without the penalty of too lowered/riding on
bumpstops/alignment woes.

3.  What kind of rims are you using?  Be aware of the factor
rear spacer to increase
    your rear track 1"  to sort of make up for lack of 9 or
10" rear rim.  

4.  Please tell me / the list how you like those Eibachs.  


Cool thread - thanks for posting!
