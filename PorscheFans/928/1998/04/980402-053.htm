Problem is, you still get blow-by, coolant, and other contaminants that
are
smaller than what the filter can stop.  You don't really want these
spending too much time in your engine.

Red Line will supply all test data for SAE tests and their own.

Polyol ester is the only lubricant that can withstand the tremendous
heat
of jet turbine engines.  Red Line uses polyol ester as their base stock.

>>	All oils break down if to hot, NEO has the highest break down
temp.  

Except for Red Line.

>>NEO also has the highest film strength, 

Except for Red Line.
