Thanks for the interesting story, Howard. I agree with you about the 
attitudes of many people who own sports cars. It seems that the majority 
feel that they (as people) are better than everyone else because of the 
car they drive. When someone is spotted with an equivalant (or in your 
case better) car, these people become upset since they no longer are 
"king of the hill". This is incredibly childish, and wouldn't it be nice 
if these kinds of people were not allowed to own Porsches? Almost every 
time I take out my shark, I'll get people driving faster than they 
normally would, either passing me on the freeway or tailing me on two 
lanes, probably because they want to prove to themselves that they (not 
their cars) as as "good" as I am in the shark. This makes no sense to 
me, but this is our world in the 20th century. I just drive as I 
normally would, with the possible exception of getting after it in the 
twisties (which I probably would anyway even without someone on my 
tail). Sharks are known to have an appetite for "lesser" cars -- mine 
stays healthy eating lean (and my driving record and insurance rates are 
better too)!
