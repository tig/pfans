Yes, you do have to drop the rack - you don't have to undo any ball
joints - just the hoses.  You may want to replace the PS resevoir and
integral filter while you're there.  Drop the the starter (don't
disconnect wires) and cross member while supporting the engine from
above.  To do the cross member you have to undo the lower a-arms so a
toe check afterwards is in order as well.  To remove the pan bolts,
you'll want a 1/4" drive 10 mm swivel socket (has the universal joint
built in) ($5-$7?? at Sears).

I did mine too and it's already leaking again.  I measured my pan when I
had it off (tapping holes to put in the GT oil pan windage tray) and
found the mating surface to the pan to be warped by 0.1".  Now the pan's
not so rigid so I put it back as it was but you really might want to
consider using the loctite sealant.

Best,
