Kurt is essentially correct.  When I did mine (mine's an '83 16V'er, so 
yours is PROBABLY different), I didn't undo the power steering hoses 
however.  There was enough play/slack that I didn't need to.  Beware 
though, if your hoses are old and brittle they may crack and start 
leaking.  One of mine cracked quite a bit near the resevoir, from the 
stress.  I duct taped it for now =:-o, but I need to replace the thing 
soon.

I supported my engine from below with jackstands underneath the motor 
mount points.  I also used a jack under the bell housing.  While you 
have the crossmember off, it's a good time to replace your motor mounts 
too.  If you're gonna do that, you probably WILL have to support the 
engine from the top.  Big money too for motor mounts - over $200 EACH.

I put my pan back on with Loctite 599 (ultra grey gasket maker) and left 
OUT the cork gasket (I have a brand new one I can sell you if you're 
interested.  Oops, you have an S4 - never mind, PROBABLY different).  No 
leaks so far (but it's only been a few weeks).  Be advised, you could 
have a clearance problem without the thickness of the cork gasket.  Mine 
seems fine though...
