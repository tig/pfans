I expect by the time I'm done shopping that I will have spent less than 
$30K
for the pair.  Hardly a "disgusting display of wealth".  I know people 
who've
spent more than that for their SUVs.

We're closing on the financing next week, and the oldest daughter thinks 
she's
found a place of her own (so there's room in the garage).  My favorite 
lender
is a car nut himself and was happy to increase our loan amount so my wife 
can
afford school and a 928.  Let the hunt begin!
