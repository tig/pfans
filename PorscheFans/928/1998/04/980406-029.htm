Thanks for the informative replies. I've now concluded the car was massively
repainted at some point.
The interior was well worn too so its not good enough to consider fixing.

Search goes on. Anybody in the UK with a nice GT or S4sport to sell drop me
a line............

Angus, I agree with you that, call what you like, there is a serious paint
problem. If it's a custom color, it also might be difficult to match. You
are probably looking at a complete repaint - $5-6,000 US. Maybe the
mechanicals, interior, price, etc are so good it offsets the repaint?

Yes I have seen this before, on my 84.  From what I've understood, what
you are seeing is the evidence of a "break" in the seal between the door
panel which is aluminum, and possible the window trim or another
internal door structure.  The break is simply an area where 2 unlike
metals are creating a small curent (as in electric) like in a battery.
One of the metals will oxidize, and in this case, the aluminum.  It
indicates that there may have been a repair made - can you tell if there
may have been some paint work done to it?  If so, it was probably not a
real pro job.  They have to realy strip it down to bare metal and prep
it with a high quality primer before spraying the paint to make sure all
metals are isolated from each other.
You may want to check into this a little further.  My doors are showing
the same effect, but it is quite evedent that both of my doors on the
upper half (above the molding) were re-painted, and this is why I have
the problem.  I am looking for some prices on getting this fixed the
right way.  I also have a little rust - a thin line of it at the
rear-quarter panel windows where water collects and doesnt dry
immediatly.  I am going to have the glass removed and the repair done
the right way on this too.  For a repair on my car, It will require both
doors to be completely painted, both rear quarter panels done, and they
will have to spray into the front panels as well to blend in the color.
It's going to cost about 2,00 - 2,500  (ouch).
