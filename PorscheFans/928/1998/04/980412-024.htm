Joe,
There is a procedure in the Workshop manuals for advancing the odometer.

However there seems to be a section missing on how to access the Specific
Functions. In the manual it says:

1. Select Specific Functions (SF)
(refer to Service Information:Diagnosing the instrument cluster)

It then goes through the procedure of how to change the mileage, but does
not tell you how to access the "Specific Functions" routine.

I will investigate further, however your local Porsche Dealer should have
this info. It is most likely that the Service Guys have never done this and
will tell you it is not possible. Refer them to Vol. 5 Section 90 page 59
of the Factory WorkShop Manuals. (this may embarrass the Cust Service Rep.
into finding the other info)
