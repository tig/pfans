Dear fellow Land Shark Tamers:
    In response to Roger's posting
>Dear Va Porschefiles:
>I seem to remember a post about a PCA event in Virginia somewhere the end
ofthis month.  
>I think it might have been Ed Ruiz who posted.  I am afraidthat I shot my
old posts off into
>space, but would like to know where andwhen, if anyone still has it.I may
be traveling through >VA on that weekend, which I thought was the
25/26April, and if so, I would try to attend.
>Anyone made note, or Ed, you there?
>Roger

The event is a "Drive and Dine" with an optional Rally. The starting
location will be provided to registrants only. The event will start in
northern VA at 10:00 a.m. and end at a lovely picnic site in the Shenandoah
Valley. We should arrive around 1:00 p.m. The cost for the event is $15 for
each PCA member. Sorry, but space is limited, so no non members will be
allowed to participate. Let Eric Gregerson know you are interested. His
e-mail address is: gregrsn@erols.com 

Happy motoring. Ed
.
