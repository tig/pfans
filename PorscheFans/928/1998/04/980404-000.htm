I went to look at yet another GT in my long search.

It had factory special order brilliant metallic red pain, but small bubbles
of paint were evident which the dealer said was a reaction because of
Aluminium oxidation not rust. this was on the bonnet, door sills, bonnet
apron and looked bad to me.

Anyone seen this kind of effect. The car also had obvious rubbing paint from
the rear spoiler and the bonnet / front pu. Dealer said he could put this
right in a bodyshop but I'm pretty concerned about them...

In my mind these two things are enogh to reject the car but I'd be
interested to hear if others think they are normal.

Angus
Going to see another GT next week......
