David ,
In comparing apples to apples your comment of weight of the rear wheels a=
nd
"larger surface area/contact area
of the larger tires exagerating the toe in action is questionable if not
impossible.
1st.  the geometry of the rear end changes as the rear of the car is rais=
ed
on braking and going into a turn.
this is independant of the size and shape of the tires .   The forces on
the rear wheels on braking in a  turn will
not change or torque the suspension like the fronts that are constanly
sterring the car.  Certainly  the weight will not be a factor as his whee=
ls
are , by his own admission , lighter or the same than stock even though
they are 11s vs 8 " rims.  at the most , 1-5 lbs. difference.  Tthis weig=
ht
has no measurable effect  on anything.  The rears, being so much wider,
will not enhance the rear toe tendancy (Which it probably wont as there i=
s
very little forces toe in or out on the rears as they are generally
following the line of the car and if anything have only lateral forces on=

them.)    the rear of the car is lifting as the cG finds its way to the
front of the car adding all the weight to the front wheels and mostly all=

on the one front wheel as you turn and brake. the rears in the 928 just t=
oe
in slightly to keep the rear from getting loose in a decelleration turn. =

Acceleration turn , I believe it just stays at neutral as the rear
compresses.
Your comment on the weight of the wheel , multiplying the effect is more
wrong than wrong .  explain  the physics of that and I will have less dou=
bt
of your assesment of Marks suspension modifications.

2nd,  I have also witnessed the 15 foot lbs of torque gained by the s4
engine.  (I have the copy of the dyno sheet.)
as a percentage  is not as effective as it was on the 2 valve engine,  yo=
ur
right.  (do to the dual exhaust and free flow cat as well as the more tun=
ed
header like stock manifolds.)
I would love to hear from mark at 928 int about the above arguments as we=
ll
as you david as you seem like you are thinking this one through. =
