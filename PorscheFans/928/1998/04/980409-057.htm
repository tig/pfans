Ok,
so I talked to my friends boss at the porsche shop and he said to look for
some pins under the master cylinder and press them to reset it.  Well I
couldn't get it on the lift today.  I looked and could not find them from
the topside perspective.  I did however unplug the PLUG (I use very
technical terms, so try to keep up)on top of the resevoir  and then plugged
the plug back in. I then unhooked the battery negative for a few secs and
then put it back on.  Started car and WA LA,, no more warning light!

So, now my question is did I just make the light go off by disconnecting
the battery ground,, and is the problem still there.  Or does this mean
that the PLUG I on top of the resevoir had a bad contact or was the problem
that caused the light.  

GUESS WHAT I SAW AT THE SHOP ALSO?  None other than an 1994 GTS which I
knew was somewhere here in South Bend, I just didn't expect to see it.  The
owner who is Mr. Shwenk (I think that's his name) was not there though
unfortunately.  The car is awesome! You are a lucky man!
