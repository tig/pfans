Does this sound familiar to anyone?

On an '87 S4, after starting the car and driving between 20 - 100 meters,
the ABS warning light comes on. While the car was at the dealership last
week, I had them take a look. $220 later they had replaced the left front
speed sensor, and the problem still happens. 
One thing I did notice was that the old sensor (being magnetic) was
completely covered with a thick coat of metal shavings (car has 136k miles).
So I spent yesterday evening pulling the other sensors and cleaning those
metal shavings off. The ABS light came on again this morning on the way to
work. Anyone have suggestions for troubleshooting this one?

-al (going to spend the weekend re-aligning my computer and polishing those
chromed muffler bearings)
