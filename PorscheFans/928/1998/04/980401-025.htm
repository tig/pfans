Recently, my wife and I were taking our new family member (1986 S /
Black) on  its first highway trip. I went to sleep in the passenger seat
and when I awoke I looked at the speedometer and it was hovering around
90. Expressing my surprise, she said that she had picked up a BMW from
North Carolina about an ahour ago and that they were happily working
their way up I-95.

So, what do you think of the car, I asked?

"Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee," she said, never taking her
eyes off the road.
