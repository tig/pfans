The red 1987 S4 many of us have been watching lately on television, the
stock US-spec car that Al Holbert used to set the 170+ mph flying mile and
flying kilometer records at Bonneville in 1986, became a track safety car
for all the reasons you stated. It was repainted white and wore a light
bar. It's not beyond possibility that it's become red again, and that it's
the car you're discussing.
