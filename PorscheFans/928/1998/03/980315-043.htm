Experimenting mit der Sensoren - Prufen?

Today I tried to get the 'Sensorsen - Prufen?' message to re-occur on
the Information Management System on my 89S4. I lowered the pressure
in the right front tire down to 10 psi and got nothing to change on the
display. I then inflated the tire up to 50 psi and again got no error message.
My display is in english language and it is indeed straightforward to change
units back and forth from english to metric. 

I'm now wondering if the car wasn't imploring me to 'Prufen?' some
'Sensoren' unrelated to tire pressure. I'll take Dr. Bob's tip and look for
the pressure sensors but doubt that my car has the RDK system. So, the
mystery continues.

At least the 89 doesn't have hydrophobia the way the 83 did. And I feel 
blessed that I'm not getting messages saying things like ' I'm sorry Dave,
I can't do that'.

BTW:  when I topped off my warm tires/wheels at 50 psi they dropped down to
42 psi when cold.

And Finally - Anybody know what 'Typ 4' displayed on the info mangler
system might mean? I get that when I first start the car after it has been
sitting for 3 or 4 days.
I'm really going to have to get me those manuals so I can F'nR'em.
Cheers,
Jim
