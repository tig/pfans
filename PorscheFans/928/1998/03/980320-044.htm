Shark-meisters:
I've been off-line for a couple weeks- taxes, assorted business, etc. As
our weather warms up, I've noticed that my S4 is pumping out heat even
when the temp. slide is all the way to the cool end and the fan is on
"0". I remember seeing some discussion of this in the recent past, but
it wasn't until it got warm enough that I could be sure that I was also
experiencing the phenomenon.
Can anyone repost an explanation or trouble shooting steps? I don't know
if this is at all related, but I do know that my temp. gauge indicates
higher temp. than mechanic actually measured. (The cooling fan does seem
to be running a lot. As it was in this mode when I bought it last Fall,
I don't know how "normal" is supposed to be.)
I'd love to cool off the interior ambient temp. as warm weather
approaches. The AC air also doesn't seem very cool- I'm guessing a car
that lived in San Francisco until I bought it may not have had the AC
run much. (For those of you outside of the Bay Area, Mark Twain once
said that the coldest winter he ever experienced was a summer in S.F.)
Not as "cool" as I want to be...
