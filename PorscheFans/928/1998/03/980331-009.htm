Too many toys.  (3 other cars, 3 boats, and an airplane!)

slightly faded (oxidized?) to a slighlty lighter shade of brown.   Good glass.

glove compartment has shrunk.  Seats are in excellent condition.

needed to replace it shortly after I purchased the car for PM reasons. I did,
and it turned out the old belt looked almost brand new!), Clutch slave cyl and
