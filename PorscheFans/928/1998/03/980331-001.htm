Just a guess - take a close look at your rotors for
contamination with grease, crud transferred from the
pads, or whatever. Especially the rears, since you
don't feel it in the steering wheel. If it were a
warped rotor you should feel pulsations in the
pedal, but a contaminated one wouldn't cause pulsing.
