Hi, Greg. You wrote to David concerning parts number discrepancies for
clutch service items. There is a very important issue which I learned about
dramatically and is relevant to your concerns.

1987 was the first year for a single-plate clutch in the 928. You have
found the part numbers for the original clutch release ("throwout")
bearing, the guide sleeve on which it slides, and the fork which moves
everything when you step on the pedal (by the variable grace of the
hydraulic system), and it's reasonable that you look for those parts.

In late 1992, Porsche came up with a new guide sleeve and release bearing,
intended to work more smoothly and reliably. These are what Porsche built
into all 928s made since September 9, 1992 (starting with VIN 924PS820095);
in other words, all GTS cars. So, these new parts are standard components
of a GTS clutch kit.

However, they are also, since late '92, the only parts of this sort Porsche
has made. When dealer's stock of original '87 parts ran out, they were no
longer available. It's extremely unlikely that you'd find any today.

What makes this vital is that the outer diameter of the new guide sleeve is
2 mm smaller than that of the old one, and the inner diameter of the new
release bearing is, reasonably, 2 mm smaller than that of the old one as well.

If, as a too-clever-by-half shop did to me, you put the old release bearing
(provided by an independent parts supplier) on the new guide sleeve
(provided by the local Porsche dealer), you have a whole extra (not so
silly) millimeter clearance between them and loud, unpleasant things happen
as soon as you start to use the clutch.

My advice is to make absolutely sure (measure the parts; don't depend
entirely on the part numbers) that you have the new release bearing
(polyamide inner surface with ID of 32.0 mm) and the new guide sleeve (OD
31.8 mm). When you install them, do not put any lubrication on the sliding
surfaces of these parts.
