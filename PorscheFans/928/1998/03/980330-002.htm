The rear wiper is only supposed to make a few passes over the window
when you activate it, not run continuously. It's controlled by a
timer circuit built into the relay. Mine makes three passes; don't
know if that's typical. 

The black/violet wire should be hot when the ignition key is turned.
For some reason, it has no fuse protecting it, which no doubt has
something to do with why it's burned. The other thing it feeds is
the intensive cleaner switch, which is located (Guess where?) next
to the intermittent wiper control wheel. The other wire to the
intensive cleaner switch is black. So something must have shorted -
maybe the intensive cleaner pump relay - and with no fuse in the
circuit the wires got fried.

The above is based on the schematic for an '84, but it appears that
yours is the same.

My guess is that if you took a poll you would find very few who
have found much use for the intensive cleaner capability. Put
it pretty far down on your list of things to fix.
