Subject: panel removal

I just got a replacement power antenna (1980 S
Euro) and I need to get the
left rear interior panel off to put it in.  I don't
have the repair manuals,
and I can't figure out how to get the panel off. 
Take off the tool tray,
two screws under it, and scratch your head.  I
popped off some of the
press-fit fasteners, but it's still stuck.  Can
someone tell me where the
fasteners are, what type they are, and how to get
this thing off without
breaking it?  Where is the secret screw I haven't
removed?  (There has to be
one.)  Thanks for your help.

Jon, I took mine off my '81 last weekend, just by
coincidence.  There are two screws near the
bottom and one way up at the top.  Other than
that, it is head on by a little tar and some dead
grasshoppers.   I found that my aerial works ok,
but the the shaft is cracked so I have to locate
that part only.  One point of safety:  if you wash
it out under there, let it dry before turning the
key.  There is an exposed relay that made smoke
when I tested the aerial by turning on the radio.  I
didn't let it dry.  I dried it out and sprayed it with
plastic spray for distributors.

I also improved my cracked aerial operation and
made it easier for the motor by sanding it with
600 grit wet with WD40.

re: subject matter, is that gotta be about 928s
only enough fer ya?
