David, 

I seem to have hit a tender spot.  Do you own a $4600.00 Porsche Bicycle?
You dodged my comparison between Porsche designed watches and Casios. Also,
between Porsche Bicycles and Ferrari F50s. If I offended you, I apologize.
We all use words from time to time that may offend without meaning to.  I
drove and raced 356s and 911s and still think they're great cars; just not
my idea of great GT cars.  I never considered anyone who bought 911s as
being idiots.  I happen to be 6'2" and 200 pounds and even in my later
model 911s I was always banging my elbows or head on some interior part of
the car, but I still think that they're great cars, just not 928s, and its'
ludicrous to compare them.

Further, I did not trash any companies or "worshipers",  I merely said that
I don't worship at the Porsche altar. I don't sleep with a copy of
"Excellence" under my pillow.  I seriously doubt if there are any members
of this list who have driven 928s many more miles, and for as many years as
I have.  I didn't do it just for the hell of it, I did it because I'm
addicted to them.  That does not mean that I believe they have any
supernatural qualities, or that Jesus or Moses had a hand in their design.
They're just cars.  Possibly the very best cars; but just cars never the less.

 One last thing.  You said that you had never had any repair problems with
your 928s.  I notice that you have three of them.  If that statement is
true I can only surmise that you don't put very many miles on them, because
I've spent my share of money on them and from reading the daily journals of
this group, so have most of the other members. I've  had seven of them
since "77" and the cumulative repair costs on them over 350,000 miles would
make one hell of a down payment on a 996 Cabriolet.

Gene



As far as having a fleet of mechanics to care for my cars is concerned, I
lived and owned businesses in the four states I mentioned plus a couple of
others, and the only mechanic that ever ripped me off was right here in
South Florida, and he only did it once.  So much for that.
