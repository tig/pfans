928 fans,

High all, I've done it at last, I am now the proud owner of a stunning =
white GTS look, 89 S4 5spd.=20

I haven't had time to write to you until now, as I've been out driving =
it and showing it off to my friends and colleagues. It has attracted =
lots of admiring looks and I was able to re-enact a scene from "Risky =
business":-
I was waiting at some traffic lights and a hot hatch (small sporty =
hatchback) pulled up along side with two girls in it, one of them =
mouthed the words "nice car", when the lights went green I sat and =
watched them race away, I waited until they were a few car lengths ahead =
then floored it. Within seconds I shot past them, then backed off to =
honor the speed limit, with a huge grin on my face.

I am growing to like it more and more.

The car has done 168,000 Km (104,000 miles) and has been serviced every =
20,000 Km (12,000 miles), it has been in the UK for about two weeks. The =
only thing I have found that doesn't work is the headlamp height =
adjuster. The interior is virtually unmarked, half grey leather, it has =
also got the jack, spare wheel, electric tyre pump and a complete =
toolkit, the carpets are immaculate and the cargo net is still in the =
boot. It came complete with a mobile phone and a Sony 10 CD autochanger. =


I was amused to see the little air filter under the hood, which appears =
to filter the air going to the cooling fans. I presume this is to keep =
the engine free from dust and bugs, we don't want or engines getting =
dirty do we.

As discussed in previous postins, the dashboard language is in German =
and Kilometres. I have tried David Roberts mm_innov@earthlink.net =
suggestion: "On US spec cars this can be changed by pulling the computer =
lever towards you 2 times in 1 second, pull again for 3 seconds and it =
will revert back as before." but it didn't work. I'll have to enquire =
about the technique the Phil Tong kindly looked up, which involves using =
Porsche 'contact bridge 9293'.

Question: What are the front and rear bumper covers made of, I managed =
to crack one of the lower fins when a pheasant ran out in front of me. =
It looks like fibreglass, so I'll have to action a quick repair.

Best regards

Nigel,

Well done on the purchase! Hope all goes well and it is all you've
expected. Please mail the list your experience of collecting the car! It
sure does sound like a beauty. The price you mentioned a while back also
sounds like a good deal. I think I could live with the few minor
imperfections you mentioned in order to get the car.=20

What is the mileage like? How long has it been in the UK?=20

Anyway, I'm still hunting around, but at this stage it looks as if I
will still purchase overseas an import privately to Australia (and still
save about 5K ukpounds!).

Congrats. and keep in contact. Well done!
