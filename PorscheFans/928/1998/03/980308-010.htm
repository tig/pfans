Well , I 'll try to start this dialogue again:

I did not get an overwhelming response the first time on the 
list ( maybe I can't take a hint). I did replace the radio in my 
86 928s with  a  Blaupunkt Denver ( single CD) with remote from 
Crutchfield. The  installation was much more difficult.

After talking to several people about knowledgable installers in 
the area and  discussing different option with Crutchfield, the 
following were evident:

1. 	Porsche/ Blaupunkt radios are nearly impossible to alter 
in factory spec fashion. The local dealer does not outsource any 
work on new Porsches and will only deliver factory systems. If 
you desire alterations, they refer you to several local places 
but you are on your own.

Several high end places refuse to work on Porsche or make you 
sign a disclaimer and do not guarantee their work.


2.	If you want to replace the radio, Blaupunkt is not 
necessarily the easiest or best, but I chose it because of the 
quality and overall compatibility/look.	 

3	The factory setup is preamped and to install an isolated 
receiver unit you have to use an adapter to interface to  units 
speaker outs to the preamp inputs as well as fashioning a common 
ground. This is because of the DIN cable adapter used on MY86 ( 
and others?). This also involves using a power down relay to not 
blow the fuses on the preamp and th care.

4.	The alternative is to remove the preamp and wire 
directly to the speaker requiring new speaker wire, etc.

5.	Of course replacing with an original radio is an option 
for those seeking pure original effects. But for me, that's an 
expensive option for older technology.

The questions are:

How did Porsche handle later (or earlier) radio setups and can 
these be retrofitted to MY 86-87 etc.

How was the factory CD changer installed? Was a single CD 
receiver available, if so what model  and  can it be retrofitted 
to other years.

 
As I said, I opted for rewiring the speakers and bypassing the 
preamp with a Blaupunkt Denver w/ CD. I had the best local 
installer do the work  while I watched. It was very educational.
Total cost  about $300. 
The system sounds great so far.

The best part is the Denver has a programmable message  function 
which now greets me every morning with 
"Porsche. There is no substitute."
