Ken:

Happy to fill in some of the gaps, this from the truly afflicted ('79
grey market 928, '84 grey market XJ12).

The HE designation refers to the May cylinder head, May being a Swiss
engineer who created the High Energy combustion chamber configuration
back in the gas-crunch days.  The HE gets "somewhat" better mileage.  In
a 12 cylinder, this is rather moot, but the factory had to do something.
My Euro-spec car cites 299HP (SAE) from its 5.3 liters and gets 15mpg. 
Not sure if a non-HE motor is much different in the HP or mpg
departments.

Note that the tranny is a GM Turbo Hydromatic 3-speed with a truck
heritage.  It's bullet-proof.  Now, as to the electrical system, does
the name Lucas tell you anything?

As to that and other red flag areas on XJS's, you should contact fellow
928-lister Steve Gallant, who owns an XJS as well.  He's at
GallantCSC@aol.com.  He may see your post and respond directly.

'Course, if your wife REALLY wants to have fun, get her a 928!!
