Say, if they can  get 450hp out of the 911 engine why dont more people try to
get that much out of the 928 engines? I mean dotn they get like 800hp out of
nascar engines?, you know it seems that 928 owners arent like 911 owners,  I
mea you see 911 owner soupping up there car for racing, and obviously theres
the 911 twin turbo, and they do it with a smaller engine. There has been the
recent talk about the vipers, and I belive they have 400 and 450 hp so couldne
we keep up if we had the same? But like i was saying 928 owners dont seem to
want to do anyting drastic to there cars oh say like a twin turbo, 18 inch
wheels, carbonfiber/kevlar  parts; as most 928 owners are second owners, and
could not have afforded to buy the car when it was new, just wonder what
would be if all those 911 owners were driving 928s instead?
 Take for example that guy in the yellow GTS or S4 that wins races( you know
the guy with the hard to say name) why cant more people be like him?
