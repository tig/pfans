Hi P-Fans...  I have an '80 928 (5-speed) that despite my love for the car
needs to go...  Too many toys.  

Mileage:  67,xxx miles.
Location: Peoria, IL ...Yes, it does play in Peoria!

History:
 Original Owner: Purchased originally in Hawaii 
 Second Owner: Air Force officer that drove it coast to coast and claims it
never saw the rain (yeh sure!)
 Third Owner   : Springfield, Illinois insurance agent from 7/93 - 6/96.
 Fourth Owner:  ME!   (6/96 - present)

Chocolate Brown Exterior (rated an 8 out of 10)--plastic on nose and tail has
slightly faded (oxidized?) to a slighlty lighter shade of brown.   NO RUST!

Black Leather Int. (rated an 8 out of 10)--Only flaw is the leather around the
glove compartment has shrunk!  Seats are in excellent condition.

Maintenance Record:
Catalytic Converter-'86, Water pump-'88, Alternator-'91, A/C drier & System
checked/charged-'95, Timing Belt-'96 (Local porsche mechanic suggested I
needed to replace it shortly after I purchased the car. I did, and have the
old timing belt (and the receipt!) to prove it .  Turns out the old belt
looked almost brand new!), Clutch slave cyl and pressure hose-'96, Battery
'97.

Tires purchased new 2/20/95 at 56,000 miles  Excellent Condition with approx
11,000 miles on them.  Has original spare tire (never used) and original
electric air pump.

General Stuff:  '97 Kenwood Indash radio/cassette player coupled to a 10 disc
CD player.  (CD player on shelf under glovebox) / Bra and Mirror Covers /
Always garaged and stored winters (at least by me and immediate prior owner)
             
First $8,000 takes it.  If you are interested or have questions, please let me
know.
