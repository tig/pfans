Hi all, 

I'm re-sending this 'cause I don't think it got through the first time 
(if it did, sorry).

Thought I'd relate what I've been up to lately, as a couple of people
have asked (thanks for the interest, Greg S. and Jerry V.).

Well, my project started out, innocently enough, as an attempt to fix
the fluid leak coming from the front of my auto. transmission.  I'm now
about a month into it, and it has significantly expanded itself. (The
project, not the leak). ;-)

It's one of those typical "while you're in there" sort of situations.
The whole drive-train (NOT engine though), exhaust system, the entire
rear suspension, and part of the front suspension is now out of the car,
and the engine oil pan is hanging down with all the bolts removed,
waiting to come off.  =:-o

Why, you might ask?  Because I just love to take things apart and put
them back together again for no reason!  NOT!  (Actually, I kinda do...
I used to bring home old junked TV's when I was a kid, and...  well,
that's another story).

No, seriously, you have to remove the exhaust system and the entire rear
suspension to get the auto trans out.  Then I thought, "Gee, there's
only 4 bolts holding the torque tube to the engine, maybe I should take
it out too and see if the bearings are ok, WHILE I HAVE IT APART".  (I
had been hearing some whining noises from under there occasionally, so
this seemed reasonable).  Off came the lower half of the engine
bell-housing too.

Next, I thought I'd check out the leaky gasket around the engine oil
pan.  In doing so, I discovered that the rear main crankshaft seal was
leaking as well.  I thought, "Well, WHILE IT'S APART, all I need to do
is remove the flywheel to get at the seal."  Well, I also had to take
the top half of the engine bell-housing off to get the flywheel off.
Ok, no big deal.

So..., I took the front part of the trans apart, removed the torque
convertor, etc., and figured out what parts I needed to order.  I also
discovered that one of the axle flanges was leaking too, so WHILE IT'S
APART, I figured I might as well order the seals and do both sides.  Of
course new fluid, filter, pan gasket, and other ods and ends were needed
as well.

Then I thought, "Well, while I'm waiting for parts, and the car's up on
jack stands, now would be a good time to replace the front shocks, which
I've been wanting to do ('cause they really need it).  I've also been
wanting to update to the adjustable spring perches, so I could lower the
car slightly (mine just seems a bit higher in the front than most of the
others I saw at the frenzy) and just basically have the adjustable
capability to match the back, so I can eventually corner balance the
car.

WELL, it turns out that (after I had already bought the used adjusters)
you need the shorter front springs from the later car as well!  And that
will only put the car about where it was before, no lower.  Ok, now I
need lowering springs.  Found a second hand set (new), and decided to
use the old trick of putting the stock front springs in the rear
(thanks, David Roberts, for reminding me about this).  But they're so
short, I'm afraid now that the rear of the car will look too low.  I
then came up with the idea of putting a spacer between the shock
mounting ring and the threaded tube to raise it up a little.  A piece of
2" dia. galvanized pipe from the hardware store slides over the Koni
shock perfectly, I just need to cut the length to whatever I want (maybe
about an inch).

Anyway, I've gotten the parts I ordered (thanks, Susan @ DEVEK), and am
now working on getting everything back together.  Most everything has
now been cleaned, and some items painted, as necessary.  Oh yeah, the
torque tube rebuild is another story for later...

Well, gotta get home and get greasy!
