Ed,

  Optimally, you would want a 4 or 5 point harness to keep you firmly planted
  in the seat.  Devek now sells their harness bar which should make mounting
  the shoulder straps very easy.  Between the harness bar and a good cam-lock
  harness, you're probably looking at ~$250.
  
  I haven't put a harness in my car yet, so I use the $5 solution.  Get a
  hold of one of those H-shaped clips that are used to secure a child's
  car seat.  When you get in your car and adjust everything for the proper
  driving position, snug up your seat belt and install the clip next to
  the release latch.  This works quite well.

  Read lots of cool books on proper driving techniques!  Bob Bondaurant's
  is good and so is Jackie Stewart's (if you can see past his oft inflated
  opinion of himself).  Skip Barber used to have a good 30-minute video
  available and there was another that was narrated by Mario Andretti 
  (Driving to Win(?)) that had some good techniques.
  
  The very best preparation is to attend a professional driving school
  like Bondaurant or Skip Barber.  These are worth every penny of their
  somewhat steep admission cost.
