I wasn't trying to drive anyone away. I sure hope no one ended up
thinking that.

I missed a great deal of the original thread. It said (and I quote)
"We race 3 cars with them."  Patrick's feable mind questions, with whom?
"All have had line failures." Hmmm... nothing hear clarifying what
type of line failed...and as I look up thru preamble, there's no
mention of stainless. Must be stock rubber hoses.

Yes, the subject was S/S brake lines, but...

The preamble did not clarify this. --> "The following was posted by
Kevin Gross, who Knows Whereof He Speaks even if he does drive a 944,
regarding brake lines."  

It has already been determined that _I_ have my head up my ass, but
shouldn't those last three words have been expanded to say 
"regarding S/S brake lines"?

My ASSumption: brake lines fail (not specified as S/S, so must be stock)
My solution: get S/S
Kevin's observations: S/S sucks, no performance gain, dangerous.
                                                      ^^^^^^^^^
[At that point, I should have filled in the blanks and recognized
that the entire post was talking about S/S brake line failures and
not stock brake line failures. Sorry, I failed.]

My argument: I disagree. S/S makes the braking more responsive.

But then again, I know nothing about the performance improvements on a
car. All I've ever experienced is the VERY NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE when
S/S lines are installed on a motorcycle. Maybe I get better feedback
through the fingers?

So, now I'm actually suprised and stunned by this revelation. The S/S
lines that I got _are_ DOT approved. Does this mean that they've been
thoroughly tested and proven to be safe from the S/S failures that
Kevin mentions? Performance sells a set of S/S brake lines for the
928. These are pretty cheap...$60 for the set of 4. The add also
fine-print states that these are "pending DOT approval". The lines that
I got cost me almost $100. That was a smokin' deal because I called 
Russell and the retail was around $180!
