Working in conjunction with tire makers, Porsche has developed a set of
specifications for tires for Porsche cars. I'm currently aware of N0, N1,
N2, and N3 specs. Porsche states emphatically (bold and all caps in the
Technical Bulletin I'm looking at) that you must not mix specification
numbers on any one car; in other words, all tires must have the same
specification number.

The only tires available to these specs are ones developed for OEM fitment
to Porsches, and it's frequently the case that a tire model which Porsche
does use is available both in Porsche spec and generic spec (no N number),
so you'll need to ask for, and be sure you get, the Porsche spec version.
The fine print after tire sizes in Tire Rack's ads and Web site
(http://www.tirerack.com) will show the specification number, as will
molded-in characters on the tire's sidewall.

I don't know (there, I've said it!) exactly what these specs dictate, but
they appear to deal with steering response, rolling resistance, and
behavior at very high speed. Since there are Porsche-spec tires available
at a wide range of prices (least expensive I know of currently is the
Bridgestone RE71; the other end of the scale contains the Michelin Pilot SX
MXX3, Bridgestone Potenza S-02, and Pirelli PZero), I don't see any
compelling reason not to use them.
