HI All!

Just test drove an 86 shark (SN <1000), meteor metallic/maroon, with
156K miles, 5speed manual.  Just had new timing belt and water
pump installed.  Exterior paint is original and excellent.

By my observations, it has the following problems:

1) recent history of overheating: Gaudin Ford/Porshe recommends new
radiator at $1K  Some minor floating brown gunk was noted in the
coolant reservoir.
2) mechanical fan clutch suspected bad
3) Gaudin Ford/Porsche recommended replacement of oil lines to
cooler (leaks)
4) Some minor vibration of unknown origin (not noticed by current
owner), seemed too    high in frequency to be related to wheel balance
 issues..... drive shaft/tube ?

No information regarding engine compression.  Engine seemed
strong during a test drive.  Everything else about the car
seemed in very good shape for the number of miles.

Questions:

a)  Anyone have experience with cooling system problems, particularly
flushing out crud resulting from potentially the wrong antifreeze used
by
a PO?  They added an electric fan in front of the radiator to alleviate
overheating (this IS Las Vegas after all....)
c)  As this was my first drive of a 5speed manual, I wasn't sure if long

clutch travel is normal (clutch engages with clutch pedal approximately
2/3 out)
c)  The asking price of $8900 OBO seems a bit high....comments?

Thanx one and all!
