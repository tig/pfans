Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

    As others have previously mentioned, SS brake lines do not yield or
"swell" as much as OEM rubber lines under extreme pressure and repeated
applications. However, the way they are constructed may lead to premature
sudden failure, and there is no way to tell if and when that can or will
occur. 
    Basically, each line is a teflon tube surrounded by SS. The SS will not
break, but it can be abraded or worn if it rubs against another metal part
on the car. The teflon tube has been known to crack, and thus cause a sudden
leak of brake fluid, usually when it is needed most. Early designs were more
susceptible to failure than more recent ones.

If you plan to do track events, the confidence one gets from a firmer brake
pedal makes it worth using them. It is recommended that they be replaced
every two or three years to be safe. I've had mine for two years and will
replace them soon.

Happy motoring. Ed
