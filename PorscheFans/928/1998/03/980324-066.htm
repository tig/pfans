FWIW I've seen quite a few 928s running 245's on the
narrower flat wheels, I guess to emulate the dished S4 rear
tire spec.  Leonard's advice is sound and I'd follow it,
plus you'll be able to rotate tires.  And I suppose you saw
the couple of for sale posts that just went by on 928 wheels
too, right?

For a real graphic representation of wheel offsets, and how
dynamic body movement is at speed, check out the photos of
Mark Anderson's race car in the latest european car
magazine.  See the static stance, then see what happens to
the fronts during cornerig?  Wild huh!?!  Note also that
he's running incredibly stiff race springs too!

What kind of tires are you considering?
