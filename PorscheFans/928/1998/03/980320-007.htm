Looks like my passenger side (left) window motor is in need of 
replacement.  The window goes down no problem but has to be really 
helped back up....so the question is:

Is replacement an easy job, or does it involve glass removal, fine 
adjustment blah blah yadda yadda?

How easy is it to strip the door trim? Does this require any special 
pulling tools?  Once that's off, is it just a question of unplugging and 
unbolting the old one and installing the new?

I'm something of a coward where the major components of my car is 
concerned - I would never tackle anything under that flap at the front 
of the car between the headlights (I wonder what's in there come to 
think of it), but I reckon I could do the window with the list's help.

My labour is considerably cheaper than my local main dealer's, even if 
Samantha, the service manager, is drop-dead gorgeous.

Anyone any experience?  (With the window motor, I mean)

Dan.
