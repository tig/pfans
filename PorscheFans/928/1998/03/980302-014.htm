Nope. To quote Porsche's 1987 model year US sales brochure:

	The original 928 swept the European Car of the Year nominations.
	The second, "S" edition of 4 years ago brought more power, even
	more precise handling, even more luxury. The third, 4-valve-per-
	cylinder edition of two years brought a dramatic increase in the
	total performance of this automobile. Now to mark the 928's
	Tenth Anniversary, Porsche designers and engineers proudly present
	their fourth edition 928, the "928 S4"...

>Hence no S3.

	From the above, it would be fair to assign that designation to the '85-86
four-valve cars (US, Japan, Canada, and, for '86, Australia), but I haven't
seen any badges or paperwork with that designation. It's reasonable, it's
descriptive, but it's unofficial.

>This is for the UK. YM (in the USA) MV.

No cars of Porsche's "third edition" went to the UK, but you got plenty of
what might be called "S2" cars, all labeled "S", with higher peak
horsepower than the S3s.

Time for the next topic.
