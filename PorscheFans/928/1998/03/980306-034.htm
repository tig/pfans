Hi all,

Finally got a chance to put the car up and fix a few
things.  Found a missing sway-bar mounting bolt too! 
Thought I was helping things in general until I got
home, turned the headlights off, and it died after
idling for about 6 seconds.  Now it won't restart.  It
hit once, nevermore.  Go figure!  The most work that
I've done to it so far and now this.  At least it got
me home. Glad it's almost the weekend so I can figure
it out.  I thought it was all too good.

I noticed the motor mount brackets on both engine sides
seem to be missing bolts all around.  There is a metal
bracket or strap that goes on the tops of motor mounts,
front to back.  They seem to have four bolts each, two
on the front, two on the back of each mount.  On my car
there is only one short bolt on the front and one on
the back of each strap.  There appears to be a missing
bolt beside each of the short bolts. They would be
about 5" long, 8mm, go through the strap first (on the
bottom), up through the motor casting (that must be the
bearing ladder), and another motor casting (I think). 
Not too clear now.  What do you think? 

Thanks,
Dave Ladd
