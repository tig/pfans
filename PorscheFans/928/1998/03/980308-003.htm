Jim,
Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner....
Yes, got them from Vertex. (It is apparently a 911 part also...)
Made by Weltmeister, the part # is 911.424.223.03.......$15.90.

Yes, (it is locktited) it was very tite, and I had to heat it to remove.
With a little heat it removed easily.

I got lucky and my boot was in good shape and didn't rip.

You make some good points about the "play" by design. (the manuals also state
this fact) I spoke to Marc at Devek about this also, and without it the car
could potentially shift (or try to) with your hand on the shifter, over a hard
bump. This could also lead to increased shift fork and synchro wear.
(Incidentally, it's not good practice to drive with your hand resting on the
shifter all the time)
    
>    Let us know how the installation goes.

You asked for it!......The new bushing holes were about the same size as the
originals, (which you've already correctly deduced) however, the side to side
clearance is tight with the new bushings. (in fact, tight enough so that the
fore/aft hole clearance is not so much an issue and no longer sloppy) I think
the Weltmeister bushings were a little more of a compression fit into the
coupler, thus making the hole a little less elongated fore/aft, and the web to
keep the bushing from turning in the coupler, (and also limit side to side
play) was also .040" thicker than the original/worn bushings. 
I scribed exact location of the shift coupler to shift rod orientation, before
removal.
The coupler goes up against the shift rod, so fore/aft was not an issue.
The pin drives out of the coupler by resting the aluminum coupler side with
the 4 nubs down. Re-assembly was a snap, and orientation perfect.
I also replaced the front shift cup. Mine wasn't worn badly, but I already had
the new part. (sorry--no part # for whoever asked about it) I took some
calipers and measured  
exactly the distance from the locknut to the cup and scribed a line for
orientation axially. I used a leather belt around the cup to pull it down onto
the ball. This required a bit of brute strength and bracing of my knees
against the underbody. 
The shifter linkage re-assembly was a pain, and would not have been possible
without the ol' bondage of the springs with dental floss trick per Kurt
Gibble's procedure. Thanks Kurt! I was sure fore/aft cup posistion was perfect
because of the matching of the above caliper readings, and I double checked to
be sure that when the shifter was in it's full side to side posistions that
the shift cup had clearance between it and the ball base. The shifter has the
specified 87.5% rearward inclination and the 2-3% leftward inclination.
My shifter now feels like a precision instrument, and is much, much better.
And remember, it didn't really feel bad at all before. I was mostly measuring
any slop before as strictly a fore/aft thing, but now side to side and
fore/aft feels fantastic!
And the shortened shifter says "snick, snick, snick, snick, snick."

Ted,

What do you mean about being carefull with the hose clamp?? 
Could I have been over-zealous with the leather belt / brute force method?
