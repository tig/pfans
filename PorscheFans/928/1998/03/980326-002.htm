Hi my name is David and I'm new at responding to this list.  I have
followed the different topics each week for the past 2 months and have
learned a great deal from them all.  After looking and sitting in an 84
my love for this car drew so strong and at that time I only wished I was
old enough to drive....    Now its  time for me to start looking for that
perfect or almost perfect 928S.  Recently  I missed a deal on a 1983S
with only 53k on it.  It was in perfect condition.  And  I can't believe
I found it in a Nissan dealership!  The prices they were asking for those
new cars couldn't even come close to the quality and value I saw in this
928S..   So I left a second deposit on it ( they were asking only$8700.00
).  Unfortunately the first person to leave a deposit on it bought it.  
I will always remember the car's condition  and will use this car as a
comparison to what it's condition should be in when well cared  for.  
One of my new finds is an 88S4 with 100k. Less $$ then that of the 83....
The problem here is that it has rear end damage and needs the
bumper,hatch and glass replaced the guy tells me over the phone.  I would
like any comments on maybe someones experience in restoring such a
damaged car in this area, the rear,  and would like to know if an earlier
928 bumper, preS4 style could be used as a replacement since this is the
design I love the most.  If I do find this car to be the one for me I'm
sure my real driving experience will begin now .   It's an auto( not my
first choice but fine).   Any comments, suggestions  would be great
Thanks.
