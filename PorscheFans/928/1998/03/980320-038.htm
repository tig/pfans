I need to apologize here to Mark at 928 International for implying the life 
time of one of his rebuilt tubes, which was not my intent. There is 
physical evidence that the tube was incorrectly installed. The bolt at the 
back was not seated in the grove and so, the shaft slipped and spun inside 
the coupling.
Mark has been extremely helpful in educating me since the repair, and it 
would have been much easier to talk to him before I fixed it, and not 
after.

Again, my apologies,

Subject:	RE: Your repairs to your 928

I bought my 89 S4 last November. It had a rumbling noise like an exhaust 
rattle at low RPMs in park or neutral. Odds were it was the torque tube, 
but I was in denial. The noise would come and go, and twice it actually 
became a LOAD thumping. Turning the car off and back on would make it go 
away. Anyway, eventually it broke, stripping what turned out to be a 928 
International rebuild, at the back end, along with the fitting at the 
transaxle.

	Costs were $1500 for a new tube, and $400 for the spline attachment at the 
back, $70 for the bearings in the transaxle bell housing and $800 labor.
	Notes: The tube from Porsche is $1800 (Auto) and $1500 (Manual). They are 
different, the manual is longer, with three bearings. As well, the fitting 
is $500 (Auto) and ($400 Manual). For some reason, I got charged the manual 
price, and I didn't ask too many questions. Also, Brumos charged over $1000 
labor to put the rebuild in, according to records, so your mileage may 
vary.
	Rebuilds are about $800, from a number of sources, but the one that was in 
there only lasted 15,000 miles. The drive shaft was good and stripped, and 
the shaft itself slid easily through the bearings in the tube, which it is 
not supposed to do. Also, check your fittings at both ends to make sure 
that they are not stripped or damaged.
	The exhaust had to come out, of course. The nose of the transaxle was 
dropped to get the bell housing off. I took lots of pictures, and I'll post 
them or make them available at my site, if anybody is interested.

	It's nice and quiet, but I'm broke. 8-)

Steve,

As far as the shocks go, I bought mine from Paragon Products in Texas.
They advertise in Panorama (I can get you the # if you need it).  I
think they were around $150 each, but I don't remember exactly. Their
prices are in the ad.  They do advertise "lowest prices on Koni" and "we
will not be undersold on Koni", but check around and see (if you're
interested in Konis).  I bought Konis for my 914 from them also, a few
years ago; good service and quick turn-around.

There's only one Koni for the 928, the "red" (more like orange).
Unfortunately, it's NOT externally adjustable, but IS internally
adjustable.  It has to be removed from the car, and separated from the
spring, and the piston rod pushed all the way in, to adjust it (a pain).
But it IS guaranteed for life (life of the car it's installed in, I
guess).

Having said that, DEVEK does make a shock/spring package with Konis
which I think ARE externally adjustable.  I think they have them
specially made.  Expensive, but probably worth it.

R/R'ing the front shocks is straight forward, but you'll probably loose
some knuckle flesh (as Greg S. says).  You have to remove the two nuts
holding the upper control arm to the body (in the engine compartment) in
order to pull the upper control arm out enough to get the shock out, and
those nuts are somewhat difficult to get to.

The top three nuts on the shock tower come off, and the through bolt on
the bottom, and the shock/spring assembly is free.  All you have to do
is fanagel (sp?) the disconnected upper control arm and the shock/spring
assembly around until you can get it out, without damaging the upper
ball joint or boot, brake line, messing up your undercoating, or having
the wheel hub/spindle flip over into your lap (that sucker's heavy!).
Gettin' it back in there is even more fun!  It's really not that hard,
just a PAIN.

I thought I read in here a while ago that someone suggested it was
easier to remove the bottom control arm from the body to get the
shock/spring assembly out.  Well I tried that first, and let me tell
'ya, ain't no way in _ell it was commin' out of my car that way!  Just
didn't work for me.  Try it if you want...  YMMV.

You'll also obviously need a coil spring compresser to separate the
spring and shock once you get it out.  Be careful here, this can be VERY
DANGEROUS.

date on the blackboards again and again, and asked the children to
memorize it with pride and joy:  1492    The teachers told the children
that this was when their continent was discovered by human beings.
Actually, millions of human beings were already living full and
imaginative lives on the continent in 1492.  That was simply the year in
which sea pirates began to cheat and rob and kill them."  -Kurt
