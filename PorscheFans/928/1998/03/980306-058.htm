	Well, then;
	
	I stand Corrected.  I don't know how long "same lane"  has been around, but it's been 5 or more years since I've done alot of Highway travelling. As a matter of fact, I don't even have a Radar detector anymore.

	Michigan must make alot of revenue off of tickets, to invest in the time/effort in training officers in the CORRECT method of using this thing. I don't know, but I would bet that it is much more likely to beat a "same lane" ticket in court. Based on your explanation it would appear that an accurate reading is that much more difficult to obtain. Especially since the officer must make "JUDGEMENTS" that factor heavily in the accuracy of the radar unit's reading.
	I thought getting rid of human error was the purpose of moving to automated detection devices in the first place. Now your telling me that I have the opportunity to dispute a ticket again, based on operator error? In this case I would never pay a "same lane" ticket without fighting it.

	In my college years, I used a radar detector and can probably count on one hand the number of times it actualy saved me from a ticket. Of course back then PASSPORTS were not affordable to the average college student, and Valentine didn't exist, but with the advent of "Instant On" Radar, my confidence in Radar detectors basicly wanned anyway. I got hit twice, on two different occasions in Mississippi by a crafty Instant On operator, and neither time did my DECENT detector save me from a ticket. Since then I've just slowed down (Yeah, right!!)
Actually I just speed less frequently and rarely at night.

	It's all a matter of preference, but If you think those things make you "safer",  then....God Bless!

	I think you'de do better coating your car with radar absorbing material like the stealth fighter has. :-)
