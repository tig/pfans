I've got a glimpse of a beautiful 928 a few times now and it's really an
eye-catcher - A Guards Red S4.

Today, I was shocked to find upon closer examination it... it,  had green
growth all over it!  Arghh!  It just looked like no one had maintained it
for months.  How could someone do this to this car?!?  The rear left tire
needs some more pressure too.  Oh yeah, another bad sign - children's toys
inside.  I was surpised the interior wasn't shredded!  It looked pretty
nice actually, black leather!

Anyone own this car on the list?  Located in Bellevue, WA - I always see it
parked by Jack in the Box.
Oh yeah, I forgot to see if it was a manual or automatic - so despite the
moss, I'll have to check next time!
