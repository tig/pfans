I have a 1985 928-S, and these little buggers made a nice little nest in 
the engine compartment.  Last time this happened, they got all the way down 
through the filter and screen, all the way inside (before dying) Yuck!

This time though, it was only a hose (so I thought).  Upon looking down 
past the air mixture pipes? (big silver tubes center top of engine) there 
seems to be a black wire that attaches right next to a big pipe at the 
center of the engine that has been chewed off...

What might this wire be for?  Is it still able to drive to the shop or 
should towing be the only option at this point.  I'll take a guess and say 
that those pipes aren't the easiest things to get off for a less than 
average mechanical guy.  How do I keep these guys away in the future?  I 
sealed up the area, put mothballs everywhere, removed anykind of food or 
seeds... they just love this car as much as I do.

I'll look forward to hearing any suggestions, as I do all of the posts 
here.
