Phil, lenn, and Who ever is interested.
Len is right, you cant mout the S4 stock tire to the 7 "rim.
However, you CAN mourt a 245x50x16 on the 7" rim and it works =

very well.  Safe and endorsed by tire rack
The tire set up looks better than the stock set up on the S4 because the
tire fills out the wheel well
nicely, and has a more aggressive rear look.   I have 4 best friends who
have the S4 and agree after  a rear view comp.   No tread bending, or
unusual side wall buldge.   Ive gone to the track several times with this=

set up and It has performed better than the stock tire size did on my 84
28.  (same tire manufacturer, goodyear)
now have logged over 60kmiles with this above set up and now have gone to=

17s with R1s.
   Tire roll is not a problem for the rears as was mentioned
in a earlier email.  Braking under turning condition is the most stressfu=
ll
condition for the sidewall of a front tire.
rears never can generate the type of conditions that a front tire can, as=

braking hp is over 1000 hp over all 4 wheels  and acceratiing  HP is unde=
r
400 on only the rears.   (So accellerating in a turn wont get even close =
to
the side presures that the fronts get during braking).   (the fronts are
multi directional whearas the rears are fixed and usually =

slid around in a turn with little or no force on them.) =

As a note, the tire is only 1/2 " taller and almost 3/4" wider.  =
