Ain't it the truth!?!

I don't even think I'd want to listen to a V12 unless it was
at full song. Viper's are pretty uninspiring 'woom' wise. 
American V8's are nice but all too familiar.  The Porsche V8
is just something else.  With the bypass I find it the most
'musical' right between 2k and 3k rpm's, past that it is all
business.  

The most unique engine I ever heard was a big block Chevelle
(bear with me).  It was equipped with thin wall stainless
headers, H-pipe and turbo mufflers.  Heavily cammed too.  At
it's stuttering idle those header pipes would ring notes I
swear!  It wasn't a loud car (unless on the gas) but boy did
it sound pretty.

I need another road trip!
Phil
