When I was slightly more involved in Lotus ownership we had a little group
of Esprit owners who used to get together for a drive in the country a
couple of times a year.  One of the guys was telling us about a fright he
got one night.

They were sitting in their dining room, which had a doorway through into
the garage, late one night when they heard a muffled "thump, thump, thump"
coming from the garage.  Ian picked up a baseball bat and ventured
nervously down the stairs.  He could see some movement near the front of
the Esprit and he turned the garage light on to find...

The Esprit sitting there with it's headlights happily popping up and
shutting again and again.  The motor that raises and lowers the lights on
an S1 Esprit runs a little crank and only travels in one direction, and the
contacts on the limit switch that stops the motor when the lights are down
had failed, leaving the little motor running and the car apparently
fluttering its eyelids at Ian.

They DO have personalities, don't they!
