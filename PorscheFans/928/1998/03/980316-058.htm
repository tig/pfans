Yah!  I think David's instructions were to go from metric to standard
measurements not to change languages.  I usually do the double pull,
didn't know about the 3 second hold...

Just want to repeat this:  Test pipes, or cat bypass pipes, are simply
plain exhaust pipe - straight through etc.  Sole purpose is to replace
the 'restrictive' catalytic converter.  Some like the new exhaust roar,
others do not.  I wasn't particularly thrilled myself on the '84 - I got
really used to and liked the way the factory exhaust sounded.  (All 928s
sound different too among the various models). 

I heard Elliot's S4 with the muffler bypass and liked it alot, blipping
the throttle in the parking lot.  Close to a header & sport muffler
equipped car even (read as slightly raspy and loud).  Don't know about
highway droning though and for sure any stealth factor is lost.  No
vendor claims of power effects - it is just a "fun" mod to do and
totally reversible back to stock.  If you try this with a bypass pipe it
will be *too loud* but then again you might like
that?

Finally, the O2 sensor can be hard to spot.  It lives on top of the
cat!  Only way to get to it easily is to drop the exhaust down...

Whups, enough I am starting to ramble!  Love these cars!
