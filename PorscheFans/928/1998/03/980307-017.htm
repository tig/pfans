Okay....gotta add my .02 worth!    None of the 'value rating' guides
determine price.   As we all know, price is determined completely,
totally, and unilaterally by whatever someone is willing to pay.   My
ten year old just learned this by trading in three beanie babies for
which we paid $5.49 each a couple of years ago - and got (hold
on........) $265 for the lot.   It was a local store expecting to resell
for a profit.    I don't get it, but hey, she was able to convert the
demand and rarity of those three cleverly sewn bags into cash - which
she will now use to purchase her very first stocks (that's another
story).

The value books are good to establish loan values, insurance values, and
as a general guide.   There are always vehicles where the market value
is not reflected in The Books (vettes, rarities, special editions,
etc.).   Anyhow, the point here is that I've learned not to get so upset
when book value is out of whack with market value.   I agree with
whoever suggested using Edmunds, KBB, local trader magazines, and want
ads as good places to start.

Now, I gotta run off and make my daughter as rich as possible, because
I'm planning to be a burden to her in my twilight years!
