>     Okay, question of the day:
>     
>     
>     UP-FIXIN der PORSCHE (Panorama publications)
>     Volume VII
>     
>     There are several article of interest to 928 owners:
>     TECH article on the 1985-1986 engine.
>     TECH article on the S4 engine. 
>     Setting a 928 up for autocross
>     
>     My question references page 332, and a picture with a caption 
>     the following:
>        
>     "1983 928 Le Mans. A completely stock 928S was entered
>     at Le Mans in 1983 by Gonin, Boutinaud and Le Page. It 
>     was still running at the end but did not complete enough
>     laps to qualify as a finisher". I note the side outlet exhaust
>     and Mahle ??? wheels.    
>     
>     Can anyone provide more information. As this being true would 
>     further the testament to quality of this Porsche marque. 
>
>     -----------------------------------------------------------------     
>     I find the lack of coverage in this country (even by magazines 
>     specializing in European Racing/Automobiles) on the 24 hours of
>     Le Mans and even Daytona staggering, the importance of these events 
>     to  companies like Porsche and other European marques that 
>     eventually ends up in the products we drive should inspire the 
>     interest of everyone. That "what they race today we drive 
>     tomorrow" concept is the platform that made Porsche, Ferrari, BMW 
>     and many more the envy of this industry. "come on magazines lets 
>     get with it. One of the reasons I quit European Car and also
>     to much focus on hot-rodding BMW's (which are great cars).
