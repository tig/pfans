Need vs. have to can be two different things.  So far there's no
consensus as to how long a rattling tube will last, or what happens
should it fail (depending on failure mode). One car is reported to have
destroyed the automatic trans guts but no details as far as speed at
time of failure, etc.  We really do need to hear more about this.

I'm guessing that just one bearing is loose allowing the drive shaft
freeplay inside the tube.  My old '84 has a similiar noise and is still
going today, no change as far as I've heard from the current owner.  I
can only offer that the car withstood daily use, dyno time, a few passes
down the dragstrip and a few high speed blasts without incident - YMMV.

There are used tubes for $350 from a variety of sources, try EASY in
Emeryville, CA.  Rebuilts are much higher starting around $1200 I
believe, check with Mark Anderson at 928 International.  8-10 hours of
labor sounds about right, don't know how much of this is DIY, I think
working with only jacks and a jackstand will prove to be difficult by
yourself.

Good luck, let us know how you make out,
Phil Tong
