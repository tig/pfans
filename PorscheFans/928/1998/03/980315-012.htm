>2. I noticed Phil's comment about the dash: "Note the readouts can be
>set for english, french, german in addition to US mph or r.o.w. kph etc."
>Phil, do you or any body else know how to do this, as the computer dash on
my proposed 928 is all in >German and KPH, the only item I'd be left with is
the KPH calibrated analogue speedometer dial.

 On US spec cars (have heard this will also work on some ROW cars) this can
be changed by pulling the computer lever towards you 2 times in 1 second,
pull again for 3 seconds and it will revert back as before.

>3. I posted a request recently on how to disable the catalytic converter,
which it has been suggested is breaking up, one scare story is that
fragments of ceramic could be sucked back into the engine. I have received
the following suggestion:
>a. Remove the catalyst section of the exhaust and knocking out the ceramic
catalyst with a rod or rubber mallet, then refit the empty pipe.
>b. Some people say, that the Oxygen sensor then needs to be disabled, does
anyone know the procedure for >this?

Quote form Porsche 89 Information Technik service booklet " Same power
output with and without catalytic converter". The 89 and up 928s were some
of the first cars to develop the same power with and without the cats. Why
bother unless you cat is stopped up. Of course if you are going to be racing
the car I would remove it because of the excessive heat from the cat at
sustained high rpms.

Concerning the O2 sensor, it is an important part of the sophisticated
computer engine management system and will not allow this system to operate
properly without it. Since the computers use input from the O2 sensor to
adjust fuel mixtures etc. for optimum mixtures in real time, you could
theoretically cause too rich or too lean conditions for your engine (not a
good thing).
