Gene,

I can appreciate your derring-do, but the story about your flying
experience gives me shivers.  There are four Marine fliers facing court
martial and possible prison sentences because they were participating in
similar "fun" activities resulting in the deaths of 20 Italian skiers.

I enjoy the performance aspects of my 928 as much as anyone else;
however, I try hard not to endanger anyone else while I am driving it.
When I lived (and drove) in Saudi Arabia I would frequently see many
pseudo-Emerson Fittipaldis driving at speeds well in excess of 100 mph
in town, weaving all over the road to pass on the left, right, or
straight up the middle. My prayer was always that these south ends of
north-bound horses would kill themselves before they killed someone
else.

At high speeds it doesn't take much of an error (human, mechanical, or a
violation of the laws of physics) for innocent fun to turn deadly.

I'm hardly innocent myself...early-on I had my shark up to 145 mph more
than once, and used to enjoy seeing a frustrated young Saudi in his
Honda Accord struggling vainly to keep up with me as I pulled away in
3rd and continued accelerating. I would like to think I have gotten over
that in 8 years, although the temptation to "punch it" does come to me
at times.

I know I'm going to get flamed by a bunch of  people. So be it. But if
you've been around long enough to save the money to buy a really fine
automobile you should also have the judgement not to endanger others on
the highway...even that snot-nosed, pimply-faced spoiled brat in the
Mustang who just waved a one-digit salute at you as he went by.

Just my zwei pfennigs worth.

Mike Sawran
