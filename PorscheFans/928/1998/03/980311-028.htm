The ABSOLUTE WORST things to say to a police officer:

 -Sorry, Officer, I didn't realize my radar detector wasn't plugged in.

 -Aren't you the guy from the Village People?

 -Hey, you must've been doin' about 125 mph to keep up with me! Good
job!

 -Excuse me. Is "stick up" hyphenated?

 -I thought you had to be in relatively good physical condition to be a
  police officer.

 -I was going to be a cop, but I decided to finish high school instead.

 -Bad cop! No donut!

 -You're not gonna check the trunk, are you?

 -Gee, that gut sure doesn't inspire confidence.

 -Wow, you look just like the guy in the picture on my girlfriend's
  nightstand.

 -Is it true that people become cops because they are too dumb to
work at McDonald's?

 -I pay your salary!

 -So, uh, you on the take, or what?

 -Gee, Officer! That's terrific. The last officer only gave me a
warning,
  too!

 -Do you know why you pulled me over? Okay, just so one of us does.

 -I was trying to keep up with traffic. Yes, I know there is no other
car around-that's how far ahead of me they are.

 -What do you mean, "Have I been drinking?" You're the trained
specialist.

 -Well, when I reached down to pick up my bag of crack, my gun fell
off my lap and got lodged between the brake pedal and the gas pedal,
forcing me to speed out of control.

 -Hey, is that a 9 mm? How's that compare to this one here?

- I can't reach my license unless you hold my beer.

- That uniform makes your butt look really big.

- Didn't I see you get your ass kicked on Cops?

- I bet I could grab that gun before you finish writing my ticket

- And that hooker I met at the AIDS clinic said you were a nice guy.

- When you smack the crap outta me, make sure you smile pretty for
the camcorder.

- Those sirens are hurting my ears, turn them off or I'm not speaking
to you.

- Sorry I can't hear you over the radio. No I am not turning it down;
I love this song.   Either speak up or just leave me alone.

- Hey, can you give me another one of those full cavity searches?
