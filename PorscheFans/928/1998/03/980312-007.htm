Depending on your newsreader, you may need to do a "Refresh Groups", 
"Reset List", or similar command for it to pick up the newest additions.
If you do that and still don't see it, contact your ISP (Internet Service 
Provider).  That's the people you pay for your internet connection. Ask 
them to pick it up.  
As far as I know, every ISP has a guy who decides which NG's to carry 
on their server.  It's usually not a problem to get them to pick it up.  
They just don't normally carry them all.  
Tuesday, when I rec'd confirmation from my ISP that the NG had been 
created, I called it up and there were no messages.  So, I posted one.  
When I re-checked the NG to see the message, there was another one 
there from a guy in Sweden.   So, evidently, his ISP in Sweden picked 
it up immediately.  My ISP guy told me that some of the news servers 
are automated to pick up every new NG.  Some others have to be 
prompted.
Hope to see you there.
