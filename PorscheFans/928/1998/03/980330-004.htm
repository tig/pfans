Hi Howard,

I can think of two things that could make those meaty rotors warp. First,
if you have had them resurfaced a bunch of times they could be below the
minimum allowed thickness. Second, if they were torqued improperly or with
some junk between the rotor and the spindle they could potato(e) chip on you.

Just some thoughts...
