Does the 89 928S4 have this system?

I posted that this weekend my car came up with this message 
on the 'information management system' and that said message
isn't mentioned in the documentation that I have for the car.
One person responded directly that this may have something to do with 
a tire pressure monitoring system. 

Does anyone know if the 89's have the dreaded tire pressure monitoring
system? I was hoping not to have this feature.

the 'Prufen?' message stayed continuously displayed for about 3 hours while 
the car was parked in the driveway. When I got ready to put it away
the car restarted, the message departed, and I'm still puzzled.

Having been stranded on more than a few occasions by our 
previous hydrophbic 928 (an 83)
I'm paranoid about 'things that might go wrong'.
Help,
Jim
and I sure would like to RTFM about this 'Sensoren - Prufen?' thingy.
Anybody know where/if this might be documented?
