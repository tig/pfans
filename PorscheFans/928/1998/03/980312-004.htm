Someone was on 911 list was cool enough to post this: 

As a followup to recent questions about care of Fuchs wheels (David
McLaughlin) and paint/interior surfaces (Vic) , I have found the series
of car care articles I mentioned the other day.  They are on the
Sacramento Valley PCA site, in the technical section (address:
www.DerPorsche.net; add /tech.htm for technical page).  The articles
listed are:

Car Care Articles from Larry Reynolds

     Clean EngineAnd Culinary Delights
     The Care &; Feeding of Vinyl/Leather
     Taking Care of Cabrio Tops
     Cleaning Your Paint Part 1.
     Cleaning Your Paint Part 2.
     Cleaning Your Paint Part 3.
     How to clean a neglected car
     Cleaning Porsche Wheels
     Protect Your Porsche On The Track And Autocross
     Repairing Porsche Wheels
     Washing Your Porsche
     Covers For Your Porsches or other car
     Paint Chip Repair
     Got Squealing Brakes?

I found these to be very informative and educational regarding the wide
variety of products available.  Larry Reynolds also makes clear his
favorite products and his reasons for these preferences.
