Well, here is the "bastard" solution to your most of your problem.
Replace the nylonhoses with rubber tube you can find at any automotive
store.  I also found a nylon
5 way splitter at autozone for <$2.  A couple of 3 way were available
for the same price.
Tubing price was about $0.40/foot so I have replace almost all the hoses
for less then
$10.

HERE IS WHY I DID I THIS WAY.

My car came with 2 4 way splitter from the factory NOT THE 5 or 7 way
splitter described
in the parts fiche.  The 4 way splitter are no longer available (someone
told me they never were,
the 4 way were a factory short cut...).   To replace 2 4 way splitter
with 3 way splitters becomes
very expensive (over $3 each) and you have to add about 20 little rubber
bends at $2 each and
then add nylon tubing at ~$1/foot (I have bought the same tubing for
<$0.10/foot from McMaster
Carr).  I also think that doing it this way is not ideal.  It creates
many places for leaks due to all
the connectors used.  By using rubber hose, I only have 2 or 3
interconnections making the system,
in my opinion, much more reliable.

It sadden me that Porsche does not reduce the price of the basic
maintenance stuff.  These parts
could easily be discounted and it would increase the chance of people
taking better care of
their car.  if you told someone that they should R&R their vacuum system
and it will cost
$50 or more in parts plus labor, they might not do it (especially on a
car you can pick up for <$8000).
If you tell them that you can do it for $10 (or even less) in part, it
might get done.

Before people flame me too bad, I did pay $20 for the 3" hose that goes
from the breather box to the
control valve to the air pump (even though the other one was still
marginally OK).  But you must
admit that the price is far fetch...
