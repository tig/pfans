Back of the car...next to the fuel tank.  Lying under the car, you
should see two nuts holding on the fuel pump/filter cover, roughly 6
inches back from the bumper cover.  Undo those, and the cover, with some
wiggling, will drop away.  You'll then see everything laid out right in
front of you.  

it's a very easy job, but you ARE going to get gasoline all over you,
Murphy will see to that.
