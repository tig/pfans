    In regards to the resent questions about both oil additives and K & N
filters there is a veritable gold mine of information available at the Toyota
MR2 web site concerning both these subjects and many other interesting topics.
The main web site can be reached at:  www.mr2.com

For the oil additive article go to:  www.mr2.com/TEXT/snake_oil.txt
For the K & N filter article go to:  www.mr2.com/TEXT/kn_filter.txt

P.S.   There are also other very interesting articles on batteries, oil
filters, etc.,  all                            
          are very well researched.  
 
   My one area of disagreement with the oil article is,   I DO NOT believe
that         
synthetic oil is over kill, or a luxury item.  There are very real reasons to
use this latest technological improvement in oils, like the ability to handle
extreme temperatures without thinning, coking, or turning into glue.  I have
been in frozen ski areas where I was the only peson in a resort parking lot,
of several hundred cars, who was able to start their car without a engine
heater, and living in Florida when I was using regular 20-50w oil in my 928,
if  I got stuck in a traffic jam during the summer, it was common to see the
oil pressure begin to drop, as the oil thinned, until the point the low oil
pressure warning light would begin to flicker at idle, VERY SCARY.  
   Now with Mobile 1, I can sit all day if I have to and the oil pressure
needle hardly  moves, so no one will ever convince me that synthectic oil is
not worth every dollar in my engine.  I used to pay almost double the money
they charge now, and had to drive to a oil wholesale firm that specialized in
aircraft oil and by it by the case, you should have seen that oil bill.  So
when I buy it in a automotive store now for  3 to 4 dollars I feel lucky it is
this cheap.    
     One side note, Mobil 1 recently took a BMW  325 off of their test bed
after 1 million simulated miles, and tore down the engine.  They showed the
engine parts, and measured them, all were within new part tolerances, with
virtually no wear.  
In case anyone is wondering, No I do not work for Mobil or any other
petrochemical firm.
