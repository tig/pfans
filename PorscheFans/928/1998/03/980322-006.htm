Philip,

Its' been so long since I lived in Germany that at this point the only
expressions I've retained are such basics as "Vo is der bahnhoff bitte, and
Hey Schaatz, cominzee hier. etc. serious scientific things like that, or if
you're from Phil Tong's home state, "Lidat".  There are others, but none
that I'd use in this forum.  Hope all is well down under.  Hadn't spoken to
you for a while as I suffered a disastrous computer crash which put me off
line for almost a month and was due to my clever time saving ploy of not
bothering to back up my work for a long time.
