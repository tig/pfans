Hi All

I carried out the bypass on the RDK control unit to disable the tire
pressure warning system a few weeks ago on my 1990 S4 - I have the 17 inch
cup wheels fitted.
It is now great that the main display does not flash the warning for lost
pressure every 15 minutes, but the small red light with the axle symbol on
it in the top right of the instrument binnacle is still stuck on. It had
been suggested on this list that the 'memory' had to be cleared by driving
the car for more than 8 occasions or disconnecting the battery. I have tried
both these without success
( I disconnected the battery for 2 days!).
In the manual it says the car has to travel 20 meters to activate the tire
pressure warning system and I found this did happen for the warning on the
main display, but this small red light illuminates about 2 seconds after the
engine has been started even if the car is stationery!
For now I have placed some black tape on the Perspex to cover the light, but
ideally would like to make the job complete by extinguishing the light.
Can someone please help?
