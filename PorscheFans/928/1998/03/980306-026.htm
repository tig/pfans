Dear 928 fans.

I have been looking for a 928S2 in the UK, and have looked at 5 now.

The most recent which I was pretty keen on, was an August 85, 4 speed =
Auto, with Prussian blue paintwork, blue leather interior, and a =
reconditioned gearbox, but during the test drive there was a clonking =
noise coming from the rear left corner.

I wonder if anyone can make any suggestions as to what the noise could =
be. Initially I thought it sounded like a loose spare wheel rattling in =
the boot or the tailgate rattling. The dealer selling the car suggested =
it could be a shock absorber or the exhaust pipe rattling.

Has anyone got any other ideas, what is the most serious problem I =
should be considering?

When listening closely to the engine, I could here quite a bit of tappet =
noise, which I haven't noticed before on a 928, I have the impression =
that the car had been standing for a few weeks.

Any suggestions as to why the tappets should be noisy?=20
e.g. Lack of oil pressure, blocked oil ways in need of flushing.

I am dying to get my hands on a 928 soon.

Regards

Nigel Hooker,
