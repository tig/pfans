I don't know anything about K40's but I know some of the new radar detectors have radar detector detector blockers. I forget exactly how it works. One company, don't remember which one, blocks the cops detector detector. Another one
turns off when it detects a detector detector.

Just make it easy to pull out and if you get busted, take it out for them. No damage, no problem.

I have an old POS detector. I'd be willing to trade. The only speeding ticket I've gotten was in Virginia where detectors are illegal. Stupid me, I put the thing in the glove compartment to obey the law.
