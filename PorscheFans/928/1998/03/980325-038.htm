<<The red 1987 S4 many of us have been watching lately on television,
the
stock US-spec car that Al Holbert used to set the 170+ mph flying mile
and
flying kilometer records at Bonneville in 1986, became a track safety
car
for all the reasons you stated. It was repainted white and wore a light
bar. It's not beyond possibility that it's become red again, and that
it's
the car you're discussing.>>

I wasn't going to post about this particular subject, but now my
interest is piqued.  The way I read the statement is that Leonard wrote
that the car was re-painted white AFTER the top speed run.  Well,
everyone who has a copy of the 87 928 Porsche tape take a look at it. 
Specifically the part after the record setting run where Al H. gets out
of the car.  The inside of the doors are WHITE.  It isn't from the salt
either.  Maybe the car began life white and was repainted multiple
times.  What do you think?
