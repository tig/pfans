I KNOW THERE IS SOMEONE OUT THERE BY THE NAME OF PATRICK
[I THINK THAT IS THE CORRECT NAME] WHO HAS REPLACED THE ORIGINAL 
928 ENGINE WITH A CHEVY. WOULD YOU PLEASE WRITE TO ME I NEED TO
KNOW IF YOU USED THE KIT FROM RENEGADE HYBRIDS OUT OF CALIFORNIA, ALSO HOW
DOES IT DRIVE, ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE INSTALLATION IS IT AS EASY AS THEY CLAIM
ON THEIR WEB PAGE?
DO ALL THE ACCESORIES FALL INTO PLACE, ECT. PLEASE WRITE BACK.
BY THE WAY A FEW WEEKS AGO I POSTED THAT TWICE I BUSTED THE ENGINE IN MY 86
928, BOTH TIMES THIS WAS CAUSED BY A FAULTY, LEAKING WATERPUMP, RESULTING IN
THE PUMP CEASING, FREEZING AN FRYING , DESINTEGRATING THE TIMING BELT. I LOVE
THIS CAR, BUT I AM TIRED OF FIXING THE ENGINE. MY ADVISE FOR ANYONE OUT THERE 
IF YOU SEE WATER LEAKING OUT GET IT FIXED ASAP..
