....so anything anyone here tells you about radar detector is strictly
academic. No one here is encouraging you to buy or use one. What you
actually do is your business. Clear?

Don't fool with the existing warning lights; there's a MUCH better way. A
certain S4 I know well has a K40 detector, whose control panel is mounted
in the recess where the ashtray used to be (in-car smokers need not apply).

The flip-up lid is in place and normally down, so nothing is visible, but
the chirp signal is easily audible (at least with the radio not blasting).
Flip up the lid and you see the entire K40 panel (it's pretty small), with
sensitivity and volume switches and indicator light, with enough room left
below it to hold a standard garage door opener remote.

The detector's (featureless black matter) sensor is mounted under the fin
in the air intake up front, where it gets a nice view forward. A
rear-facing sensor could be mounted inside the rear bumper cover behind the
tool kit.

Neat, eh?
