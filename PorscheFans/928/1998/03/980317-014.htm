 No question about it, it will make noticeable difference.  What *I* 
would do (and have done several times) is just have any exhaust shop 
fashion a 'Y' pipe using the flanges already connected to the manifolds.  
Use 2" pipe to keep velocity up, and make the 'Y' not too sharp:

For single pipe exhausts,

 For duals, it is easier--just cut out the cat and replace w/straight 
pipes.

You'll end up with a throat-ier sound, but most everyone likes it much 
better than stock.
