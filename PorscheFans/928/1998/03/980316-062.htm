I was at the shop today getting the oil changed in the shark, and
was able to loose the service manager and spend about an hour with 
their mechanic.  (I would love to have a lift at my house!)
Funny, the mechanics job is to fix the car, and the service mangers
job is to squeeze the customers wallet - their respective enthusiasms
were quite obvious to me today!
He went over all the various points of interest, and we found among
other things, 4 points of engine oil leakage.  It's not serious,
In 3000 miles, the total consumption/leakage drops to "half" on the
dip-stick level marks.  But, the bottom of the motor and surrounding
area is wet with oil.

As I listened to the book assesment of how much time to replace 
this and that, he offered a suggestion.  He said that it takes
13 hours to pull and replace the motor, and while it's out 
and accessable, I could replace every gasket and seal for a very
minimal ammount of time.  I have 2 valve cover leaks, some minor
leakage on the rear seal, and a pan gasket that looks like it's 
about to squeeze out.  

1) Has anyone ever done this or entertained the thought of doing it?

2) If I were to have the motor pulled, what else could/should be
   replaced?

3) What gaskets and seals are there that COULD be changed if the
   motor was pulled without major motor dissassembly?

4) With the motor out, what other major engine work could be done
   to an 83k motor in good working order?
   
The PO had the timing belt done about 8k ago and todays inspection
showed it to be in good shape although he couldn't check the tension
because the motor was still hot from the drive over.  Timing belt 
and water pump anyway???

Any suggestions, please let me know!
