	Rear detection?  Why?

	I've never understood the purpose of detecting radar from behind, as it =
is impossible to be clocked from behind or laterally using radar.
	Radar works on the Dopler shift principle, which is a measurment of =
change in frequency of microwaves reflected off of a moving target.
	However; if the radar waves and the target vehicle are moving in the =
same direction, there is a phonomenon known as Cosine Error that =
prevents an acurate reading of the relative speed of target from being =
calculated. Pretty much the same when trying to clock a target moving =
perpedicularly to radar emissions.
	Therefore, the only concern for low flying Shark drivers is from radar =
jockeys whom you are APPROACHING, not moving away from.

	Just some college Physics I remember, plus the fact that I've never =
heard of anyone being clocked from behind by RADAR. (All bets are off on =
Laser though. This stuff works on different physical principles)

	As far as being paced by a stealthy Law Mans cruiser; well, better =
start memorizing the headlight configurations of Crown Vics and Chevy =
Impalas.

	My two cents on the matter.
