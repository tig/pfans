Well everyone.  I just BCC'ed about 200 people this notice so you wouldn't
have to scroll through all the names.

When I received this I called AT&T to see if this was true before just
sending it on & possible wasting every ones time.  (You know, like the
e-mail hoax bullsh*t that people pass on saying that you'll get a virus).

Well this one is true.  So read this & pass it on & thanks to who passed it
onto me.

-------------------------

FYI -- This note is being past around -- just in case you haven't seen it....

I received a telephone call from an individual identifying himself as an AT&T
Service Technician that was running a test on our telephone lines.  He stated
that to complete the test I should touch nine (9), zero (0),pound sign (#)
and hang up.  Luckily, I was suspicious and refused. Upon contacting the
telephone company we were informed that by pushing 90# you end up giving
the individual that called you access to your telephone line and allows
them to place a long distance telephone call, with the charge appearing on
your
telephone bill.  We were further informed that this scam has been originating
from many of the local jails/prisons.  Please "pass the word".
