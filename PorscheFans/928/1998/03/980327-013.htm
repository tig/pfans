Ed,

With the exception of the engine oil (should be changed regularly) all of the
things you are planning to change should be done about once a year anyway and
it is always good to do it before a track event.  Be sure that you have enough
brake pad and rotor left and you should be good.  Once you get this stuff done
for this event you should be good for the rest of the year.

I did all the things you mentioned before my first track event and then did
nothing else for the next 5 events that year.  Pretty nice to just drive your
car out to the track, shoe polish some numbers on it and go driving!!  I love
these cars.

The potential for speed in a 928 always surprises the 911 guys.  They have
been mislead to believe that they are slow and ponderous cars when that is NOT
the reality.

Cheers, and have fun...updated us after the event.
