I have leather sport seats that are looking rather worn.  Can anyone
tell
me the process for dyeing these and where I might get the materials to
do the job?

Kevin, Larry Reynolds of Car Care Specialties 201-796-8300 sells the
Color Plus system, including dye, spackling material for cracks called
Flex Fill, and Soffener for brittle spots.  I sent him my sunvisor so
they could match the color perfectly.  I bought an airbrush for about
$20 at a hobby shop and used an inflated tire for propellant (much
cheaper than cans of propellant).  Also I had much of my interior
removed.  Larry has supplemental instructions that are better than the
Color Plus instructions.  For example CP says completely strip off the
old finish with laquer thinner and then sand.  I found this to be
unnessssary and much too harsh on any frail/brilttle spots.  Larry
points out if it's just cleaned and dry the color will take to the
leather just fine.

David Roberts pointed out to me that a line of refininshing products
called SEM that is cheaper and is probably more durable.  This is an
option if you have a color like black that doesn't require a custom
color match.  Feel free to e mail me for pointers.
