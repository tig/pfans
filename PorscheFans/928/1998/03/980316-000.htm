To  all  928  fans  and  owners,  I am  glad  I  found  this  web  site.
Currently  hunting  for  a  1986  928s  myself,  I  have  been  down  loading
the  928  e mail 
for  some  time  now,  great  bunch  of  people  who  own  these  magnificent
automoblies,  and  very  knowledgable  also  on  all  aspects  of  the  car.
I  currently  have  two  928s  that  I  have  my  eye  on  one  red  and  one
black. I  have  test  driven  the  black  one. WHAT  A  SOLID  MACHINE!  I
have  one  question  for  anyone  out  there.  The  owner  said  he  replaced
the  brake  pads  recently , but  when  I  drove  it  the  ABS  light  was  on
durring  the  test  drive  he  said  it  was  the  ABS  sensor  and  it  would
cost  about  $800.00  to  get  repaired  is  that  true  or  should  I be
concerned? Other  than  that  there  was  nothing  really  wrong  with  the
car  that  I could  tell.  I  consider  myself  pretty  mechanically  incline
due  to  my  years  as  a  U.S.A.F  jet  engine  technician. I  also  work  on
my  own  car  which  is  a  SAAB  9000  TURBO  not  a  bad  little four
banger.  Nothing  compared  to  the  928.  If  any  one  can  respond  to
this  letter  it  would  be  greatly  appreciated.  From  my  readings  of
the  letters  I see that  Mr  Phil  Tong  seems  to  be  quite  the  expert
on  these  fine  cars,  If  you  could  respond  to  the  question  your
response  will  weigh  heavilly  upon  purchase  of  that  one  car.

thank  you

P.S.  Phil  I  found  your  928svr  website,  great  site!
