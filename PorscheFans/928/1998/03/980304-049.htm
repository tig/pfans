....until they rupture or break, at which point you have no brakes (at least
in that part of the circuit). The message John forwarded reports several
cases of exactly that. This is why the SS lines generally available are not
DOT approved.

As with trick wheels, hyper engine mods, and various other edge moves made
to get the last bit of performance in competition, these things work if
they're not subjected to inclement weather, inspected VERY frequently, and
maintained or changed pretty often. Even with all these caveats, there are
reports (not limited to John's forwarding) of apparently spontaneous failures.

Well, for anyone about whom this in doubt: what do you see when you open
your eyes?
