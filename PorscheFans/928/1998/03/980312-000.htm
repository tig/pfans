I have an 83' and has seen pics of early cars with the s4 wing added just
above the s spoiler and also with the s' spoiler removed.  My question is
that after removing the "fin" on my 83' how much body work will need to be
done to patch up holes or ETC.  I'd like to stick and s4 spoiler on the car
for a little newer look, but I think that leaving the older spoiler might
look like too much is going on back there.  I've only seen pictures of cars
that have done this, so if anyone has done this or has seen cars with it
done either way I would appreciate your thoughts.   I know everyone has
different taste though, but it's obvious that we all have good taste. WE
