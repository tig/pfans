In reply to post on 27th Feb from Jim Stadter:

Upper and lower control arms should never need to be replaced .......

There is a third reason for change.

My 86 S2 has worn bushings on the upper control arms. Porsche and =

 others tell me the only way to replace
these is complete change of the units - not a cheap option at nearly =

 =9C1000 for the pair.
My Porsce dealer told me this was a know problem with 944's and 928's - =

 nice little earner if it's true.

I'm not sure what their reasoning is (someone told me the bushings are =

 moulded on and so not replacable),
but I've seen firms advertising refurbished arms, which leads me to =

 believe that this may not be the case.

Can anyone tell me different, and if so does anyone know the dimentions =

 of the bushings or where I can get any
info/diagrams (apart from the service manual which I don't own).

I'm not really happy at paying this price for replacement (although I =

 may not have any choise in the long run), so
any help/info/commiserations gratefully recieved
