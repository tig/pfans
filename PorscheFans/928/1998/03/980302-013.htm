Thought I'd make my first post to the list a joke....

There is this mexican guy going from house to house in Beverly Hills,
looking for work.   He approaches this mansion, knocks and a fellow
comes to the door...so he ask "Do You have any work I can do?". =20
The fellow thinks for a minute..then says "I was going to paint my
porch in back, So I can let you do that."     The Mexican goes in back,
gets the paint and starts painting... in about 20 or 30 minutes he is
back knocking on the front door..Saying he's finished.    The fellow
says" WOW, you are fast that is a big porch."   The Mexican says
"I gotta tell you somthing.  That's no Porche, it's a Jaguar!!"

Don Carter 86 928S (never can remember what the color is called,
metalic charcoal maybe?)
Houston, TX

PS.  Anybody ever had any sucess at fixing the cruise control?  I've
been on a fixing spree and that's the last thing that doesn't work.
