Hi all!

I need some advice for my latest challenge on the beast...  I had a/c
repair done several months ago and during that process the mechanic cracked
my reservoir tank while putting it back in. 

Well, these things happen, so I replaced it.  Ever since, I've had a
*small* coolant leak that I can't track down.  I have no idea if it's
related to this a/c work or if it's a separate problem.  I've looked high
and low, but simply can't find any evidence of leaking.

The symptoms are:  a quick smell of hot coolant once in awhile when I pull
up at a stop light, and once a week or so the reservoir is empty when I go
out to the car to start up.

Some of you in the past have complained about hard to find leaks, and I'm
hoping that you may be able to steer me in the right direction.
