Phil, I have pictures of my car in the corkscrew at Laguna Seca (close up=
 )
on the 245 50s in the rear,
No tire roll and good traction for a street set up.  Not much difference
even going to the 17x9s with RE71s 255x40s.
Because of the reasons listed in an earlier post.  The big difference cam=
e
from the switch to the A0032Rs.
I liked them.  Not quite as sticky as the R1s but still very good for the=

928.  I think the problem with the mazda and bmw m5 owner with the yokies=

was because they were a bmw and a mazda 626 and not a 928.
The 928 and its unique suspension  and wieght distribution is able to kee=
p
the tires flat on the ground in all driving attitudes.  the BMW 5s and
mazdas, well, you know.    (you need the r1s to make up for the schlocky
suspension and 500lbs of excess wieght misdistributed in the M5)
.
