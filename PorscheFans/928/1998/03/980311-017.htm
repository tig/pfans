Reverend Crosby,

Thank you for your uplifting inspirational sermon on the proper venues to
safely demonstrate our driving skills.  Just yesterday I safely
demonstrated one of mine by making a sudden high speed move down an I-95
off ramp thereby leaving the poor soul in the NSX I had been racing with to
bear the full brunt of the pursuing trooper's rage at not being able to
nail both of us. It seemed like the reasonable, prudent, mature thing to do
at the time.


There is however, a slight chance that your message was misdirected.  Were
you possibly trying the reach Trabantfans@AARP.pablum.shuffleboard.com?
The members of this group own 928s for many reasons; one of them being the
fact that they're amongst the fastest cars in the world.  All things
considered, I believe that most of them are probably pretty good drivers
who don't really need a course in basic highway safety or behavior.  In
spite of that, I also believe that the combined weight of their right feet
could most likely capsize the QE-II. 

I no longer race on tracts.  Now I just read them.  By the way, do you get
out of the shower to take a leak?  Have you ever read "Tom Swift and his
Giant Searchlight"?  Just kidding of course, although in truth, many years
ago I did safely demonstrate my flying skills by flying a Stearman upside
down under all three bridges and the high tension wires that span the Cape
Cod Canal, in formation with two other cautious, thoughtful seventeen year
olds.  We followed that up immediately by dive bombing our High School
football game with water filled condoms.  The mission was a complete
success.  We managed to get not only the Principal, but also the
Superintendent of Schools with the same Trojan.

Naturally, the CAP Commander, School Authorities, and our parents, all
being jealous of our safe flying skills, ganged up on us, and in an
unbelievable display of narrow minded petulance and ignorance, suspended us
for two weeks, which we were forced to spend fishing and drinking beer.
Lets face it, you can take these demonstrations of safe driving and flying
skills too far.  They're hardly ever appreciated by the proles.

Gene O'Rourke

One and a quarter million accident free miles demonstrating my safe driving
skills, almost a third of that in various Porsches, and occasionally at
speeds that would cause Michael Schumacher to blanch and lose control of
his sphincter muscle.
