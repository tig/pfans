<<I've noticed several inquiries lately as to the value of various
928's. 
Following is the URL for the Kelley Blue Book website.  It gives a fair
ballpark value of all used vehicles based on condition, options and
where in
the country the car is located.  The dollar values for "Buy a Used Car"
and
"Sell a Used Car" are often quite varied - explanations are included.>>

This is a subject dear to my heart, because I always have some customers
who will come to me saying "well, I looked it up in the Kelley Blue Book
and they said the car is only worth X."  The only problems is that these
people have no idea how KBB comes up with their numbers.  Auctions? 
Dealers?  I bet no one here knows either.  The KBB and other price
guides are not gosphel.  Some of their prices are way off from market
values, esp for Porsche and other high end autos.  (For example, I was
working a deal on a 1990 928 GT with 29K miles.  KBB said it was worth
$26,000.  The car sold for $30,500 to a guy in TX who NEVER SAW IT. 
Why?  How many GT's with low miles are on the market?  Not many.  So if
you want it, you pay.)  I tend to go more by what I see cars being
bought and sold for by dealers and wholesalers, along with the prices I
can get cars for.  As most on the list know the cars I have are almost
always (depending on rarity) well below fair market value.  My point is
use KBB, etc., as a reference, not as the end all be all.  KBB can spout
prices, but they can't GET you a car.
