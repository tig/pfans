Hi Tom,
How's the project coming? I'm still waiting for parts myself.
I called Europroducts today and ordered the last Light Grey 4 piece set for my
car. These are the embroidered crest Lloyd mats.....
I have the light grey seats and carpet with the navy blue dash and headliner
etc........and I already have the Lloyd embroidered crest mats in navy blue
currently, but thought I'd better get these while they're still
available......I got the navy blue before, because I thought they wouldn't
show dirt so bad, then when I got them, they were so nice that I bought clear
plastic mats to go over them so that I wouldn't ruin them. So now I'll have
two cherry sets.......That's it though.....not spending anymore money on my
car till I get new wheels / tires!
Oh, question......were you able to put on pan gasket without removing the
steering rack? 

Best Regards,
Greg Schickel
