Actually, Michigan does make a hell of a lot of money with RADAR & LIDAR.
But NOT with the Same Lane units.  To my knowledge they don't use them here
in Michigan.  I've heard of them in use out west but don't know where else.
And yes, you bet your *ss that I would fight one of those tickets received
with S-L RADAR.  That's probably why they're not to popular.  Now
unfortunately for us Michigan residents or Mich travelers, the MSP (Mich
State Police) as well as county & city boys are some of the best trained
RADAR officers in the nation.  In other words the chances of getting out of
a RADAR ticket in Mich is slim.  They usually have all of their ducks in a
row when they go to court.

I can't say I feel "safer" with a detector, but I *can't* count the number
of times I've been saved by mine.  I just make sure I'm not the one out
front, or like you said speed very little at night unless someone ahead of
me is stupid enough to be my "bear bait".  Then I follow about 1/8 of a
mile behind & that has saved me many of times.

The big benefit with a detector (even with instant on) is that you are
hoping for a warning from the officer checking someone else way in front of
you.  That's when you get a chance to slow down.

As a matter of fact, I don't even have a Radar detector anymore.

I don't know, but I would bet that it is much more likely to beat a "same
lane" ticket in court. Based on your explanation it would appear that an
accurate reading is that much more difficult to obtain. Especially since
the officer must make "JUDGEMENTS" that factor heavily in the accuracy of
the radar unit's reading.
>	I thought getting rid of human error was the purpose of moving to
automated detection devices in the first place. Now your telling me that I
have the opportunity to dispute a ticket again, based on operator error? In
this case I would never pay a "same lane" ticket without fighting it.

one hand the number of times it actualy saved me from a ticket. Of course
back then PASSPORTS were not affordable to the average college student, and
Valentine didn't exist, but with the advent of "Instant On" Radar, my
confidence in Radar detectors basicly wanned anyway. I got hit twice, on
two different occasions in Mississippi by a crafty Instant On operator, and
neither time did my DECENT detector save me from a ticket. Since then I've
just slowed down (Yeah, right!!)
