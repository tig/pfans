Paul:
I'm not sure that you understand what I'm saying about the freeway grooving.  CA
has for many years now selectively put longitudinal micro grooves in the freeway
concrete to aid in traction and dispersal of moisture.  With some tires you notice
little or nothing and with others you hear a lot of tread noise.  Even if you had
the same treads on both cars, the rear track difference could account for the
noise you hear  Ask your tire shop what they think.
