Very often starter failure is only a small componant of the starter
called the clutch.  This clutch is a one way mechanism that allows the
gear on the starter to apply torque in the start direction, while
allowing the gear to slip on the shaft when the engine revs up before
the starter gear is retracted. Symptoms of this clutch failure usually
start with the sound like the starter motor is free spinning when the
key is placed in the start position, followed by a grinding noise when
the key is released. As this progresses, the grinding noise may appear
as the key is placed in the start position. Often, the clutch will
work after several tries, and the motor will turn over.

I mention this because a good auto electrical rebuild shop may have
the clutch for your starter and this item is far less costly than the
whole starter.  If this sounds like it could be your problem, Let your
fingers do the walking and ask the shop if they have a clutch. If you
are inclined to remove the starter yourself, the clutch can be checked
by checking the one way action.  Do not be fooled by the fact that the
gear turns more easily in one direction than the other.  The gear
should turn easily in one direction, but not at all in the other. 
This test is best done by the shop.
