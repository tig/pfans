Man, that's a beautiful story.  When it's right, it's right and all is
fine with the world.  We *will* look back to these days and say to each

Ok, off to the garage, last minute call from Jim it's LPR AX time at
Candlestick tomorrow (Sat. March 7), there is absolutely no rain in
sight, and given my general grumpy hairtrigger what are you dissin' the
928 for mood all over various NGs & the internet in general, IT'S TIME
TO PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL!  Turn a wheel in anger and all that red
mist stuff.  Sorry pkal - I just gotta' go!!! THWWWAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!

Hope to see Jim Murphy, Alan Ng, maybe Bob Fooshee too!?!  

Back later!
