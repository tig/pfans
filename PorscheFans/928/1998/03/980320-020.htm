	Placing dollar values on works of art like 928s is difficult at best.
	Two months ago I bought an 86 928S  auto with 125K miles. The body and
	interior are in great shape (full leather interior including dash),
	recently rebuilt tranny, engine runs really strong (also chipped) and
	completely dry underneath. the major flaw was the air conditioning
	doesn't work, and at 35K miles since the last timing belt change I
	thought it prudent to change it right away, along with the water pump.
	The price $6,500.

	Great deal!  I'm beginning to see a trend on 928 prices, it is going up.  I
foresee that we won't be seeing these kind of bargain for long!  The picking is getting
kinda slim.  This is the time to buy!!!
