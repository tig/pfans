I've noticed that whenever a car maker comes out with a new iteration  
( as the 928 was supposed to be relative to the 911) that almost
invariably the new version is somewhat underpowered. As Exibit "A", I
offer the new 996 - Porsche has left themselves a lot of room for
improved performance developments in coming years. I'm guessing that the
mfr. figures the "newness", i.e. styling updates, etc. will draw initial
buyers. Then, according to my uncorroberated theory, the popularity of
the new model is sustained by the mfr's ability to increase power and
related components, as sales warrant. I'd say BMW's rapid development of
its Z-potato car will push Porsche to power up the Boxster ASAP.

I suspect Porsche found itself in a sort of "no-man's-land" when not
only were the 928's initial sales volumes not up to expectations, but,
lo and behold, the 911's demise turned out to be just a tad premature.
All their collective foot-dragging relative to its "market
identification", and development, probably contributed greatly to the
generally underappreciated status 928's have suffered. Until WE got our
hot little hands on them, that is!
