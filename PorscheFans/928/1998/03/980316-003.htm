I just KNEW that there MUST be people of the female persuasion who like 928s
in the world.  I should have KNOWN that she would be hidden by a traitor in
our midst!

OK, Phil, where have you been hiding Melanie?

Ohmyohmyohmy!  A beautiful Deutsche fraulein sharker!

We MUST hear from her on this list.  (Probably make it a more civilized
place, too.)

On another subject, there was an ad in Uncle Henry's...the local sell and
swap weekly...for a 1960 Porsche roadster.  60,000 miles with the comment
that it had been stored for 15 years.  The ad said that it could be restored
and the sheet metal for that restoration was included.  Price:  $229.(!!).

Naturally, I had to call.  The guy who answered said that it was a Normal,
and that the price in the ad was wrong (which I assumed).  He's asking $22,900.

Well, Spring IS coming.  But THAT guy is yet another example of what happens
to people brains during a Looooooooong Maine winter!

He said he might be interested in the bridge in New York that I told him I
had for sale.........

(I thought Spring was coming.  Then we got five inches of snow Saturday
night.  My 928 is sulking!)
