Hi Farzaan:

Got it - no misunderstanding from the beginning either...

I understand your advice to keep car stock for a period, concentrating
on improving driver skills.  I have just started to learn performance
driving with this car and it's limits are definately beyond mine in most
situations, so I have a ways to go.

I also don't want to frustrate myself (or go into poor house chasing
parts) so might try some used AX tires in stock sizes.  Not that D40's
are no good - they are fine for street driving, relatively affordable
for most, not too noisy IMO.  Just not very sticky, especially since
these are new and have thick treads ;)  Great for rain which I'm glad
we're getting a break from!

Anyone have a street project that needs new tires?
