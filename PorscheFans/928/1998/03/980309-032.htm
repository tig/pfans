John:

The only wheel loss I've experienced was on one of the race cars, where a
set of lug nuts was not torqued to spec.  This was a human error, compounded
by fudging on the checklist.  You just can't be too careful.  Fortunately no
injury and just minor mechanical damage-- mostly to an expensive magnesium
wheel and a suspension upright.

Interesting to note the factory recommendation on the lubrication.  Nowhere
else have I seen a reference,  but this is obviously genuine down to
spec'ing the moly grease to use.  I've been wrong a lot this year...

The galvanic corrosion issue is only between the dissimilar metals-- steel
stud vs. aluminum nuts.  This manifests itself as a light grey aluminum
oxide powder from the threads.  If you leave the nuts in place, the oxide
will 'swell' in the threads making removal just a little more difficult.  If
you remove the nuts regularly, the sacrificial protective oxide layer is
removed each time, and a bit more aluminum is converted to to oxide next
cycle.  The nuts are anodized black, so the surface is protected initially,
but even new nuts don't seem to have the protection down into the threads.
My wheel nuts have never had this problem, BTW, thanks to relatively dry
climate here in California's coastal desert.

The spherical face seems to hold up pretty well when torqued dry against the
wheel cup, with very minor if any galling or scoring.  I have to guess the
alloy is pretty tough to be compatible with the forged wheel centers.  My
torque wrench doesn't spin fast enough to make galling a real problem.  I do
agree that proper care includes religious use of that same torque wrench so
that there is no wheel movement against the nuts.


Anyway, thanks for pointing out the error in my observation.  I'll probably
continue to install wheel nuts dry, in spite of the factory recommendation.
Maybe if I can bring myself to retorque the nuts when I check the inflation
every week,  I can feel more comfortable using a spit of grease on the nut
face.  Until then,  I'll be living in sin...
