Here's one list of what to use:

Sonax Wash (nine bucks), McGuires wash if you wanna save money (three
bucks)
McGuire's Swirl Remover (only if paint is not super slick)
3M Imperial Hand Glaze
Blitz or P21S wax
Color Plus Leather Soffner for any brittle leather, Lexol for regular
maintainance

Frequency of application depends on if car is garaged or not and how
often exposed to elements (mine never is).  

>(snip) Yes it requires some sweat and elbow grease to do all of the
>above, but aren't our Porsches worth it? 

(You may already know but) you'll notice it takes far less effort if you
do small areas at a time and be sure to remove polish/wax before it
drys.  Never wash, polish or wax in direct sun.  Rinse wash mit
frequently as it turns to sandpaper as it picks up dirt.  

We had a concours school here in Atlanta and the teacher recommended
Ivory liquid and vegetable oil.  Dish soap is designed to attack animal
fat and in this way removes wax completely the first time.  Use premium
auto wash and only enough to break the ionostatic bond between dirt and
car (inevitably less than the instructions say).  Use a large (5 gal)
wash bucket.  I agree to never machine buff unless damage/neglect
warrants it. 

Interestingly show cars are never waxed and many are never washed, as
they don't get dirty.  McGuires makes a spray called Final Inspection if
you have a garage queen that only gets a little dust.
