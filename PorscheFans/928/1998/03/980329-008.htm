Ken...

Dave Lloyd provided some info to you on your prospective purchase of an XJS,
and I noticed he mentioned my name as an owner of both a 928 and an XJS (89
conv.).

I've been out of town and haven't been able to get me e-mail, so my response
to your query is a little late...but hope it is still useful.  If there's
anything specific you want to ask, e-mail me directly.

Years to buy - newer the better (like anything else), but quality is better
after '88 model year.  I prefer '91 or older since it is the earlier body
style with the distinctive rear lamps, rather than the nondescript rectangular
lighting from '92 up.

V12 engine - all alloy, 5.3 liter, very reliable, if it isn't accidentally
overheated.  Much better engine than XJ6 XK powerplant.  Check for any signs
of overheating such as stains at expansion tank and around cylinder heads.
Oil leaks are common around valve covers (actually cam bearing block), but a
lot of work to get at.  But otherwise, the engine consumes very little oil and
really shouldn't drip any.  Capacity is 12 quarts.  I change mine once a year
at Xmas before I put car away for winter.  I use 15W50 Mobil 1 exclusively.
My local garage does the change for $25 - I buy the oil, they provide the
filter and labor.  Engine is rated at 262 bhp, later models (6.0 liter) were
up to 301 (I believe).  Compared to my 928 (316 hp), it feels more like 225hp.
Engine performance mods (like intake/chips) can be had from England for a
reasonable price ($1500) and provide about 50 hp.

Transmission - As Dave says, it is bulletproof.  GM TH400's may not be the
most sophisticated, but they work forever, every garage mechanic can work on
them, and there are tons of performance kits for them from companies such as
B&M, etc.

Reliability - Mechanically, average.  If you keep it maintained, you should
expect reliability on par with other mainstream cars.  Suspension is critical,
since it has lots of moving parts, and still has old fashioned grease fittings
everywhere.  I've driven 25,000 mile cars with very "clunky" sounding
suspensions that I wouldn't consider buying.  Others with 50K miles that
sounded fine.  AC/heating system can be very expensive to fix - make sure it
works!  All in all, the car is mechanically more reliable than the 928, since
ancillary component failure such as steering racks, water pumps, etc. are not
nearly as universal as they are on the 928.

Reliability - Electrically, slightly less than average.  This is the weakest
aspect of the car, as you'd expect.  But reliability of '88 and newer cars is
significantly better than earlier models.  Switches here and there sometimes
require replacing, and sometimes electrical items refuse to operate one
moment, and then are fine the next time.  However, the electrical system is a
paragon of reliability in comparison with 928s.  As I've stated on this list
before, if Lucas is the Prince of Darkness, then Bosch is the King.  At least
one thing can be said of the XJS, it got better with time, whereas the 928's
weaknesses were basically left unsolved by the factory.

Reliability - Bits and Pieces, average.  Interior and cosmetic parts about
average in durability, again, much better than the 928.  You seldom find
broken pieces in an XJS, whereas 928s have their fair share (to a large extent
due to mechanics trying to remove parts without knowing how to do so).  But in
general, you'll find the quality of the interior bits and pieces to be
superior in basic design and/or marerials/fabrication in comparison with your
928.

Repair costs - Difficult to work on, esp. under the hood (bonnet), because of
all the plumbing.  However, probably not much different than the 928.  Parts
costs are significantly cheaper, and the number of knowledgeable mechanics is
much greater than for the 928.  Any Jag dealer can take care of you, whereas
we all know that not all Porsche dealers can do the same for the 928 (they can
"take" you, however).  Check out Hemmings for the sheer quantity of new and
used parts for the XJS.

Before you buy, make sure the car is quiet, esp no suspicious noises from
under the hood or from the chassis.  And try everything to make sure it works.
If it is a coupe (this it what I assume you're looking at), look carefully for
possible water leaks at the rear window.  Check the front brakes for pulsing
(rotors warp easily, but are relatively cheap to replace).  Check under the
front carpets for any signs of moisture (leaking HVAC system, but could also
be just a plugged AC condensation drain line).  $15K for a 90 coupe is high,
should be more like $10-12K, with a convertible at $7-$10K higher.  Again,
check out Hemmings to get calibrated.  One piece of advice, take your time,
ther are lots of XJS's out there - find a good one.  I looked at 20+ cars
before I bought mine.  I was able to buy mine on the spot, because after
looking at plenty of them, I knew when I had found "the one".  I don't know
what part of the country you're from, but a very good market (plenty of cars,
low prices) is St. Louis area.

By the way, HE means high efficiency, not high energy (a common mistake).  All
V12s after 1985? have the HE engine, and were badged as such on the boot lid.
But eventually this designation was dropped from the lid.  Compression with
the May head is 12.5:1, very high by any standards, and obviously requiring
high-octane fuel.  Typical highway milage is right around 20 mpg at 65-70 mph
with cruise control on.

In my four years with my '89 XJS, I've changed the oil 4 times (as described
previously), had one alignment plus new wheels/tires, one AC recharge, one
coolant hose replaced (had a split which only leaked under pressure so no
coolant on the garage floor) - that's it.

In my three years with my 87 928 - well, I'd prefer not to get into that
story, particularly the electrical gremlins.

Like any specialty car, learn as much as you can about them before you buy -
you'll be glad you did.
