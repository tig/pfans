Tom,

First, thank you for the post on the Selector lights.  My owners manual 
does not mention them, either.  But, I still want to look.  They just look 
like they should.

On another matter, could you describe the steps to remove the front wiper 
motor.  Spring rain is here and I cannot wait until I receive my official 
shop manuals.

No, not a stupid question at all.

I see from Ken Postma's post that due to MY differences your car may not
have a bulb to illuminate the shifter letters.  Here's a quickie on the
removal procedure if you want to look to make sure.

(From the shop manual, sec 37, pg 101).

1. Remove the selector lever grip and take off rubber boot.
2  Move selector lever to position "2" and push rear locking bar forward
against stop with a suitable tool (e.g. scribe). (The little metal tab
you'll see through the opening around the shift lever)
3.  Move selector lever to position "R", disconnect gate and push
forward as far as possible.
4.  Push front locking bar forward against stop with a suitable tool
(e.g. scribe).
5. Move selector lever to position "P" and press out cover frame
carefully with a suitable screwdriver applied at the left rear corner.
6. Move selector lever to position "N" and remove frame inclined toward
rear.

If you have a bulb, it's right under there on the left side (right under
where the letters are).
