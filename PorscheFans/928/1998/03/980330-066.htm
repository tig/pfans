Hi Lee,

THE EVENT

Thanks for all the information and help. With regards to the timing of the
event however this period falls within my children's school holiday. I am
divorced and get to see the kids for a month over the summer vacation
period. I don't get much chance to see them the rest of the time due to me
working in Africa, me staying in northern England when I'm back and them
living in the north of Scotland.

Do you think the event is such I could keep a girl (13) and boy (11) amused
during it?


PORSCHEFANS REGALIA

I arrange the regalia for my own club. So here are a few approximate
examples of cost from my experience:

Three colour car stickers about 2" x 3" 	1000 = 175 Pounds
					2000 = 250 Pounds

Large single colour sticker (fits all the way across width of top of rear
window of 924, 928, 944, 968 series) with PORSCHEFANS in stretched text
about 2 1/2" to 3" high in Individual letters on a single peel off backing
sheet would be about 7 pounds. No minimum number required.
Note at this location it is not seen in the rear view mirror of a 944.

Polo shirt with say PORSCHEFANS in 3/4" high letters on breast about 11
pounds each. 2 pounds extra to have your own name and car type or
registration number added to sleeve or beast. No minimum number required.

I will be in the Uk in around two weeks I can arrange anything if required.
