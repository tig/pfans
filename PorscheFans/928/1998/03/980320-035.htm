 For the last 8 years, y little secret on all my 928s has been to use a 
Volkswagon Diesel battery.  It is much lighter (25lbs!), much cheaper 
($70 less), and has always worked very well.  It has high cold-cranking 
amps (Diesel requirement), not as many "reserve minutes," but this is 
rarely an issue.
