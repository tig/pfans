Thanks! I am going to discuss the price with the seller and see if
I can reduce the price via reducing my down payment on the shark.

Thanks for aiding me in what I'm hoping to gain an Oscar in what I call
"Good Shark Hunting" !

				Happy First Day of Spring,

PS - Funny about the radio; didn't get it at first. Yeah, I thought
	it was a bit weird seeing a tube-based radio with a crystal
	thread tuner from the 30's in an '85 vehicle; I'll have to
	avoid truly bumpy roadways...     ;-)
