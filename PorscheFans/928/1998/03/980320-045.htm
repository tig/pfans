Howard,

First guess would be the vacuum controlled heater valve located inline with
the heater hose in between your engine and firewall on the passenger side
(remove complete airbox and you will see it. just behind the right head).
It is a vacuum controlled valve that controls the coolant flow into the heat
exchanger. They are renowned on both the 944s and 928s to get stuck open. If
you have a vacuum tester attach it to the valve, apply vacuum and see if it
closes the valve and holds the vacuum. If you don't have a tester look for
the little lever coming out of the valve and note the position, have someone
start you engine and move your temp slider to the coldest setting and see if
the lever moves, if it moves and holds position it is OK, if not it's bad.

If it is bad you can normally just replace the vacuum part of the valve and
that way you don't even have to take the hose loose and dump coolant
everywhere . Not a very expensive item either, last one I bought new was
under $20.
