More 2 cents on the lug nuts.

I believe the lug nuts on our 928's are aluminum. If they were not, there
would be mucho galvanic corrision going on between the lug nuts and wheels.
When the lug nuts become "frozen", there frozen to the steel studs, not the
aluminium wheels. Remember to coat those threads!!  The 911 alloy lug nuts,
which I think are the same as the 928, are aluminium and I believe are "upset
forged" to form the spherical end. 

Yes, titanium is an element. It is occasionally used pure, but it's normally
alloyed to improve certain characteristics. Titanium is usually used as a
light weight substitute for steel, not aluminium. Since titanium weighs 0.16
lb/in3, it is 60% heavier than aluminum, which weighs 0.10 lb/in3. Steel
weighs in at 0.30 lb/in3 and magnesium at 0.08 lb/in3. These densities are
approximate since they vary slightly with alloy.

In the aerospace industry, McDonnell Douglas, we use titanium where it could
be substituted for steel. It would have to be larger, since it's not as
strong. But, with it weighing slightly more than half of steel, the weight
benefit could overcome the strength issue.  For outright strength in all
directions, it's tough to beat steel at a reasonable price. Landing gears use
a steel alloy with ultimate strength values approaching 300,000 psi! Titanium
is usually less than a third of that. Also it's used in high temperature
applications such as engine exhaust cones.

Titanium can be anodized, as aluminum, to protect it from corrision.

Galvanic corrision, ultimate strength, fatigue strength, weight, material
cost, manufacturing cost, etc.,etc.,etc. All are factors when the engineers
decide what to use where.

Enough boring stuff.
