>(Still wondering why there aren't Chicks on this list.)

 The problem is that most "Chicks" have not mastered the complexity of 
pecking the keyboard, and using a mouse.  For them, studies have shown 
these interfaces to be rather inefficient.  Although, many "Chicks" have 
successfully used 'touch screens,' these still suffer from eventual 
degradation of the anti-glare coating on screen itself - the beaks are 
too high on the Moh's scale of hardness.  However, I am seeing a new 
"beak-pad" being advertised that is supposed to obviate this, and from 
the pictures it appears to be a hard-rubber cover for the tip of the 
beak. The ad also claims that "after years of unprotected "beaking," 
eventual brain-damage will occur due to the high peak g-forces applied to 
the chicken brain."  This might be hype, as anyone can see that "Chicks" 
peck anything, and most obviously, they obtain their food this way.  
Anyway, they appear to be a little expensive, but as with any new 
technology, it will eventually come down in price.
 Apparently, most mice are just too cumbersome.  I think the weight of 
the mouse approaches 150% of the "Chick's" body-weight.  Moving it 
around, even on a new mouse pad, is exhausting.  (I have heard of some 
inventive "Chicks" replacing a track-ball with a golf ball, as the 
dimples allow easier application of beak-based force.)
 So, I think, this is the reason we do not see many "Chicks" on the list; 
the bottle-neck of the computer interface itself leaves little extra time 
for "non-essential" use. (Although I would debate if the PorscheList is 
"non-essential.")

[Sorry about this truly useless post.]
