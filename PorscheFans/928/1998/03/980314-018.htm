Jim:

I totally screwed up - the computerized dash began in model year 1989.

Yes, the service manuals detail how to set language & more gory
details.  I tried to look for the sensoren message but couldn't find it.

The pressures are too high from the get go but there is a detailed
procedure to follow for that so I won't try to rehash the manual and
misquote.

*I* need to RTFM and my own webpage.
