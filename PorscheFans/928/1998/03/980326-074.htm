Tom, 

Thanks for your message. I'll check out a few sources and see if they know
what causes this problem.  In my case, the blower motor is fine, the AC
compressor was replaced last year, and the unit blows cold air.  All the
speeds work as they're supposed to until after anywhere from a few minutes
to as much as the better part of an hour, the unit just shifts into high
gear.  If I shut it off for more than a few minutes and then turn it back
on, the  process repeats.  However, if I shut it off for just a couple of
minutes and turn it back on, it comes on full blast immediately.

I wonder  if theres a bimetal strip or something similar, in the speed
control, that takes a while to resume its' natural state.   Other than
that, the obvious things to look for would be a faulty resistor or an
intermittent short, but you've pretty much eliminated the former by
replacing the resistor pack. I wonder if anyone has simply tried replacing
the speed switch?  It doesn't sound plausible to me because I imagine the
switch is a simple rotary switch with mechanical contacts.  Also, I wonder
if any of the guys on the list have contacted Porsche about it?

In the meantime, it could be a hell of a lot worse.  Here in south Florida
the AC is usually on high from April to November anyway. A much more
immediate danger is getting into the car with shorts on without screaming
in pain.  To that end I've just finally given in and installed some ugly
slip on denim seat covers.
