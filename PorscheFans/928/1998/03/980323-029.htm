>  Hello, unfortunately I have been out of this group for a month, so if
> this question has been asked forgive me.  I was driving down Hwy. 99 in
> my 87 928 S4 and all of a sudden my bottom bar on my oil pressure lights
> up.  I am thinking oh SH*t.  This doesn't look good.  I pull over to a
>  servo, and check the oil.  A quart low.  Proceed to buy oil and
> refill.  Light and ! light still blinking.  Oh Sh*t.  I limp home.  Car
> runs great, no noise oil pressure bar at 5.  But the bottom lighted bar
>  is lit with the ! warning blinking.  Oil is full.  Is there a common
> problem with these or am I in deep SH*t?  I thought that this light went
> on when there was a drop in oil pressure.  My gauge indicates at full.
>  Could my oil sensor be bad?  If so where is it and how do I check it?
> Help very very much appreciated.  Thanks.  paul
