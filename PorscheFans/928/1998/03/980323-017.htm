OK, that says that the string that feeds the servo (the outside
sensor, the inside sensor, and the slider) is connected. One
possibility that comes to mind is that the little fan that blows
air over the inside sensor is dead; it should provide just the 
slightest suction, barely detectable, to pull air over the 
sensor, so that it reads cabin temperature instead of the 
temperature inside the dash. Another possibility is that the
flaps that the servo arm controls are either maladjusted or
disconnected - if you crawl even further under the dash you
can see where the link to the servo arm goes. There's a 
procedure for adjusting it in the shop manual, which as I
recall just amounts to making sure the flaps are closed when
the arm is all the way down. If you pop the link off of the
servo arm you can feel the point at which the vents are
fully closed.
