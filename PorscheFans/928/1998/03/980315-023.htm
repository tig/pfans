Hi all,

1) Whilst taking the advice from a post, I've sprayed electrical contact
cleaner to all the fuses and relays at the fuse/relay panel. I was going to do
the same to the connectors that occupy the lower row of the panel. They are
locked into place by a plastic tang on the lower side of the connector. Does
anyone know how to release the plastic tang and remove the connector?? It
seems simply, but I don't want to force/break anything.

2) Whilst reading the latest issue of "Autoweek", there appeared an article on
the Monteverdi Hai 450SS. And I quote..."Hai sounds like "hi", and it means
"shark" in German"... Maybe a covert fellow 928 greeting could be .." Hi, Hai"
;-)

3) In the "Kempton" ad in the Feb. issue of "Panorama" (page 51) is a picture
of a 928 that is NOT for the faint of heart.
