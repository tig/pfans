We call 'em test pipes since they're only to be used at the track...

no - means the straight-through test pipe should have a bung welded on
it so you can reinstall the stock O2 sensor - must have!

Bursch is an aftermarketer.  The airpump might be specific to U.S. cars
only?  Basically it is a belt driven pump (like the a/c compressor or
such) and it pumps air into the catalyst to promote further burning of
the exhaust gas to lower emissions.  Maybe your car doesn't even have
one.  But if you do and replace the cat with the straight pipes, then
the air pump fitting isn't needed and there's no harm to just pumping to
atmosphere.  

For laughs, others have rerouted the air outlet into the intake air
snorkel.  Obviously no performance benefit there.  The real benefit is
this the owner keeps the airpump on the drive belt and running. 
Airpumps which haven't been used tend to seize up in just a few months
from non-use.  And we need to smog certify our cars every two years. At
least $150 replacement costs for the pump alone...
