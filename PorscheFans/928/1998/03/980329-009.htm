My 86 928s has had some problems that I cant figure out!

I have changed everything about 5000 miles ago, t belt water pump vac hoses
plugs, plug wires etc...

After running hard the other day I heard a little bit of pinging/ detonation ,
the car refused to idle, the car runs rough up to about 2500 rpm, but still
doesnt feel right beyond that.  It just sounds different, and a little bit
down on power.  Dies everytime when coasting down to stop.  have to run the
car in 4th gear on highway so the car doesnt buck.

My guess from the pinging would be a vac leak, but instead I would think it
would idle faster.  (There is a new idle stabilizer valve)

Bad spark plug?  they are new, besides when I was working on the car once,
started it with 3 or 4 plugs disconnected and idle stabilizer was able to keep
it idling fairly normal.

Timing belt jumped a tooth?  no light displayed, was retentioned recently 
I have not taken it apart yet, but from the way it is running, I fear this one
is the problem

Could it be a computer problem?I REALLY fear this one!

Fuel injector problem?  Rebuilt by Marren.

The car ran PERFECTLY and then it didnt.

Any advice?  I will keep you posted.  I have the flu, so it may be a few days
before I open her up.
