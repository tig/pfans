There are stickers and stickers. The sticker for the rear bumper saying
"928 S4" is something you can buy from any of the mail order parts houses.

However, separately, you should lift the mat in your trunk and look for a
white paper sticker off to the right (on top of the gas tank) with a lot of
numbers and codes on it. This is the build sticker I referred to in my
previous message, and contains all sorts of interesting information about
the exact configuration of your car. For general info on where this sticker
is and how to decode what it says, go to Phil Tong's Web site
(http://www.928s4vr.com) and go to the "Option Codes" page.

Specifically, as I mentioned, the code 302 means that Porsche put a model
designation sticker on the rear bumper when the car was built. If your car
once had a model designation sticker but doesn't now, this could be the
result of changing the bumper cover, or of the car being repainted, or of
the sticker being removed intentionally or otherwise.

Meanwhile, did you find your jack?
