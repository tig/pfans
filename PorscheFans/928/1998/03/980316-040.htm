It would appear that some folks on this list have already mastered these
techniques - you know who you are - however this may come in handy for the
rest of us mere mortals...


 How to Win Arguments, As it Were 
 ================================ 
  
 I argue very well. Ask any of my remaining friends. I can win an 
 argument on any topic, against any opponent.  People know this, and 
 steer clear of me at parties.  Often, as a sign of their great 
 respect, they don't even invite me.  You too can win arguments. 
 Simply follow these rules *: 
  
         * Drink Liquor. (JD) 
  
 Suppose you're at a party and some hotshot intellectual is  
 expounding on the economy of Peru, a subject you know nothing about.
 If you're drinking some health-fanatic drink like grapefruit juice, you'll
hang 
 back, afraid to display your ignorance, while the hotshot enthralls 
 your date.  But if you drink several large shots of Jack Daniels, you'll  
 discover you have STRONG VIEWS about the Peruvian economy.  
 You'll be a WEALTH of information.  You'll argue forcefully, offering 
 searing insights and possibly upsetting furniture.  People will be
impressed.  
 Some may leave the room. 
  
         * Make things up. 
  
 Suppose, in the Peruvian economy argument, you are trying to prove 
 Peruvians are underpaid, a position you base solely on the fact that 
 YOU are underpaid, and you're damned if you're going to let a bunch 
 of Peruvians be better off.  DON'T say: "I think Peruvians are 
 underpaid."  Say: "The average Peruvian's salary in 1981 dollars 
 adjusted for the revised tax base is $1,452.81 per annum, which is 
 $836.07 before the mean gross poverty level." 
  
         NOTE: Always make up exact figures. 
  
 If an opponent asks you where you got your information, make THAT 
 up, too.  Say: "This information comes from Dr. Hovel T. Moon's  
 study 
 for  the Buford Commission published May 9, 1982.  Didn't you read 
 it?" 
 Say this in the same tone of voice you would use to say "You left 
 your  soiled underwear in my bath house." 
  
         * Use meaningless but weightly-sounding words and phrases. 
  
         Memorize this list: 
  
                 Let me put it this way 
                 In terms of 
                 Vis-a-vis 
                 Per se 
                 As it were 
                 Qua 
                 So to speak 
  
 You should also memorize some Latin abbreviations such as  
 "Q.E.D.," 
 "e.g.," and "i.e."  These are all short for "I speak Latin, and you do 
 not." 
  
 Here's how to use these words and phrases.  Suppose you want to  
 say: 
  
 "Peruvians would like to order appetizers more often, but they don't 
 have enough money." 
  
 You never win arguments talking like that.  But you WILL win if you 
 say: "Let me put it this way.  In terms of appetizers vis-a-vis 
 Peruvians qua Peruvians, they would like to order them more often, 
 so  to speak, but they do not have enough money per se, as it were. 
 Q.E.D." 
  
 Only a fool would challenge that statement. 
  
         * Use snappy and irrelevant comebacks. 
  
 You need an arsenal of all-purpose irrelevent phrases to fire back 
 at  your opponents when they make valid points.  The best are: 
  
         You're begging the question. 
         You're being defensive. 
         Don't compare apples and oranges. 
         What are your parameters? 
  
 This last one is especially valuable.  Nobody, other than 
 mathematicians, has the vaguest idea what "parameters" means. 
  
 Here's how to use your comebacks: 
  
         You say                         As Abraham Lincoln said in 1873... 
         Your opponents says     Lincoln died in 1865. 
         You say                         You're begging the question. 
  
                              OR 
  
         You say                         Liberians, like most Asians... 
         Your opponents says     Liberia is in Africa. 
         You say                         You're being defensive. 
  
  
         * Compare your opponent to Adolf Hitler. 
  
 This is your heavy artillery, for when your opponent is obviously 
 right and you are spectacularly wrong. Bring Hitler up subtly. Say: 
 "That sounds suspiciously like something Adolf Hitler might say" or 
 "You certainly do remind me of Adolf Hitler." 
 
You now know how to out-argue anybody.  Do not try to 
pull any of this on people who generally carry weapons.
