Well, well, well...

Looks like I finally found a subject that NOBODY has an opinion on! (?)

Is that possible on this list?  ;-)

Talked to a Loctite rep. today, and he recommended that I use #599 Ultra 
Grey Gasket Maker for the oil pan.  It's supposedly designed for import 
engines.  It says on the package (and the tube) "Guaranteed not to 
leak"!  

(Hmmmmmm....   Now I'm thinking about that scene in the movie "Tommy 
Boy" when Chris Farley says, "I could take a crap in a box and mark it 
'Guaranteed' - and what-a-ya got - a guaranteed piece of sh_t!")

What-a-ya think fellow chum-chewers, should I or shouldn't I?
