Jim and Dean,

There is an alternative if the boot has recently split and the  joint is
truly not worn or has gotten dirty.
Go to your local Audi dealership and ask for the upper ball joint boot for
an 87 Audi 5000 Turbo (I think that is correct, Ed Ruiz correct me if I'm
wrong), also make sure you get the upper and lower retaining rings that hold
the boot in place.

It is an exact fit for the boot on your upper control arm.

Just make sure your ball joint is clean and pack the joint and rubber boot
with the proper grease and slip it on.

This was discussed at the VA Frenzy by Kim Crumb and others, and is done all
the time by knowledgeable mechanics who accidentally damage the boots when
working on the front suspension.
