Also, I saw an episode of Hot Rod Magazine on TV that briefly showed a
home powder coating system.... The down side is that, after
you=27ve baked the parts in your oven at 400*, you can=27t use the oven =
for
food preparation anymore - if you do, you may have to break out the big
Henkels to get through the glazed ham.

For anyone not familiar, powder coating kicks butt, and is fairly cheap.
 I saw that episode of Hot Rod TV and they were talking about the
Eastwood Company kit.  Sounds really cool but I can=27t imagine having an
extra oven around just for it.  Commercial powder coating is much
cheaper than body shop painting and 40 times more durable.  My 72
Mercedes coupe has a giant air cleaner (I mean big) and I had it done
for sixty bucks and the wheels for =2445 each.  I also had my 928 strut
brace (bar you see when you open the hood) done for like twenty but
David Roberts showed me that if you just strip the paint off those you
get nice shiney goodness for almost free.

Auto makers ought to powder coat body panels, but then I guess you=27d be
less likely to but a new car as often.  The process is enviornmentally
friendly too.  And it will give you amazing new pectoral muscles and
resulting self esteem.  Bill Gates got his start in powder coating.

What=27s a Henkel???
