Just to add what's already being said. I just had to remove the above
mentioned
and I found it a lot easier to remove the headlights first (fairly straight
forward).
Then I removed the individual headlight assemblies at the bar that makes
them 
pop up and the sleeves that hold them in firm. Sleeves or what you call
them
come loose by undoing the bolts from under the hood. Just have a look
you'll
know what I'm talking about.Then slide the Headlightmounts away and let
them rest
under the guard . All of the tricky bumper covernuts are now reasonably
accessible
for removal. It also helps to turn the stering hard to either side you are
working on.
All common sense stuff. Hope it helps. Cheers Tom
