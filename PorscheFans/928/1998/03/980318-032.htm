Whoa!  Here's where we all change our email alias' and mask our reply
addresses and relate our favourite tales, or we all go quiet for a while.
Could this be the email equivalent of standing on a street corner bragging
about drug dealing? :-)

How about a standard reply template:

From:  	Mr. X
Subject:	Criminal Dangerous Use of a Motor Vehicle

While car-racing should be carried out on a dedicated track and I don't
generally do this or support such irresponsible behaviour, the other day I
was at the lights next to a ___________ being driven by a _____________ in
a ___________ hat.  He gave me the finger/smiled at me/ revved his
engine/got chagrinned (delete one) and when the lights changed he
___________ and so I _____________  and then we _____________ to about
______ mph.  He was ________ feet in front of/behind me so I floored
it/changed down/burst into tears/mooned him.

Luckily we both saw funny side/I had a gun/it was dark.

Feel free to use it!
