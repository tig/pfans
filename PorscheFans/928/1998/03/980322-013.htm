Dan, you may try what I've done when my '79 developed a similar disorder.
ei; pull the motor for inspection first. You may find that it is simply
full of "crud". The procedure will require that you remove the door panel,
side window (from track) and possibly a portion of the elevator bracketry
as well as the motor itself. open the gear case. Check quality and quantity
of lubricant. Clean and re-pack. Also check condition of plastic guides on
the guide tube. Double check alignment in window guides upon
reinstallation. Check operation with a 12V power supply @ the motor leads. 

Apparently, your window motor is functional, to the extent that you are
able to actuate it, at least in one direction. Where as this direction is
"down", and Newton's law predicates an increased energy requirement to go
"up", we could suspect that there is possibly a binding force somewhere in
the "werks".

The forgoing inspections, cleaning, lubing, aligning, checking and
refitting probably took two hours of my time, required no parts
replacements and so far, my windows work great!

Good luck
