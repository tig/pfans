Mark,

That could possibly be the cause.  I haven't even checked  to see if the
same condition exists with the heater, as down here, the heater is hardly
ever used.  I've printed out your message and those of several other
members of the list and intend to dump the whole thing on my mechanic and
see if he can fix it.

Thanks

Gene
