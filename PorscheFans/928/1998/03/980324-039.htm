Please don't bother others while flaming me for this post.  If you MUST
respond with criticism, please reply privately.  Remember, I am not the
bandwidth police.

_Rhetorical_ question follows: Why are there so bloody many non-928 posts
on this list.  I enjoy the infusion of humor as much as anyone.  I am a
part-time comedian.

I believe that there is supposed to be a separate list for the "general"
stuff.  And certainly this is not the forum for personal "person-to-person"
messages, isn't it?

I REALLY enjoy the camaraderie of this list, and mean no offense.  I am a
good contributor, and have learned much as well.

Let's talk about the 928. . .OK.   Again, please don't bother others with
"public" flames about this post.

'83 928S
1965 Wife (who is afraid she will hurt the 928 if she drives it)
3 cats (who vomit profusely when riding in the 928)

Tip for the week:  "Mean Green" (available in southeastern grocery stores)
is an excellent and _cheap_ tire and engine cleaner!
