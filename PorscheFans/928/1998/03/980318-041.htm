Kyle,
Yes, I bought the GTS Upgrade Kit from Devek, which includes the GTS pressure
plate, release bearing, clutch disk, clutch guide tube, and release bearing
arm.
The cost of the Upgrade Kit is $847.50, and it includes everything above,
which only leaves a few items to make it a completely thorough job. 
The additional items I bought (also from Devek) are the bushing for the
release bearing arm ($9.50), the pilot bearing ($17.50), rear main seal
($11.00), and a tube of NR-Optimoly grease ($18.00). The Devek people are
great. They gave me excellent tech support and were very receptive to my needs
and questions thruout the job. 
The only miscelaneous trips I made were for the flywheel re-surfacing, a 1/2"
x 4" concrete floor anchor bolt, (to use as an internal expanding puller for
the pilot bearing) and a can of dry graphite spray.

>  Thanks again. That was much appreciated.
  
You're welcome, glad you found it helpful. 
Best Regards,
Greg Schickel
