Hi! everyone out there.  I'm a new member of the club, and I must say 
 that I'm very please to be a part of it.  I'm also a proud owner of a 
 1980, 928.  I have just inherited this   fine piece of machinery and I 
 would not change her for anything.  The car is in great condition but 
 as I have mentioned, it is a 1980 and things wear out with time. My 
 problems began the day that I decided to fix the lighting in the front 
 panel.  My panel would not light up, so i decided to take it apart, 
 and change the burned  bulb.  Of course, this is after I checked that 
 the fuse was good.  well I checked all of the bulbs, and they where 
 good.  So I decided to take it to the shop, to have someone  with 
 experience look at it.  After I put everything back, I found that my  
 left combination instrument, does not work.  The weird thing is that 
 the gas reader only fails to work. To add to my problems, the 
 tachometer also fails to work. Moreover, the radio is no  longer 
 working, there was no power at all. Then I noticed that   the inside 
 lights where not lighting up.  You know, doors/back and front.  Before 
 I take her to the shop, does anyone have any information or 
 explanation as to what would cause these  instruments to fail.  any 
 information is greatly appreciated. I'm also open for 
 negative/positive criticism.

Than you all.

Daniel
