The torque generated by the engine is great, but, I wanted to switch 
because of several reasons:
 1) I want more power (650hp min.).  And that means a more efficient 
supercharger. Also means I will need intercooling.  This is almost 
impossible with Roots.
 2) I want more stealth approach. Roots requires customized hood with 
cowl (which I have).
 3) My partner and I are prototyping a bolt-on supercharger kit on a 
couple of vehicles, this is one of them.
 4) I also am changing to an S4 engine (thanks to Paul Hatzilliades). The 
Roots system's custom intake manifold can only be used on '85-'86 4V 
engines.

The pistons were milled down slightly for a static compression ratio of 
7.5:1.
The engine is a drop-in for any 928--no special mods to the car, other 
than hood mods for blower clearancing (but I will include the modified 
hood I used).
