Dear fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

Those of you that know me know that I commonly refer to my 86.5 928S as an
"S3." the reasons are simple. It's the model just prior to the "S4", and has
the same brakes, among other things. It has been pointed out that the Euro
85s and 86s' were designated as "S2." That only make my point all the
stronger, (as pointed out by Andy) the Euro models were 16V 4.7L engines.
Clearly then, with the installation of the 32V 5.0L engines with the "S"
body, the internal designated by the factory for these cars was "S3."
Besides me, who else cares?

To remove the door panel the service manual helps considerably. However,
here are directions to do it without a manual. Open the inside door handle
to reveal the phillips tapered head screw, remove it and the cover beneath
the handle. Remove the leather panel by popping out the top tabs, then pull
it up and out. Two 10mm hex-head screws are now accessible. Remove them.
Remove the round air flow channel director at the front of the door (by the
jam). Remove the long hex-head screw now exposed. Open the door pocket and
take the black covers off the two hex-head screws in the pocket area. Remove
them. With a thin flat head screwdriver, remove the cover on the rotation
knob for the lock to expose a phillips head screw. Unscrew it and remove the
knob. Now unscrew the large round plate that is under the knob. Now,
carefully pop all the door panel tabs from their seats. Once they are all
off, pull the panel away from the door and then pull up. Take care not to
pull up too far as the mirror switch and wires will pull out. Note the wire
locations and disconnect them. With the panel off, the lock and the outer
handle mechanism can be seen from the inside. With the window all the way
up, you should be able to see what is causing the problem.

Good luck and happy motoring. Ed
