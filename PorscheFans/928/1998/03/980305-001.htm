>I just got a pen and ink drawing of a 928S4.  It was originally a 928S
>but artist inked a wing in.  His name and address is:

I have a few drawings of my 928.  It is a hobby of mine to draw cars.  I
keep meaning to scan some in and put them on my web site, but all I have
right now is a 944 I did for a friend.  Most of my work is in pencil, both
black and white and color.  You can see what I have at: 

http://stl.isx.com/~ipoertn/artwork/index.html

I never mentioned it before, because it takes me around six hours to do one
of them.  I do them on 18x24" 80lb paper.  If someone wants me to do a
drawing of their 928, send me an email and we'll talk about it.  Like I
said, it's a hobby.

Later...
