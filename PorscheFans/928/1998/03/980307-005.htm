Think about what you said regarding cosine error; it occurs only when the
RADAR beam and the target are not parallel; how does that affect rear-RADAR?

Car & Driver, lo these many years ago, reported in one of their articles on
detectors that RADAR in the hands of a cop traveling behind your car can be
used if the speed differential between your car and his is more that 10mph,
plus or minus. Also, a stationery cop can shoot you *after* you pass him and
are traveling away from him.

Well, friends, you have now. I was stopped for doing 90mph by a state trooper
here in Jersey (*New* Jersey for our brethren across the pond) who was parked
in the median behind bushes, and shot me from the rear after I passed him.
(Later dismissed when my attorney discovered the trooper had doctored his
calibration papers for the RADAR unit...it was just the serial number, but hey!)
