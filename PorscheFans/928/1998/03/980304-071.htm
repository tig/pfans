Of course you could but you would be wrong.  The 928 is definately a
Porsche and predated the 944 by many years.  Both are true Porsches (the
fake ones are less than full scale).

Who do you think designed the 928 from scratch back in the early 70's -
Mr. Toyota? 

Ok, roll call:

Ernst Fuhrmann - Chief Engineer (who later became Chairman)
Helmuth Bott - Engineering and Development
Wolfgang Eyb - Design Chief
Helmut Flegl - Project Director
Wolfhelm Gorrissen - Design Director
Anatole Lapine - 928 Designer
the rest of the "Porsche men of Weissach"

and naturally, Ferdinand Porsche himself.

You can call it the German Corvette but don't do it at the factory or
I'm sure you'll be escorted off the property never to be welcomed
again.  Most 928 owners are shark-skinned so we can take a little
ribbing from time to time, just watch the fins though ;)

So what other pedigree do we need?  (I have my factory cardex if that's
worth anything to you, although it's miscorrectly labeled 928 S4 instead
of 928 GT, thank you PCNA I'm still waiting for the corrected
version).   There is just too much misinformation and basic lack of
knowledge on the market regarding the 928 (and 924/944 as well).  But
all the better for us as secondary buyers, who lust after the best GT
cars Porsche doesn't build anymore.

Let's address one more point too since I know it will come up - some
consider the 928 a non-Porsche because of it's powertrain.  C'mon now -
don't be silly!  Porsche has a long history of utilizing "which solution
would bring the greatest gains". 

The awesome 928 and the much beloved 911 are just two examples in a long
list of electric, 4, 6, 8 cylinder, even V-16 air/oil-cooled or
water-cooled, normally or abnormally aspirated, front , mid or
rear-engined *Porsches*.  And how 'bout them human powered Porsches too!

Now I don't know about all that detuning of the 928 engine to allow the
911 to be faster kind of stuff, this is the first I've ever heard of
that.  All texts I have indicate Porsche did what I've already stated
and the power outputs came about in deference to many factors including
gas consumption, noise levels, competing manufactureres offerings, etc.
so that may have been just one writer's opinions.  FWIW the 928 stood at
the top of Porsche's offerings many times as the fastest in the model
line up (noted U.S. 911 turbo import exclusions, although we bettered
them too a few times), so this also does not jibe with that other post.

I just preached "Porsche solidarity" over in the Porsche NG and suggest
same here and for all Porsche owners worldwide.  Let's all revel in the
joys of owning and driving the true ultimate sportscars and leave the
proving to the track.  In the least we are all  wasserpumpers now, and
the 944 owners I met at the GGR-AX are every bit as fun as the 928
owners.  A might bit faster too at least in GGR but give us newbies a
chance this year!

That said, you might not want to be a corner worker when I come out
although I am improving!
