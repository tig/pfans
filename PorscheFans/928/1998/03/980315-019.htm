Shark Chums:

I was RTFM'ing (...proper use of the apostrophe??  Don't care!) this
morning, looking at ATF changes and some other need-to-do tasks like
lubricating my [lug]nuts.  Strolled into the section on the tire pressure
sensors.  According to the factory bible,  the tire pressure sensors were
introduced in MY 1989, but not on U.S. models.  Your early production/sale
date would pretty much eliminate the chance that you are suffering from the
RDK malfuntion.

To confirm the lack of pressure sensors, take a peek inside the wheel rims
for the pressure sensors.  There will be two sensors 180 degrees apart on
the wheel, mounted through the flat area inboard of the caliper.  No sensors
there, no RDK.


I wasn't tuned into the 'sensor prufen' message back in section 38;  That
would have to be up in the front in section 1A I think.  More later as time
allows.
