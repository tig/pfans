  One weekend James, Elliott, Jerry, and I were driving down an open 
  stretch of Texas highway after an Austin 928 group gathering.  Traffic
  was fairly light, so when we had to pass a car we would take turns
  at running point.  At the time, James had the bypass setup on his
  S4 but Elliott hadn't installed his yet.  I can assure you that when
  an S4 with sport pipes blasts by you at full revs and triple digit 
  speeds, you KNOW that the exhaust isn't stock.  As I later told James, 
  the tone sounded like that of the Cosworth-powered F1 cars that I used to 
  go watch at the Detroit Grand Prix!  Fantastic!
