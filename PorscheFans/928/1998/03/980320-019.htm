As many of you know, I have been working on a hybrid for the
last 9 months. Well, this is the end of the third trimester and
this baby is about to pop. OK, OK, I've been driving it around
the neighborhood for the last 4 or 5 months, breaking the motor
in...but it is just now reaching the point where I can drive it
to work and show the rest of the autophiles what a supercar
really is! (hey, there's a Pantera, a 98 Vette, a Boxter, 
(2) 968s, another 928, (3) 911s, a full CP Class Camaro, a
Vortex'ed Z-28 [550 HP rear wheels!], Cobra Replica, CP Mustang
and alot of other wannabees!)


Well, the hybrid is two steps away from being ready for
TX DMV inspection and I just wanted to say thanks to a
long list of those who made this possible. This list is
in no particular order and I hope no one was left off:

David Roberts --> thanks for the super deals on the GT suspension
                  and brakes along with expert advice and friendly
                  support!
                  
Mark Anderson --> thanks for all of the premium parts and pieces
                  for all of those hard to find and important things
                  such as that power steering hose and door handle.
                  
David @ PAP   --> thanks for the quick location of the missing link
                  (those halfshafts) and the great deal on them.
                  
James Morrison -> thanks for the used tires. They'll be toast in a 
                  matter of miles! Also, thanks for your support and
                  I really _am_ almost ready to drive it over to
                  your place.
                  
Jim Stadter   --> thanks for loaning me your Workshop Manuals. I
                  _absolutely_ couldn't have done this without them.
                  Also, thanks for the great deal on the master
                  cylinder and the use of your flare nut wrench.
                  
James Albright -> thanks for the newer interior. The car looks totally
                  presentable to those who just don't *even* understand
                  what the car _really_ is now.
                  
I wouldn't even _think_ of instigating a riot here by listing people 
that were contributers and support for the non-German components...
aside from one who is an exception because he is a fellow 928'er. In
fact, his car is in the latest Devek catalog.

Paul Carver   --> thanks for the tips on how to set up a FlowMaster
                  exhaust system for a 928. Not a "bolt on" swap, but
                  a perfect solution for a motor the size of which I
                  am running.
                  

Austin 928'ers -> thanks for all of your support. It's great to be
                  associated with such a cool group.
                  

                       

Please forgive me if I've left anyone out. Well, you might notice an
obvious ommision, but someone once said, "if you can't say something
nice about someone, say nothing at all".  Don't worry, it wasn't
anyone from the 928 list!  If you figure it out, offline on this, please.


Thanks to everyone on the list for all of the useful knowledge and
special thanks to all those that privately sent me e-mail in support!
(You know who you are, I won't flush you out. Some people may not
approve. As if you were some sort of "defector" ;-) )


The last two steps:    4 wheel allignment
                       weld up the exhaust system

  79 thru 90GT 928 hybrid 5-speed (black/black&grey)

BTW - There's still room for improvement on this project...in the near
      future.
