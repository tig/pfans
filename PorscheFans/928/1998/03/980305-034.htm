I have had great success with two products for improving the condition
of interior leather and vinyl surfaces.  The cleaner is " Vinyl and
Leather Cleaner" by Eagle One.  This product cleans soiled leather and
vinyl exceptionally well, though I would NOT use it for routine cleaning
due to it's possible agressive nature.  I follow the treatment
immediately with Mothers leather conditioner, which is a very rich
lotion.  After allowing the conditioner to stand for a few minutes and
buffing with a soft towel, the leather looks great!!!!  I also like the
MacGuires swirl remover alot for those fine marks and swirls.  Another
product not spoken about much, but I have discovered for paint cleaning
is the use of a clay pad to clean the paint.
