Fellow Shark Chums:

Phil and others have notes about coating the lug nut threads.  My two sense
on this subject:

The effects of galvanic corrosion of the alloy (titanium or aluminum) can be
reduced some by coating the THREADS of the lug bolt/stud with something
sacrificial.  One of the Never-Seize flavors would be fine, either the
copper or the lead-based.  Here's the catch, though-- You can't get any on
the cupped face of the nut or in the mating recess on the wheel.  None!
Nada!  The friction at the face in the cup area must be maintained as clean
metal contact.

So, work on your application technique without the wheel.  Put a little on
the threads and install the lug nuts, then remove them, wipe as much off as
you can from the stud, etc.  Then clean the lug nut thoroughly, first in
solvent, then with detergent and water to remove any stray never-seize thay
may have gotten on the face of the nut.  Reinstall the nuts, then remove and
inspect for stray coating one last time.  If you are satisfied, go ahead and
put the wheel on now, and torque to specification.


One other thought:  The galvanic corrosion will sacrifice the aluminum nut
rather than the steel stud.  I don't know the cost of new replacement nuts
(somebody chime in here with best source/cost).  It may be easy to justify
periodic replacement of the nuts instead of the risky stud lubrication
procedure.  If there is a white powdery residue in the threads of either the
nut or the stud,  you need to look for replacement nuts anyway.  I can't
remember ever seeing a factory-recommended procedure for lubricating wheel
stud threads, while I can refer to several manufacturers that specifically
recommend against it.


Good Luck!
