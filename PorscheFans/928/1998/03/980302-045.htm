<<I used to detail cars and a trick that we used to get swirl marks out
was 
to buff (using an orbital buffer) the car with dry corn starch after
removing the oxidization. >>

Not that I am any kind of expert on this, but I would highly advise all
of you to NEVER buff the paint on your cars with anything electric
(unless your paint is horribly faded).  Like I said, I am not an expert,
but I do perform auto detailing here at my shop and those of you who
have seen my black 87 928S4 and 79 930 (both original paint) will attest
that I am doing something right.  The reasons that I do not like buffers
are:
1.  The compund you must use with them gets into cracks/nooks and
crevices and just plain looks bad.  It is also very harsh on paint.
2.  Auto paint is like your skin, and applying wax and polish to your
paint is the same thing as putting lotion on your skin .  The sun will
dry out both your paint and your skin, as will heat (which is what
buffers produce from 1200+ rpm).  So, in effect, by using a buffer you
are negating the purpose of putting polish on your paint by the heat and
friction you produce.
3.  It is a lot more personal and you can "fix" minor problems easier by
polishing your car by hand.

From my experience, I would recommend that you just use high quality
products and forget baking soda and corn starch and rubbing compound. 
Here is a list of what I use to maintain my cars:
1. Turtle Wax bug & tar remover- gets off all oxidation and
bugs/tar/etc.  Do entire car 1X per year.
2. Zymol paint cleanse- same thing as using clay to clean paint.  Do
entire car 1X per year.
3. Zymol auto bathe- car wash.  1X per week. 
4. Zymol polish (the kind still made by Zymol & not turtle wax).  1X per
month.
5. Zymol carbon or creme wax (depending on paint color).  1X per month.
6. Lexol leatehr protectant for your interiors.  2X per month.

Yes Zymol is expensive, but it is the best.  Yes it requires some sweat
and elbow grease to do all of the above, but aren't our Porsches worth
it?  No, I have no stock in Zymol wax and I do not distribute it - just
a very satisfied customer.
