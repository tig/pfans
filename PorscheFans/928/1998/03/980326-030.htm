Not necessarily, even though stick '89 S4s are rare. There are two places
to check for info relevant to this (and to other things as well). First,
lift the mat in your trunk and look for a white paper sticker off to the
right (actually on top of the gas tank). This is your "build sticker and
contains all sorts of valuable info in code. Go to Phil Tong's Web site
(http://www.928s4vr.com) and then to the "Option Codes" page for
instructions on how to decode that info.

Specifically, if you find code 639, you have a GT. However, absence of this
code does not mean you don't. However, look for a line on the sticker which
will read one of the following three ways:
	M2841-81K G2812-2K (indicates a stick S4 with limited slip diff)
	M2841-81K G2812-1K (indicates a stick S4 without limited slip diff)
	M2847-85K G2855-2K (indicates a GT with limited slip diff)

If these codes are not evident on the build sticker, raise the hood and
look at the top front of the engine block (behind and to the right of the
dipstick; check the owner's manual for a picture) for a horizontal flat
surface stamped with some codes. The top line will read "M28/41" for a
stick S4's engine or "M28/47" for a GT's engine.

You can do this yourself, but it is a lot of labor and requires a special
tool (which you can rent) and detailed instructions (best found in the shop
manual). Having a dealer do it costs a lot but gives you a two year parts
and labor warranty, which be very handy if the new belt breaks and takes
some valves with it. Regardless of who does the belt, give consideration to
replacing the water pump at the same time. The main timing belt drives the
pump, and the only way to get to the pump is to take off the belt, so you
can get more bang for your labor buck. Also, within about 1000 miles after
installation, have the new belt retensioned (this needs the special tool).
Thereafter, check tension every 15,000 miles.
