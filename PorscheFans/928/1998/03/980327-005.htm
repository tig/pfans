They would be nice but its not a complicated ordeal normally.  there is
2(?) hexbolts in the front and back of each track.  Then just take the
seat out slowly and
make sure you disconnect the seat harness(es depending on the model) and
you
are there.

In your case, with a seat that does not move, it is a bit hard to get to
either the front or
rear bolts.  You might want to have someone climb in the back seat and
try to assist the
seat to move either forward (or backward) while you activate the motor.
Don't try
this too long as you do not want to burn the motor.

The only other advice I have is to look out for the metal tab that the
front bolts
screw into.  The front bolt actually do not screw on the rail but into a
piece of
metal behind it.  When the 2 bolts are off, that piece will fall and has
a tendency
to slide into the rail.  Retrieval is difficult but luckily, it is
magnetic so a magnet is
the way to go.  The rear bolts do screw in the rail so no special
precaution there.
