My guess would be that the delay has more to do with the production
process than the capability of the tire. I have no idea how you hand-
make a tire, but that must be what they did for the test tires, and
the translation to a production line is probably the hard part of a
new tire design. So, "just because it's propaganda doesn't mean it's
not true," or something like that.
