Fred,

This may really be a great deal . . . and I may get back together with my
black-hearted ex-wife.    Maybe that's all that needs doing.    But then why
did the car get parked?   =20

Plan on spending twice the selling price to make a decent street machine
out of it, THEN paint it, etc.   =20

My bottom line is that this car is probably no more of a money pit than
a bad cocaine habit.    If you can afford it, go for it.

Check/replace the timing belt BEFORE you even crank the engine.

Fingers crossed for you.

Dave
