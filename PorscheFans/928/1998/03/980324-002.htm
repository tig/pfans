  Another thing:   with the A/C work, hoses get leaned on and
inadverterntly twisted/stressed.   If you just that that 'whiff', it
could be small dripping over the engine, instead of where you can see it
puddle!    You didn't mention checking tightness of clamps, but those
little boogers along the passenger fenderwell through the 'Y' tube and
on into the tank should be checked.

Good luck.
