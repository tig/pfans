  There  have been several comments on the ride and stiffness
characteristics of the 928. I have had an '86S 5-speed for several
months, and I finally got around to adjusting the ride height. The PO
(previous owner) had dropped the car more than I had realized. After
several hours of effort, The car is at factory spec ride height at all
four corners.

The improvement in ride and handling was surprising. The car did "bound"
when I hit a dip or large bump, and I thought that the shocks were weak.
Nope, it is now apparent that I was hitting the bump stops.

The car doesn't look as good as it did, and I now have about two inches
of gap between the front tires and fenders, but the improvement in ride
and handling make it worthwhile.

I made two simple tools to help in the job.

To measure the ride height, take a spring clip (such as is normally used
to clip a large stack of paper - two wire handles and a U-shaped spring
of black steel), and two 3 1/2" flat sticks of wood or metal - popsicle
sticks, cut-off ruler sections, etc. Clip the sticks together, put the
tool between the floor and the measuring points, slide the sticks till
they fit, take the tool out and measure. Any kind of clamp or locking
plier would also work.

To turn the spring adjusters, the Yamaha spanner in a recent post would
be better, but I didn't have one. I rummaged in the tool box and found a
cheap ($3-4) "slip joint wrench". This is an adjustable Y-shaped wrench
normally used to tighten slip nuts on sink drains. I ground one of the
jaws so that it had a hook to catch the slots. Worked OK, but a longer
handle would have made turing the adjusters easier.
