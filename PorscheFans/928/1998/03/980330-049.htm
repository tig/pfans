This is my first post to the list so please be patient with me.  I
purchased an '81 928 last year and I have slowly been fixing it up.  I
repaired the rear hatch wiper motor but was surprised when pressing the
center console activation switch would only engage the wiper for two
passes of the window. (snip)

Joe:

The rear wiper (at least on my S4) is only supposed to make a couple
passes across the window per activation. I think mine goes 3 times. As I
recall, this is mentioned in the owner's manual that lives in the
glovebox. The good news may be that you now have a perfectly operating
rear wiper! 

As for those other electrical mysteries you're discovering, good luck -
you've found where the gremlins live in the 928.
