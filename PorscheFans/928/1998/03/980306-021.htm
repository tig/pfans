Folks,

I would like to add some experience and reality to the SS brake line 
discussion.  First, the brake lines that are prone to failure are the 
teflon lined SS hoses.  These hoses are manufactured by various companies 
for industrial usage.  (IE Aeroquip, etc.)  These hoses and fittings are 
typically rated to 3500 psi burst and 1100 psi working.  This is fine for 
their normal intended use.  (Oil lines, etc.)

However, brake system pressures are in the area of 1200 to 1400 psi.   As 
you all will notice, this is well under the burst rating.  However, after 
numerous applications at 1200 psi, the teflon lining cold flows at the 
fitting.  This allows the grip that the fitting has on the teflon lining 
 to reduce and then at some point fail the connection.  The exterior SS 
weave will typically stay in place but since this is a weave it allows 
brake fluid to pass through quite well.

This causes a pressure failure at the caliper it is attached to.  If one 
were to calculate the amount of displacement of the pistons in the typical 
four pot bremo caliper during brake application, it would been seen that 
less than 1.62 cc of brake fluid is displaced per caliper.  (please note 
that the above calculation does not take into account caliper flex or line 
expansion.)  Therefore, even a quite small leak will cause "Brake failure".

The dot SS lines have a kevlar or other high tensile fabric reinforced 
rubber (typically buna-n) inner liner.  This is the same liner type as the 
OEM "rubber" lines.

From my experience, the typical OEM lines do have a very slight amount more 
flex then the SS DOT lines.(<.2%)  However, it would be impossible to feel 
the difference at the pedal due to the booster, ABS, system flex, etc.

The moral of the above is:  Make sure what materials are used in the SS 
lines.  If your supplier does not know, stick with OEM.  They are just as 
good, but not as pretty.

I can certainly agree that one could feel a difference on a motorcycle, due 
to the very long flexible lines and the lack of boosters, ABS etc.  Also, 
the very small sizes of pistons and master cylinders, plus the mechanical 
leverage built in to the brake system, accentuates the "feel" of the brake 
line flex.

Sorry for this long and windy post. Also, please forgive any punctuation or 
grammatical errors.  I am, after all, just a graduate engineer.  They left 
out English 101.  Or I was drunk, it was during the freshman year, after 
all!

Regards.
