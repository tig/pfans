  Well...  According to the tire makers, yes _and_ no.  Glenn didn't
  specify which profile was to be used with the 245's.  Leonard is 
  correct in that a 245/45-16 won't fit on a 7" rim, but a 245/50-16 
  will.  As to whether you're better off with a 245/50 vs a 225/50, the
  proper answer is probably no. 
  
  BUT!, as an owner of a car originally delivered without rear wheel 
  spacers, I can tell you that 225/50's on the rears look damn puny in 
  those big wheel wells.  After owning the car for a year, I just couldn't 
  stand it anymore and had to break the Porsche credence of function over
  form by installing 245/50s.  They ended up working fine on both road and 
  track so I attest that they are a viable alternative.
  
  As Leonard pointed out, the proper solution is to upgrade to wider rims
  to accomodate the 245/45-16 that the factory has specified.  I knew this
  all along and finally upgraded my rims last year, so make sure those
  flame throwers are turned on low heat before scolding me.
