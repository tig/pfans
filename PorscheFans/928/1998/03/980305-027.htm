Actually, the scanning process took away a lot of the quality in the color
of the original.  ie., Where it looks like it has a lot of white spots in
the black on the front, was originally solid black and a lot of the white
on top is really a sort of light gray.

About bribing me...  It's just a hobby and so far I have done all of my
drawings for the cost of paper, film for photos of the car, and cost of
photocopies I made to get a better view of details, which is usually around
$10.  I tell you what Phil, send me some photos of your car that you'd like
to see turned into a drawing and I'll see what I can do.  Once I'm done,
I'll send the drawing back to you with the receipts for any photocopies
I've made.  If you like the drawing then all I ask is that you pay me for
the photocopies and send me an owner's club t-shirt and business cards:)  

Since you are the first person to ask me about actually doing it for them
off the list, this will tie me up from doing it for anyone else until I'm
done.  This way, if I get a sudden rush of demands, I will have someone
else's opinion as to what my drawings are worth.  I can't spend six hours a
pop and not get something in return for my time.

My address is:
