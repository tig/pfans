Thank you Loma Prieta Region for the good time at AX #2 today!

My first AX ever was with your region last year, and today's event marks
my third.  And also my nephew Jeremy's 9th birthday - he wanted me to
tell everyone he had a good time too!  

At one point this morning right before my run group I started to panic -
just where is Jeremy???  Couldn't find him in the pits!  Thankfully, he
was safe (and warm) inside a LPR member's support van watching tv. 
Whoever extended that courtesy - A Big Thanks - 3Com was freezing!!! 

So, back to birthday cake.  Just wanted to get this out before the day
was done.  See you all soon at AX #3 I hope!
