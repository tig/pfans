Sorry all but I can't stop ranting about these things!

Snuck away earlier today under the guise of "I have to bring
the old oil to the recycling center!" and took ole' Blue
out.  Getting quite adept at throttle settings which change
the tone of the exhaust note - sometimes the sound is almost
a musical note (in a throaty V8 kinda' way).  Again, tripped
out at part throttle steady state cruising where the exhaust
sound just picks up and hides away somewhere - silent but
deadly - then throttle through a tunnel BWWAAAAHHHHH heh heh
heh!

***

The wide angle / magnifying rear view mirror I put on is a
"Broadway".  Does not interfere with sun visors at all and
really helps rearward vision ALOT, I am watching back
traffic frequently nowadays!

***

Anyone else going to the AX this weekend at 3Com?  Have tuna
sandwiches, will trade!

***

Anyone else try that shifter recover kit from AGLA (Alan
Gun)?  Thinking about that vs. buying GTS shifter...

Ok, gotta' run again.  Back later.  If anyone saved my post
about Mark Anderson's RDK bypass procedure go ahead and
repost, I will rewrite for the FAQ!

phil
vroom!
