I think some of the points on both sides have merit. I want a choice, in
spite of a negative insider experience in the rebuilt automotive
electronics business. Basically somebody landed a contract to provide a
particular "rebuilt" electronic gizmo for a national parts chain.
Because the OEM sub-components used were not available on the open
market the product was "redesigned". Rather than characterizing the
factory part over the operational range they were simply using 2 or 3
points and thought to rebuild these things with minimum wage labor. Lets
not forget the "redesign" barely worked on the workbench but failed
almost instantly when a little hot air hit it. Fortunately that was only
the beginning of the problems and the contract defaulted, I think,
because that was the last I heard of it.

Still, I believe a rebuilt part *could* be as good or better than OEM,
or even new OEM. I believe there are Americans who know how to rebuild a
German water pump to better than new quality. When I buy bearings I'll
typically look for Timken or SDK. If its a special bearing then I'll buy
Porsche which is usually marked SDK.

Have seen Porsche shirts, jackets, watches, and sunglasses. But haven't
seen any Porsche pants or slacks. I think we really truly need genuine
Porsche Pants to get that properly calibrated Porsche-seat-of-the-pants
kick-in-the-butt experience!  ;-)

In all seriousnes, however good Porsche parts are they would not be this
good if there was not an alternative.
