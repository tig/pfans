Thinking about this more, did you mean my other post to the racing list
about spinning my tires out of the slalom?

In that case I have to note:

1. Candlestick parking lot is not the best surface to begin with
(pebbles, cold, etc.)
2. I spun to redline in 1st - subsequent runs in 2nd much better!
3. Getting Differential Lock warnings now and not looking forward to
procedures!
Still seems to be working though...

Ok, now a lurking I will go...(sneaky shark sounds from Jaws playing in
background)
