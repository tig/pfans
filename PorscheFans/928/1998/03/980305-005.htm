Kevin's point is that the factory rubber ones don't expand noticably
even under some very tough racing conditions.  That's pretty valuable
info to me.

Kevin's been very generous in helping me with ?'s on installing a LSD in
my 5sp (even though he doesn't own or usually work on 928's).  He wrote
a long detailed response which will end up in our FAQ once I'm done. 
The guy really knows tranny's, I think he maintain's the 944 FAQ now,
and, from what I've seen on the 944 list, is just one h*** of a nice
guy.

On these lists, it's much better to take it easy with any fire power
until you check the guy out - otherwise you drive away some great
people.  John's opening line should've served as enough of a warning
that this guy indeed knows whereof he speaks.
