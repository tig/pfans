The computer dash (Porsche's version of "Tokyo by night"; I'm happy not to
have it) calculates all kinds of things requiring sensors, at least as many
as the conventional dash's warning light array. Like other computers, it
does a self-test and system test when it turns on.

If it can't find the external sensors, or if it gets inappropriate messages
from them, it will ask you, apparently in its native language, to test the
sensors. Because it's not indicating a specific sensor fault, it may have
lost contact with all of them, so check for loose or corroded connectors.
It's also possible that, since RDK was available on some '89 cars, the
computer has forgotten how it was set up and is now looking for the RDK brain.

As they should. All tire pressure specs assume the tires are cold (e.g.,
having sat in a garage overnight and not driven since). Driving heats up
the tires. A dependable rule of thumb is to assume that sustained highway
driving heats them up enough to raise the pressure by about 8 psi over cold
indication (poking around at lower speeds adds 3-5 psi).

So, if you're checking your tires hot, put in 8 psi more than the cold
spec, then recheck the next morning when the tires are truly cold. DON'T
bleed out air when you check your hot tires and find high pressures.
