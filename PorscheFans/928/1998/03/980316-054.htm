     BOTH PROBLEMS SOLVED!  
     
     I connected the white wire going to the antenna amp to the Remote 
     Power output of the AM/FM-CD unit and the radio reception improved 
     dramatically.
     
     Rechecked power and ground connections to the AM/FM-CD and amp units, 
     then rewired continuous 12 volt power to a closer power source. Hiss 
     was still present. During this checking and rewiring effort I realized 
     a potential noise source. Two sets of 10ft long shielded RCA preamp 
     cables were used to get signals back to the rear mounted amp. I had 
     laid these under the passenger side carpet along fuse box area near 
     the footwell then along the outside of the passenger seat. The cables 
     were laying next to some control electronics under the board that 
     covers the fuse box. I re-routed the preamp cables under the center 
     console carpet and then under the passenger seat. VOILA! The noise 
     went away. Even though the cables were shielded, close proximity to 
     the active electronics caused the interference.
     
     Thanks to David Roberts and Brian Malm for their helpful tips.
