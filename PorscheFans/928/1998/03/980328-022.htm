I have a few more "Shark" issues after spending the day on my back in
the driveway and would appreciate your input.

1. I need the L&R vertical plastic wheelwell liners for the front, or at
least the foam gaskets that surround them. What sources are available?

2. What's the little gizmo that looks like a pump or motor hidden in the
front of the drivers side wheelwell?

3. What does the rubber hose from the bottom of the master cylinder do
and where does it go? Mine is just about rotting off the nipple.

4. I need a bottom front spoiler & the air inlet flap/vane assembly. Any
sources?

5. I went for a drive today, who wouldn't, 75 and sunny, and when I
turned off the car, the electric fans stayed on. I though nothing of it
as they went off when I raised the hood and started to go over the
motor. When I was finished, 5 hours later, I closed the hood and they
started again. They'd still be going I think but I popped the hood after
putting it in the garage. What's up with this???

Enough already. Lets' see what I find after tomorrow's exploration.

BTW - I hope to meet some of you at the Porsche Swap Meet. Do you think
we can have them segregate a Shark Pool in the the Porsche parking lot?

RIP F. Porsche

I Still Love this car.
