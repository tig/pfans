<<Anyway, I was wondering if anyone with a going Shark had actually met
one on
the pavement?  I know they develop a lot of power and presumably torque,
but
do the cars in street form, actually translate it to the ground?  And
then,
there is the other fact that they really are UGLY looking, but I said
that.>>

Roger,
I have had both a 95 RT/10 and a 96 GTS in my possession, and I must
regretably tell you that a Viper will romp over just about anything - as
long as it's in a straight line.  The cars do put their power to the
ground very well, and just about any idiot can get a 4 sec 0-60 out of
one.  Vipers aren't great looking, they are fairly simple cars, the
brakes stink and the interior is out of a Dodge Ram truck, but they will
beat anything 0-60 short of a 911 twin turbo or Ferrari 355 and
F40/50.   But hey, who CAN'T make a 488 cu. inch car fast?   
Sorry.             =(
