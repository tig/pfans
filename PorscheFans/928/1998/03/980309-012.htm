Just returned from a 1200 mile midwestern road trip that included such
fine cities as Terre Haute, IN, Peoria, IL and Kirksville, MO. The 928
performed flawlessly (as always)  I did find out that my speedometer
reads accuratly at 90 mph however. 

No, I wasn't using any protection, so I might have avoided this, but . .
.. And no, I wasn't showing any one up or racing or whatever, I was doing
what this car was made to do, cruise at high(er than normal) speeds.

So I see the patrol car in my rear view mirror about 1/2 - 1/4 of a mile
behind and I slow down and move over to the right lane. The state
trooper (IL) zooms up behind me and hits the lights. I pull over trying
to remember everything I read in "How to avoid getting speeding tickets"
and act accordingly. The trooper comes up and asks (in that real mean
way they have) for my license and proof of insurance. He looks over the
insurance card and hands it back. He also takes a very long look around
the interior of the car (at which time, I'm glad I wasn't using the
detector/jammer) He takes the license and stomps back to his car. 

For me, this was the first time getting pulled over in the 928, but I
figure, it couldn't last forever, oh well, I mean I was speeding after
all, and there are consequnces . . . 

After that extremely long 5 minutes, in which you wonder if your records
have been switched with someone elses, because, it just can't take this
long, can it? Another trooper pulls up. Oh great! What's going on now?
(horrid thoughts of my car being searched, drug sniffing dogs tearing up
the leather, etc., are racing through my head) And the first trooper
gets out and walks up to the window as the second one is eyeballing the
car and walks up the passenger side.

The first one looks at me and asks "This has a V8 in it, doesn't it?" I
happily answer "Yes!" and he looks over the top of the car at the second
trooper and says "Told ya!"  The second trooper has worked his way to
the front of the car and asks me to pop the hood, I do and get out to
open it and we then proceed to chit chat about the car, Porsches, 928s
and fast cars in general.  The whole time he still has my license and a
clipboard in his hand, so I'm still just waiting for the damage . . .

After about ten minutes, the second trooper says that they should get
going, so the first one asks me "How fast were you going back there?" I
sheepishly reply "70-75?" He breaks into a grin and says "I got you a
little faster than that, radar had you at 90. Here is a written warning,
be careful"  And that's it, whew!

After getting to where I was going that evening, I actually read the
warning "Speeding, 73 in a 65"

So remember, be nice, and like someone else posted a while ago, they are
as interested in cars as we are, so get them talking . . .
