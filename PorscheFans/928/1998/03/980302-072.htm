Hey all right - another shark at the strip!  How did the car fare?

You will learn that sharkers aren't putting K&N's on for increased
performance since the factory has pretty much optimized our current
intakes already.  Some have reported the K&N's pass fine particles which
they've found collecting on the insides of the filter housing.  How
detrimental this may be is questionable, as many of the 200k mile 928's
I've seen have K&N's sitting in them.  Dirty as all H_ but still running
strong.

If you really are going after tenths, hang on for a moment there's
something 'cool' coming up soon.  Note it will change your rating on the
"is this a 928" scale.  But hell, I polished my strut bar so lost .5
already ???
