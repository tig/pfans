Dan,

Sounds to me like it might be something loose in your front end.  Could 
be your ball joints (have you upgraded to the steel ones yet?), or wheel 
bearings.  Jack the front end up and see if you can wiggle to wheels any 
side to side and top to bottom.  Does the car wander at all on the 
highway?

Just some ideas...
