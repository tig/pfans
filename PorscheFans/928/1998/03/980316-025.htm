Dear George and the rest of the fellow "Land Shark" tamers:

    That was I with the panel directions.
    The torque setting for the lug nuts is actually 130 Nm which most
closely converts to 96 ft #s. At Potomac Region track events, we require
that they be torqued to at least 94 ft #s.
    Speakin of track events, we just had one on 3/15 at Summit Point, WV,
where six 928s showed up. Three in the "Green" group, one (me) in the
"Blue", one in "White" and one in "Black." I certainly had a blast, since in
the last session I passed about a dozen in front of me, and was passed by
none.
    To the person showing 2-3 bar at high RPM, get that checked out. My car
at idle is 2 bar and above 3k rpm shows no less that 4 bar (usually 5 bar)
with Mobil 1 (10w-30 in the Fall & Winter, 15w-50 in the Spring and Summer).

Happy motoring. Ed
