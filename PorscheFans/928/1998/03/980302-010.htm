Greg,

  Where were you able to order just the bushings for the rear coupler?  I
  asked the dealer about this and they told me I'd have to buy the complete
  coupler.  Automotion had them listed for 911s but not 928s.
  
  FWIW, Patrick (the Austinite that is building the hybrid Porschev) was told
  by Mark Anderson to use a propane torch to heat the small hex bolt that is
  used to secure the rear coupler.  The bolt must be easy to strip and heating
  will help prevent that.
  
  Also, I went to check the play in the rear coupler in my car and, like you,
  I thought it was significant.  Unfortunately, while trying to gain access
  to it, the protective boot ripped.  The boot has a thick embedded rubber
  ring on one end that is very difficult to slide over the wide coupler.
  Chances are good that yours will rip as well, so you may want to just order
  a new one before you make the installation.
  
  Finally, when I thought I needed a new rear coupler, I ordered a used one
  from Mark (928 Int'l) since they had one in stock that was in good condition.
  When I got the part, I found that the play in my original coupler was the
  same as the one I received.  Just to verify how much play exists in a brand
  new coupler, I went to the dealer and looked at one they had in stock.  The
  play on it was exactly the same as mine and the one Mark sent me.  Needless
  to say, I've just left mine alone (and Mark had no problem with me returning
  the one he sent me).  The moral of the story is that there is what I consider
  to be a significant amount of play in the coupler by design.
  
  Let us know how the installation goes.
