Actually, I have read quite a bit about what has come to be called "Mad
Blower Syndrome".  Max Fruelingheusen, in his definitive "Porsche:  The
Unknown Stories", discusses the wiring harnesses that were installed up to
MY88 or so to facilitate the planned for but never completed boost equipment
for the S-S4 engines.  The way it was supposed to work was for the hatch to
automatically open under maximum throttle, after the secondaries in the
intake plenum opened, and a blast of air to be forced out of the open
hatch...thus the wildly operating blower motor.

The original plan was for a fuel injector nozzle to be installed with the
hatch release.  When maximum power was attained, the driver could, at his
option, pull the hatch release knob (early versions specified the passenger
or "co-pilot" as the manual said, could pull the knob on the opposite side),
and the fuel would be ignited, giving an afterburner type performance boost.

According to Fruelingheusen, plans for the final installation were scrapped
when it was discovered that in some cases, when passing eighteen wheelers,
for example, the hatch would open too much, and the afterburner would
actually work in reverse.  The damage to test mules was the destruction of
the luggage covers, which, Fruelingheusen surmises (page 89) is the reason
that there is such a shortage of luggage covers.

Anyway, he states that the wiring harnesses were left connected, as the
wiring harnesses were provided by an aftermarket supplier and were ordered
in MY85 for three years.  Since the "afterburner" circuit was designed as
integrally bundled and couldn't be easily removed without destroying the
integrity of the entire harness, it was left in place.  Only the
annunciator, which would have indicated afterburner boost, was omitted from
the dashboard.

Now, with some age on these harnesses, and operations in extreme climates
(one suspects South Florida), the afterburner circuit has, through wear and
age, found a path way in the a/c blower motor.

However, like a lot of enthusiast publications, "Porsche:  The Unknown
Stories" does not reveal either the source of Fruelingheusen's data, nor the
untimate solution or cure for the problem.

I hope that that piece of information will enlighen those of you with
problems with blower motors.

Now, I have a new cutie for you all.  I was talking with Ralph at
Performance Plus yesterday.  He said that last Friday, during the snow, they
were working inside the shop.  There was a 928 sitting outside waiting for
service.  The 928 was in the rear, inside the high fence, and had been left
there, locked since the previous night.

Suddenly, Ralph and Paul heard a car engine start out back.  They were
startled, because, due to the snow, the gate had been left locked since the
day before, and no one had been out back.  Naturally, they raced outside to
find the 928, sitting there with its engine running and starter motor still
engaged.  They raced madly around and got the car opened and everything shut
down, but have nightmares of the 928 starting itself in the middle of the
night, and then running on, and on, and so forth....

Has anyone else had a case of "Mad Starter Motor Syndrome"?
