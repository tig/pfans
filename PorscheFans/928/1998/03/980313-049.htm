Hi Jim:

What is your VIN number?  You obviously have the computerized dash-
indicating a 1990 or newer model 928.  Is your car a US model?  Are the
rest of the computer messages in English or ?  Note the readouts can be
set for english, french, german in addition to US mph or r.o.w. kph etc.

I would gather to say that if your car is not running the OEM wheels
with the RDK sensors then naturally you are seeing the RDK warnings. Yes
there is a work around, it's not always perfect and not warrantied. 
Would like more info on your car before continuing.

Phil Tong
