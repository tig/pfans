Jim,
There are a few possibilities in your situation.

1- When however upgraded your car with GTS stuff they could have installed
the newer instrument cluster, this would case the error message since the
rest of the system is not there.

2- Someone could have updated your wheels with ones that do not have the
sensors on them.

3- System could all be there but have a problem

4- You need to try the exact tire pressure going high or low with set the
system off. Try 36 front 44 rear.

Look not only at your wheels but look for 2 matching sensors located 180
degrees apart on the spindles just inboard of your rotors.

The Type 4 you see tells you 2 things.

1- Your battery is low and this is actually the computer display rebooting.

2- It is the computer display revision. (like Windows 3,0 or 3.11, etc.)

Good Luck,

David Roberts
