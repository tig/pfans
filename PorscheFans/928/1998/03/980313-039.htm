Sounds like it could be a torque tube bearing or transmission bearing,
though I'm not sure what a hydraulic sound is. If you put the car up
on a lift, and idle it, you may find it easy to pinpoint the source
of the noise. Also you may be shocked at how loud the noise is. At 
least I was when the input bearing on my transmission failed.
