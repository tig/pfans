Regarding the posting below from Michael
Sommerville...

This is interesting.  I hope it is true.  But, when I
took physics Herr Doppler's principle worked from
the front, back or side.  Is this true, that
cop-radar can't catch me from the back?  If so,
I'll put my detector right at the front instead of
pointing both ways.  It seems odd that cop-radar
wouldn't work from behind, since Doppler works
on the basis of measurement of wave
compression due to relative difference in velocity
(meaning a cop behind me going 100 km with me
going 150 km, should be able to get a decent
Doppler reading, regardless of sign, +-).  I
suspect that the degradation of precision in radar
from behind would be related to the smaller
delta(V) rather than the direction of travel. 
Coming at you gives a larger delta(V) that allows
even the cheap junk the government buys the
police to get a reading.  

I'm mean, Doppler radar gets a pretty mean
picture, with velocity vectors, of a hurricane from
any angle you want, right?  And SAM radar never
seemed to have trouble figuring target velocity,
sadly enough; and that was top-of-the-line
Russian equipment (c.f. K-Mart & J.C. Gypney).  

Hoping I really can forget about watching my
back,

Rear detection?  Why?

 I've never understood the purpose of detecting
radar from behind, as it is impossible to be
clocked from behind or laterally using radar.
 Radar works on the Dopler shift principle, which
is a measurment of change in frequency of
microwaves reflected off of a moving target.
 However; if the radar waves and the target
vehicle are moving in the same direction, there is
a phonomenon known as Cosine Error that
prevents an acurate reading of the relative speed
of target from being calculated. Pretty much the
same when trying to clock a target moving
perpedicularly to radar emissions.
 Therefore, the only concern for low flying Shark
drivers is from radar  jockeys whom you are
APPROACHING, not moving away from.

Just some college Physics I remember, plus the
fact that I've never heard of anyone being
clocked from behind by RADAR. (All bets are off
on Laser though. This stuff works on different
physical principles)
