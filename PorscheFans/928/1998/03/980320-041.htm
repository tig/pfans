Late last year, I posted a request here for any comments on the actual costs of operating a 928 
as part of research I was doing for an article on my search for a good pre-owned example.  I 
would like to thank all of you who responded, as well as all of you who take the time to be part 
of this modern method of exchanging information about the best car Porsche ever made.  The 
article now has been published, and appears in the May issue of Excellence magazine, presently 
finding its way to subscribers or perhaps to a newsstand near you.  The article concentrates on 
the particular car I ended up purchasing, a very late model 1986S, but has some information 
which a 928 owner (or potential owner) would enjoy reading.  Together with the articles on the 
928 series in the April issue of European Car, all of a sudden there is a lot more published 
information about 928's.  By the way, I purchased the car with the great help of Shark 
afficiando and Porsche Club friend Ed Ruiz.  Yes, he's the same Ed Ruiz who is a member of this 
list and who organized the First Annual Shark Frenzy in Virginia last fall, which undoubtedly 
was the largest gathering of 928's in the East outside of a port of entry in the car's heyday.  
Luckily for me, Ed lives in my area.  He also is busy organizing the Second Shark Frenzy 
scheduled for this September, again in Virginia.  I must also add that Gene O'Rourke, also a 
member of this list, was most helpful to me with his 928 knowledge.  I am very grateful to have 
such friends.
