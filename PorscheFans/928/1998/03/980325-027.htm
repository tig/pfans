Mark,

Thanks for the input.  I've been trying to decide between 518 and 599.  
I guess either one would work.  The Loctite tech rep told me to use 599.  
I think that 599 will withstand higher temp, and  it's cheap, about $5 
at my local NAPA (not that that's any reason to use it).

The trouble with using anything WITH the stock cork gasket (IMHO), is 
that I think the gasket shrinks over time, which causes the bolts to 
become loose.  Maybe when the engine heats up and expands it compresses 
the gasket and when it cools down again it starts to leak (after a 
period of time, and many, many cycles of heating/cooling).  But then, 
what do I know, I'm a photographer not an engineer...
