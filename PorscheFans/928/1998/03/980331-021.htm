The corner trim piece is mounted with two spring nut from the back.  You practically have
to destroy it in order to remove it.  Be prepared to pay about $35 each for them.  On the
upper trim piece, I took a piece of oak stock about the size of 6x1x2.  I beveled one end
90 degree and place it between the trim and door.  Tap gently with a rubber mallet along
the trim piece.  It should come off very easily.  On the lower piece, I pried it out from
the back, along the length of the trim piece.  Use a thin-bodied pry bar, with light
tapping on the hanging end of the pry bar.  Position the pry bar so that the inner door
panel acts as the fulcrum.
