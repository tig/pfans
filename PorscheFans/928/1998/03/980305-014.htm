I'm with you, Pat...I've swapped out the standard rubber lines for
braided steel
on all motorcycles, street and race, and the difference in braking is
night
and day.  In the brake lever, you can feel the mushiness of the
expanding
rubber brake lines distinctly, even when the lines are new....on an
older
bike, it's even more dramatic.  Some motorcycle folks opt for Kevlar
lines
as an alternative to braided steel, mostly for the pretty colors they
come in,
as far as I can tell....but again, the line diameter doesn't expand
under
pressure like the rubber lines.

Can somebody tell us all why the same isn't true for cars?  Or is that
the
same IS true for cars, but for reason X, the SS lines are more prone to
failure than the rubber ones?
