I was planning on having the belt and water pump replaced in the very near
future.  Can any tell me where i should buy the belt and pump from and what i
can expect to pay on them and how much i can expect to pay on installation.

I have an 89s4 with 33,000 miles.  Should i do anything else as a preventive
measure while it is apart?  I don't have much history on vehicle service but
the car looks and runs great.

Does it take everyone else almost an hour to go through the entire postings?
I'm slowing losing my girlfriend because of the attention i pay to my car and
the time on the list......
