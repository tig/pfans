Phil,

Many thanks for your replies, I'll have to enquire at Porsche about the =
'contact bridge 9293', or get see if any of my local specialists can =
assist.

I made an enquiry with a local Porsche specialist, who has disabled Cats =
from other peoples cars, by removing the pipe from the car, then I think =
he opens up the cat covers somehow to remove the catalyst, then welds =
the covers back on. He quoted 120 GBpounds (just under 200 dollars).

I am note sure what you mean by "a test pipe"?
"replete with O2 sensor fitting" does this mean the sensor hole is =
already filled?
and who is/are "Bursch"?  a UK specialist perhaps?
"the airpump fitting" what is this?

Thanks again for your wisdom, and for the benefit of your manuals.
I've enjoyed browsing your website, especially the pics.

Small comment here, I read the information on Chassis numbers with =
interest and when I asked Porsche about mine "WPOzzz92zKS840210" they =
said the 4 after the 8 means coupe.

Regards

Nigel Hooker.

Either that or you need to figure out which leads to bridge on the
diagnosis socket.  DIY here can definately screw the car up and not
recommended. =20

But the entire procedure couldn't take more than 10 seconds with that
9293 tool - are you friends with your dealer?  Maybe at the next oil
change or whatever you can get them to 'fix' your dash gratis.

Available languages are German, English, French and Italian (not Spanish
as I had previously thought).

Good luck!

Yikes.  I would stay away from handling / breathing anything inside the
coverter.  I would gather to say your choices are:

1. cat replacement with new / used

2. put in a 'test pipe', replete with O2 sensor fitting.  Doesn't Bursch
still offer this?  If not should be easy to weld up.  Let the airpump
fitting just vent to atmosphere.  Don't forget the H-pipe / crossover
balance tube to save your low-mid range torque.  Should also reduce the
'drumming' sound of non-crossed over dual exhausts. =20

I used the Y-pipe bypass on the 16v 928 and it definately improved
performance.  Very noticeable decline in power (and decibels) when I had
to put the cat back on. =20

Back later, hope I can find the manual sections on dash languages...
Phil
