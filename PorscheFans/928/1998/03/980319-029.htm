Since there was a request for driving stories, here is one I posted a while
ago
on the 911 list:

To all,
Just got into the office after racing two Lotus Esprit Turbo's (looked like
the S4 or Sport 300 Series). In any case they passed me on the highway
doing about 200 km/h (sorry about lack of mph conversion), so I caught up
fairly easily. By the time I was breathing in their neck, the guys must
have dropped a cog or two, because we started approaching "your license is
definetely gone" speeds. (not that 200 kmh would get you a nice smile from
a cop)
This took about 10 km or so, and I couldn't pass the guys. Then we drove
into the city (Luxembourg) which has fairly intricate streets with 2 lanes
on each side for the ones we drove. This was like driving in a video game,
absolutely unreal. I mean here we were the three of us powering through
traffic with people either thinking we were crazy or actually having fun
watching this. Anyhow we literally crossed the city racing (by then I had
managed to squeeze into second after a start at a light and finally into
first after taking advantage of a tactical positioning error from one of
the contenders :-). Anyways I finally stopped for gas, and the guys waved
and kept going. So here I am in the office, with a big grin on my face and
since nobody was around for me to share this, I just thought that I would
share it with you.
Obviously I do not encourage reckless driving nor disrespecting the limits
etc..etc.. :) oh, and by the way my 930 is for sale.
Cheers
Gerard Lopez
