There should be no bodywork required for this. When I restored my 78
Euro, I removed the S model spoiler that the PO had put on the car.
Actually, he had replaced the whole rear hatch with one from a later car
- why, I'm not sure. Anyway, The difference is in the exterior window
trim.

If your car now has the spoiler, you will have two small L-shaped trim
pieces that fit across the top of the window, meeting with a joiner in
the middle, and curve part way down the sides of the glass. Cars without
the spoiler have three pieces of exterior window trim - two larger
L-shaped pieces that replace the small ones you have, and a single one
that covers the lower part of the window and curves up to meet the two
side/top pieces. This is the piece that has the nice, tasteful (as
Leonard Laub states, although I haven't confirmed this by licking just
yet) 928 embossing. There are also three trim joiners required.

Remove the spoiler (the screws and nuts that hold it in place are
exposed by removing the interior hatch trim), and remove the upper metal
trim. Note the the black plastic retainers underneath the trim.  When
you get the new trim pieces you need, make sure you get enough of these
trim retainers, and screws, to retain the new trim. The originals also
had little rubber washers under the screw heads, although I suggest you
add a little silicone as well. It's all pretty straight-forward.

The side pieces of the spoiler do attach to the directly to the body
through holes that are not there in an "unspoiled" car. Fortunately,
with the exception of one (on each side), they are hidden by the side
window trim. The two that you can see are on the inner edge of the hatch
opening. You can't see these when the hatch is closed. I'm sure you
could get a small, flat plastic decorative plug of some sort to hide the
hole. Or just put the screw back in after you remove the spoiler ends.
I'm a little unclear as to how these attach, since my car did not have
them. I did obtain them, and the two flared trim pieces required to
mount them, with the intent of completing my spoiler, but decided to put
the car back to its original look instead.
