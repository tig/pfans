Daniel,

I thought that I had saved a whole bunch of posts on the "Magic Blower
Syndrome" from other members of the list, but I guess I deleted  most of
them as my email files began to bulge.  If you've been receiving this list
for the last few months, you would see by going back through them, that
quite a few guys, including Porsche mechanics like yourself, haven't been
able to find a simple solution to this, including replacing the resistor
pack etc. 

I'm not saying that your wrong by any means, because even though I've been
addicted to driving Porsches in general, and 928s in particular, for many
years, I'm not really a mechanic and don't have the time, tools, energy,
desire, or expertise to attempt fixing  these things myself. 

Maybe you can solve this problem.  Without the kidding I did in my earlier
post about guys buying you a Boxster, I know that there are quite a few
members of the list who would dearly love to have an answer to this
problem, and directions for a fix that really works.

Thanks again for your interest and offer to share your knowledge.

Gene
