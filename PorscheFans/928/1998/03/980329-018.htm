>Quote from NER web page:

	Zone 1 Regions require a 2.5lb charge (minimum) class BC or
	ABC fire extinguisher at Driver Education Events. They must be
	held by a metal bracket (no plastic straps or brackets) and
	must be secured by at least 2 bolts and nuts. No sheet metal
	or self-tapping screws are allowed. It must be secured to a
	metal mounting point (chassis, seat rail, roll cage, etc.) and
	be reachable from the driver's seat. Some fire extinguishers
	come with plastic nozzles. These are unreliable and can break
	off easily. They are not recommended.<


I don't know if this applies to other Zone 1 Regions, but at CVR (Connecticut
Valley), FEs are only required in the top 2 (or is it 3?) run groups.  And
since you don't require an instructor to ride with you in those groups, you
could remove your passenger seat for the event and fabricate a bracket that
would attach to the seat rails.  Not the most desirable solution, but better
than ripping apart your car to get to metal.
