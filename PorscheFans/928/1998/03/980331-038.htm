It seems to me that the Corvette is and has been fibreglass 
bodied...COMPLETELY...for quite some time.

Possibly you have to formulate the paint differently for
FG (as you do for PU, btw!), but I can't see how this could
be a showstopper....

I have great respect for Alois Ruf's engines, but this sounds
like a....er, profit center.
