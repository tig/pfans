	He wasn't wrong.  When my wife and I were over there in July/Aug last
year, we drove from London up to Skye, and we were in Scotland before I saw a
speed limit posted on the motorways, and traffic broke down into three broad
categories: Caravans lumbering along as best they could, another clump of folks
doing 70-75 and a large number (40-30%) doing 85-100.  The M1 south on the
return trip was the same (the first trip we took the western route, past
Carlisle, Birmingham and Oxford.)

	The speeds were a lot more regular on the one lane roads we spent a lot
of time on in Scotland... :-)
