What a 928 is worth to me is a very personal to issue.  I spent 2 years
searching for mine and would have paid up to 12K for it.  Keep in mind it's
a '78.  My criteria included one owner, a serial number less than car 1000
(also implying 77 or 78, the first year model), the right color combination,
less than 50K and it had to be in nearly perfect condition.  After a long
search I found everything I wanted and paid only 8K.  Most think this is
still high but the car is all original, number 637, had 38K, and was as
perfect as one can realistically expect.  The original owner drove it once a
week to and from the tennis club.  He never drove it in the rain.  It was
always garage parked and his pride and joy.  He respected the car as much as
I do and actually interviewed me before selling it.  This also impressed me.
He was offered 8k by several other parties but turned them away.  So to me
this car was a bargain.  I was not leaving without the car that day and
would have paid 4K more for it.  I think he respected my love for the first
year 928 and rightfully believed I would take good care of the car.  Today
it would take an unrealistic offer for me to consider selling it.  I'm
convinced it cannot be replaced.  If it can then I need two first year
models.

BTW, at the time I bought it I planned to put a maximum of 3K on the car per
year.  I've already put 7K on it this first year.  It is simply a joy to
drive.  I had planned to store it before I reach 50K and buy an 89 S4.  Now
I'll wait until I have a suitable replacement and then decide to store it or
not.  I can't really imagine not driving a 928 at least once a week.  The S4
will definitely be an everyday driver and one I won't feel bad about taking
to Devek for a few modifications.  What's the S4 worth to me?  I won't know
until I'm looking at it.  So forget about the KBB and other price points.
For some of us, these beauties are simply worth what we are ready to pay the
day we see the 928 which we just can't let pass by.
