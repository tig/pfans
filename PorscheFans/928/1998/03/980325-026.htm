Not a marketing stunt!  Originally designed purely to prevent corrosion
in racing cooling systems (where glycol coolants are not allowed, and
in fact REDUCE the cooling ability of water).

Benefits, in short:  water pump lube, corrosion inhibitor, better
cooling.

The better cooling is only important if you're running hot...928s seem=20
to run pretty cool in general.

A snippet from the Water Wetter tech info, from Red Line's site:

Red Line SuperCool with Water Wetter can reduce cooling system
temperatures compared to glycol solutions and even plain water. Water
has excellent heat transfer properties in its liquid state, but very
high surface tension makes it difficult to release water vapor from the
metal surface. Under heavy load conditions, much of the heat in the
cylinder head is transferred by localized boiling at hot spots, even
though the bulk of the cooling solution is below the boiling point. Red
Line's unique SuperCool reduces the surface tension of water by a =
factor
of two, which means that much smaller vapor bubbles will be formed.
Vapor bubbles on the metal surface create an insulating layer which
impedes heat transfer. Releasing these vapor bubbles from the metal
surface can improve the heat transfer properties in this localized
boiling region by as much as 15% as shown in Figure 2. This figure
demonstrates the removal of heat from an aluminum bar at 304=B0F by
quenching the bar in different coolants at 214=B0F under 15 psi =
pressure.
Compare the time required to reduce the temperature of the aluminum to
250=B0F, or the boiling point of water at 15 psi. SuperCool required =
3.2
seconds, water alone 3.7 sec, 50/50 glycol in water required 10.2 sec,
and 100% glycol required 21 sec. Water alone required 15% longer, 50/50
glycol 220% longer, and 100% glycol required 550% longer.=20

>>OK,  so I'm going through the DEVEK website and I'm reading the
section on
> coolant and they suggest we go to the long life antifreeze (5 yr
> change
> interval) and also to use distilled water and water wetter. =20
>=20
I question the need for distilled water (except for topping up
batteries), as long
as you have SOME coolant in the mix.
