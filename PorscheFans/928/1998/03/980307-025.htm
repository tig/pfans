Hi Guys 

(any Gals out there do their own work? If you do, I'm single
BTW!)

 Picked my car up on Thurs, put it in the shop for complete
paint/engine/interior detailing. Here are my current problems
I've discovered in my one day of possesion:

1. Moderate oil leak, quarter size spot after one night in the gar.
   [I'll track this down after the engine detail]

2. ABS light/warning after hitting a small pothole (not a speed bump)
   I think on the right side front.
   [anyone seen this before?]

3. It appears that the windshield washer lines are busted off
   (the ones on the right hand under side of the hood).
   [what's it like to replace these?]

4. The mats are dirty/worn beyond acceptable, I'd love to find 
   some with a nice emblem rather than the PORSCHE name only.
   Any suggestions? I'd like black, even though the org is tan.

The car has 140K, but you would'nt know it from looks or drive. 
This was the PO's third one, his second is still in town and has
280K on it!
