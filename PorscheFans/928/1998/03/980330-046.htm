>>Also what oil -- I've been using 5W50 Syntec. Thanks for the

Two comments:

1.	Use a narrow range oil instead.  The broad-range oils require
the
	addition of multi-grade viscosity enhancers, which tend to be 
	a bit unstable, and break down fairly early in your oil's life
span.
	Note that this applies to synthetics as well as petroleums,
although
	synthetics tend to have more of a multigrade character in that
	they're fairly insensitive to temperature, so fewer additives
are needed
	to qualify for the wide multigrade rating.

2.	Syntec will leave deposits in your engine.  Apparently this is
by
	design, but I've been unable to find anyone who's gotten a good 
	reason for this out of Castrol.

Oil recommendations:

3 very good oils out there:

Amsoil:  supposed to be a very good oil (new formulation, anyway), may
be difficult to find.

Mobil 1:  very good oil, easily available, relatively inexpensive
(around $5
per quart).

Red Line: excellent oil, 25% less friction than Mobil 1 of a similar
grade.
Allows you to extend your drain intervals to as high as 25000 miles (I
don't go beyond 12,000 myself, but I'm neurotic).  Doesn't break down
by about 5000-7000 miles like most other synthetics.  More expensive
than Mobil 1 (about $8 per quart...see me if you're paying more than
that!), good for a percent or two more horsepower over Mobil 1.  Less
easily available than Mobil 1--call 800-624-7958 for a dealer (or talk
to
me...I'll drop ship).

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

If you switch from a petro oil to any of the good synthetics, you'll
feel
a noticeable difference in the engine, esp. warming up, and throttle
response.

Between the top oils, the only way you're going to tell the difference
is:

 - tear down the engine after 100K miles and measure parts wear
 - carefully measure your fuel economy under identical driving
   conditions (the differences are going to be very slight, like 1-3%)
 - measure your horsepower on a dyno*

*HOT engine only...a warm or cold engine's friction is dependent
more on the viscosity here--no metal-to-metal contact, no stress
tearing apart the sheet film.
