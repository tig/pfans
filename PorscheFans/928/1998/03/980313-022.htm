Dave 86 928S 5spd,

Are you really asking about the procedure to remove
the bumper? Or are you wanting to remove just the
cover?

Well, if you want to remove the bumper, then you'll
have to first remove the cover. I'll tell you what I
know about *that* :

 Remove the parking lamp retaining rings first. Remove
 the grill in front of the radiator opening. Remove
 the bottom splash pans that attach to the cover.
 Remove the trim that masks the boarder between the
 front soffet (the area where the hood release is
 mounted) and the top-most edge of the bumper cover.
 The cover is held on by many small 8mm nuts that are
 found along the boarder of the inside of the front
 fenders. This boarder is the lip of the fender which
 is on the same plane as the front of the car. To
 access these nuts, you'll have to remove the front
 fender inner fender splash guards. This is done by
 removing 3 or 4 10mm bolts (very obvious). Beware
 that the drivers side should have the alternator
 cooling duct and exterior AC air sensor attached. The
 passenger's side has nothing attached to the splash
 guard, but the car's horns may be in the way. Find the
 cover's nuts. The studs are part of the cover itself.
 One tricky nut is located very close to the point
 where the hood meets the front fender (when shut).
 Headlights may need to be moved into the "on" or
 upright postition to get to all of the nuts. These
 nuts may all be corroded to the point of breaking
 the studs as you fight to back them out. Once all
 of the nuts are off of all of the studs, you can
 pull the cover forward and off of the car.

At this point, the BUMPER will be exposed. Did you
really want to remove this as well?

Oh yeah...you WILL lose knuckle flesh throught this
procedure.
