Time for me to open mouth insert foot. I talked to my information source. He's an electronics engineer that sells parts to these companies. The items described above are being developed.

The new radars compensate for that. Simple trig with an old radar will also work for angles.

Wrong. Perpendicular, there isn't any change in speed.

Approaching is actually a bigger problem, because you never go head on at them. Therefore they have to calculate the angle of approach.

You are now hearing from one.

If a cop shoots you with laser while he's moving, he's waiting to die. Laser guns require precise aiming. He'd be holding the gun right up to his eye. Try accurately shooting a gun while looking through the sight and driving.

Already done that but now Maryland has started using confiscated cars as unmarked. Fairfax, VA. is trying to get a Corvette to entrap speeders with.

I toasted one of those tonight with my little I4 that could.

1 - empty space for 928
2 - roadkills tonight (damn I can't wait to get something with actual power)
