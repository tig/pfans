Uh......Leonard........your (X)manical side is showing!

FWIW, I had to repair my fuel tank sending unit.    It's easy to check
the system by accessing the sender under the large, black plastic hole
cover on the starboard (RH) side of the hatch area under the carpet and
sound insulation.

After removing the cover, you can check the condition (continuity,
oxidation, etc) of the square three-pin electrical connector on the top
of the sender.    While in there, use large channel locks to loosen the
black threaded ring that holds the sender in place.   You'll have to
remove the fuel return line, but after removing the sender, it will be
easy to reconnect electrically and manually tilt the sender.   By doing
this, you can approximate the position of the level disk inside the tube
and duplicate various fuel levels inside the tank.  I was able to do
this while keeping my eye on the fuel guage.   If you have trouble,
don't be afraid to take a 3mm (as I remember) socket to take the sender
tube apart and see the guts and access the plastic disk that slides up
and down the central tube rod.   This sliding action moves the
electrical connection up and down a fine wire (easily seen) which
changes the resistance value transmitted to your fuel guage.  In this
way, you will definitely determine which element of the fuel sending
circuit is at fault - or if in fact (per Leonard), there is a problem in
the ability of the tank to hold and accept fuel.

Good luck!
