It is my opinion that lubing the threads AND taper
creates a more accurate torque during the assembly
process.

When the lug starts to bottom out, the sticktion
between the two aluminum faces creates a notchy, uneven
feel to the torquing process.

When reading repair manuals - in order to torque
cylinder heads, the torque specs are usually stated to
apply towards lightly lubricated fittings.  This is in
order to obtain accurate torques.  Otherwise, I think,
the nuts probably won't be tight enough as the
sticktion will stop them from getting that extra bit
tighter.

Also, I don't think galvanitic corrosion should enter
into the equation if the wheels are removed once in a
while as they are for routine maintenance.
