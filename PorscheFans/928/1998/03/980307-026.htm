    Open the hood and look at the plastic cover over the wippers
mechanism.  Actually,the cover is hidding the wiper mechanism and the
heater blower.  It might be out of place
or, even worse, in pieces.  When the wipper mechanism goes by, it rubs
on the cover and
makes an awful noise...  But it could be something more complicated...
