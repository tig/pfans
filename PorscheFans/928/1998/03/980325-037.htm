 I have a '81 that
refuses to allow operation of the power mirrors. I originally could only
get the left and right function to work on the driver side and elevation on
the passenger. Thinking in the simplest of terms I ordered two new switches
as they were under $10 each thinking this would solve everything. NOT so, I
now have NO control at all and do not even have power at the fuse ??? I
have racked my brain over the electrical diagram I have on microfiche and
can't make heads or tails of it. If anyone has a suggestion PLEASE let me
know.............

I have not seen a reply to this one, and am interested myself, as the '81 928 I
am about to take delivery of has non functioning electric mirrors, though I
think I could a relay click on left/right movement of the joystick.
