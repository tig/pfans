Marc:
Thanks for the input.  I talked to a respected mechanic in town and he =
said the same (throw out bearing).  He did say that nothing would happen =
to damage the car, it would get louder though.  I wish i knew what your =
friend did the second time around.  I will see if my warranty covers the =
work and may take it in.

Thanks,

Hi Mike:

Just about a month ago I was hearing a noise that went away when the
clutch pedal was being depressed (even slightly).  This told me that the
"throw-out bearing" or clutch release lever bearing was shooting craps.

I was kinda bummed out at the idea of replacing this as I knew if we go,
we go all the way.  Meaning clutch, bearing, resurfacing the flywheel,
etc. I was checking out the GTS upgrade for my 88 5-speed. =20

But no!  My friend and trusted mechanic inspected it and verified that
the clutch had plenty of surface so he tried to lube the bearing (or
whatever was making the steenking noise).  It worked for about two or
three weeks and started to slightly whine again, sometimes louder than
others.  I told him about it and he took it in and spent some time on
it, sorry, I didn't watch, and it has been fine for many months now.

I guess he helped me dodge the clutch bullet for now.  I hope this works
for you.  The scary thing is that I was ready to do the whole clutch
deal (because I love the cars and have so much respect for them, etc.)
and if my pal wouldn't have screwed around with it and solved my problem
I could have subjected my shark and my wallet to unnecessary surgery!
