Re: the remarks on torqueing lug nuts by John Webber and others.  I'll
relate something that I'm sure is common knowledge to thos of you who have
had 928s for some time but might be helpful to some ot those on the list
who have recently bought them.  Five or six years ago I came across, quite
by accident a beautiful 86s 5speed with 39k miles that had always been
garaged and looked brand new except for the tires which were the original
factory tires and were almost treadless. I bought it for a song because the
owner and his wife had their third rugrat on the way and had just purchased
a Jeep Grand Wagoneer.  I already had three 928s and needed another one
like a canary needs moose antlers, but this car was so exceptional that I
figured I'd buy it and sell it to someone who was looking for really nice car.

I didn't want to spend $800.00 for a new set of tires, so took it to a
place I knew  that sold used tires, mostly Fuldas that they bought by the
container load from Germany where you must have, as I recall, at least 80%
of the original tread on your tires.  So they get a lot of  good rubber.  I
paid $200.00 for a set that looked almost new.

Then instead of selling the car, I liked it so much that I kept it for
almost a year and put some mileage on it.  I ran over a drill bit one day
and blew one of the rears, so took it to my local guy and told him to put
two new ones on the back.

He informed me the next day that his guys couldn't get the wheels off the
car.  As most of you know, the lug nuts are supposed to be torqued on to
(going by memory) 92 pounds of pressure.  Turned out that the clowns at the
used tire place must have used a three foot long breaker bar to tighten the
lugs, as they had  been tightened to over 250 pounds of  pressure, and had
literally fused themselves onto the lugs.  They tried everything short of a
nuclear device to get them off and finally had to drill all twenty lugs out
and replace them and the nuts at a cost of almost $600.00.  

I took their invoice and collected the entire amount from the used tire
dealer.  A process that involved much gentle persuasion in several
different languages at an extremely high decibel level.  Not a warning
against buying used tires, just a reminder that when you buy new tires for
your shark, make damned sure that the installers are aware of the fact the
they're tightening aluminum nuts against aluminum wheels containing steel
studs. You old time owners correct me on the pressure if I'm wrong because
my owner's manual is in the car which is having a split steering fluid hose
replaced.  Not bad though.  First time the car has been in the shop in
almost two weeks.
