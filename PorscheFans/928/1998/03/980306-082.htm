I too have been shocked at some of the prices some dealers are getting.  I
looked at an 89S4,auto, a champaine color, 42k miles, all the right goodies.
Asking price...hold on $26,400...now this dealer has had this car on his lot
for at least the last year...he ssaid that he would let it go for $24K.  To me
this seems a little excessive.  I figure he has had it for awhile so I am
going to look around more.

<<Hey all,
I have some good and bad news.  It seems that prices are coming back up
on 928's!  After these last two deals I do with my silver 87 and a black
87 for Moira I don't think I'll beable to get really nice cars for what
I've been buying them for.  Prices for 87-89's are moving up into the
$18, $19, and $20K range.  Believe it or not!
