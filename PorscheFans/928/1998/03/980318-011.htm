YEEE HAWWW!!!

Last night, I got my '88 S4 halfshafts installed into my 
'89 GT wheel carriers and '79 tranny. These halfshafts were
the last link to the BIG BRAKE upgrade, which is now done.
The '90 GT rear coilovers are now in the rear, too. 

I fired the car up and even though it hadn't been started
in 16 days, it JuMpEd to life in an instant. Warmed it up,
backed out to the end of the driveway, put it in first,
headed back into the driveway and hit the brakes for a quick
test. The car stopped immediately as expected. I backed out
again and headed out of the neighborhood towards my "test"
track; Chrystal Falls Golf Course Rd. I got up to about 40
mph and then braked to a stop at a typical traffic stopping
pressure. Stops quite well. No pulling. I continued the test
drive, turning around in the golf course parkinglot and
started to head back. Every stop so far indicates the brakes
work fantastically! 

Comming out of the golf course parkinglot one must start
from a stop sign and climb a moderate, yet very rough grade.
As I was accelerating up the hill, I shifted into second and
applied a bit of gas to get the rear wheels to *just* start 
to break loose (I have WAY too much power at my command!)
and right when they hit the spin point, there was a muffled
thud from the rear of the car. The car's "attitude" had
changed. The rear felt wobbly. Ooops. What'd I do? 

I nursed it back to the house and crawled under to take a
look. Everything was still attached and looked to be in order...
except for one of the rear camber eccentrics. The passenger's
side, lower control arm to cross-member eccentric had flipped
over! The "teardrop" portion was upside-down and out of the
"pocket". Well... [say that like The Church Lady] Well...
I didn't torque *that* down. No damage, thank goodness. Yes, now
I remember that I'd defferred completely torquing ANY of the toe
or camber adjusters in the rear as I had no idea of how to get
that into the ballpark yet.

One thing about the brakes, though. Even though I can stop on
a dime now, I was really expecting a much firmer _feel_ to the
pedal. It still feels a tad soft to me. I don't know what the
big Brembo brakes *should* feel like. ANYONE out there care to
give me their assessment? Like, does your S4 / GT lock 'em up
with the pressure of a baby's pinky? Or do you have a wide range
of what I'd call "modulation"; locking 'em up requires a deliberate,
large pedal travel, leg-press extension?

I _may_ be experiencing the feel of a leaky booster, eh? Like, no
help from that unit?

BTW - (bragging mode on) The entire swap took me 6 hours. 3 hours
      for the front and 3 hours for the rear. Yes, I know that
      some of the more experienced 928'ers can pull off an entire
      suspension/brake swap in less time, but hey! This was my
      first.
      (I think I'll leave the bragging mode on ;-)

TIA,
