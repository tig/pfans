I would be interested in exploring options for upgraded performance
for my '82 that did NOT involve serious engine work and associated
costs.  i.e. moderate performance enhancement at moderate cost.

I have been told that the early cars can obtain a substantial
performance
increase with headers and exact indexing of the cams through the use of
adjustable cam gears.  The person who gave me that info stated that
such gears used to be available, were commonly used in past years along
with headers such as Devek currently sells to obtain HP increases of up
to 20% at the rear wheels for the early cars without the necessity of
changing to euro heads or cams.  The comment was made that the
change to adjustable cam gears and correct indexing could really make
the 16v engine come alive because without the fine tuning available with

the adjustable cam gear, one bank's cam timing could easily be as much
as 3 degrees out of phase with the other bank.

Does Devek have any experience with adjustable cam gears, knowledge
of availability and/or comments on the above assertion?  I'll try to
find
the source of the adjustable gears.

But, I wonder if that is really necessary.
That is, isn't there adequate adjustment via tensioners, guides etc to
ensure
accurate indexing of the cams via the stock factory settup?
