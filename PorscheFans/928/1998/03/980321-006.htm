1. Is there any way to repair or replace this plastic cap? and would one want
to?

Competent shop could do it, but why not go for a complete un-molested  unit?

2. It seems the going price for a new radiator is $ 750.00, has anyone see a
better  price?

I bought a used one from an '87 for $200 from an advertiser in Hemmings.

3. Perhaps even more important than the price, I understand there are better
radiators available than the factory units, and if this is the case who sells
such an item, and what does it cost?

IMO, get a used one and have it checked out at a good radiator shop.   It has all the appropriate
Porsche stickers and was designed for your car.   At 'pre-tested' prices, you could put two in the
car and still be less total cost than a new one.   On the other hand, if you autocross, race, or
whatever, you might want to consider an aftermarket design.

Good luck!
