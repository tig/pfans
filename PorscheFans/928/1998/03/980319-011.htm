Dave,
There are 2 ways to do it (that I know of) :
#1 pull the engine out, rest is simple

#2 (the way I did it) "Non-Detailed Description":
Step 1 - Support front of car on suitable jack stands etc.
Step 2- Remove front tires, unbolt lower control arms and let hang
Step 3 - unbolt power steering rack from crossmember (also unbolt steering
arm u-joint at rack) and let hang.
Step 4 - Support Engine at center of oil pan with soft block of wood and
floor jack,
raise up on jack till front of car starts to lift slightly (enough to
"unload" the weight on the mounts)
Step 5 - unbolt lower motor mount nuts from crossmenber
Step 6 - unbolt main crossmember from chassis, crossmember should now drop
down and be free enough to get the mounts out. (watch out for your head,...
just kidding)
Step 7 - unbolt upper motor mount brackets from engine, remove complete
mount and upper mount bracket as assembly .

Reverse the process installing the new mounts.

Since you will be loosening suspension components I suggest having your
alignment checked afterwards.

This is the basic procedure without going into all of the little details,
removing shields, etc.

It took me almost a full day to do it this first time because I was trying
to find some shortcuts (failed miserably), should take less from now on.

This was the single most satisfying repair with drastic results that I have
ever done to a 928 (and I
have done a lot).

Makes a  major difference in the feel and perception of the car.

Also as usual the dread was much worse than the actual process, ( I
originally
bought these motor mounts for my long since gone 84 about 5 years ago, but
never got up the energy to install them)

I am ordering a new pair for my 89 S4 tomorrow and will do it next weekend
and will never put off this process again.

List cost from Porsche is $295.98 each, my best cost with PCA discount at
dealership is $249.01 each

MY 83-95 part# 928.375.039.00

P.S. - 79 long gone to Wisconsin in hands of new 928 Fan Tom Knebes (you
know the guy with ALL CAPS, wanting to know everything about 928s so as to
keep from buying the manuals, BTW, HE WAS JUST KIDDING)
