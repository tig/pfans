(Brian Buxton wrote) 1. Turtle Wax bug & tar remover-gets off all
oxidation and bugs/tar/etc.  Do entire car 1X per year.
  Yes Zymol is expensive, but it is the best.  Yes it requires some
sweat and elbow grease to do all of the above, but aren't our Porsches
worth it?  No, I have no stock in Zymol wax and I do not distribute it
-just
a very satisfied customer.

Brian Buxton (the waxing fool who is staunchly against buffers)

Larry Reynolds (who runs Car Care Specialties 201-796-8300, look for his
ad in Panorama) makes the same recommendations as John Paterek, Porsche
Club authority on paint/detailing.  I just got off the phone with him
and he said Turtle Wax Bug & Tar remover is a solvent made of Kerosine
and will give a temporary shine as it damages and removes paint.  It
should only be used on isolated spots for removing tar/bugs and then
immediately washed off.  Larry has personally tested every such product
out there on his own cars, you ought to see the list of the 100's of
products he sells and I'm pretty sure he knows his stuff.  He also said
Zymol wax lasts about a third as long as Blitz Wax (which is much
cheaper) with very similar depth of shine, and that P21S wax will give a
better shine than Zymol, also cheaper and more durable.  John Paterek
personally recommended to me to use 3M Imperial Hand Glaze and Blitz wax
for best results.  

I'm not saying this for the point of shooting you down, I would just
hate for anyone to damage their paint or even pay more than they have
to.  Larry Reynolds and John Paterek have been great resources for club
members.  You can see the results of their advice each year at Parade.
