Greets,

My 84 finally decided to become kaput last night.  When trying to start
the car, I get a similar sound to one that is produced when the starter
is actuated AFTER the motor is already running.  Very loud and very
nasty.  This has happened before but it always ended up starting
correctly on the next try.  My mechanic thinks that the gear teeth on
the flywheel are starting to chip off which is causing flat spots along
the geared edges of the wheel.  It sounds like that is the case OR it is
actually the starter.

Has anyone ever seen something like this before?  Also, anyone know of a
good Porsche shop in Nashville BESIDES Bloodworth?  Last time I went to
them, they added a 2k margin for the exact work another mechanic did
for  under $600.   


Thanks.

Kevin
