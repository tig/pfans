Hello,
Here's an update on the GTS Clutch Upgrade.......still waiting for parts from
Devek.
Should be here about next Thursday. I got the old clutch assembly out with no
problems.
The pilot bearing was another story. Tried to hook it from behind and tap it
out, but had no luck budging it, then had a brainfart after thinking about
Kurt's recommendations for a puller. 
(I'm a Tool and Die Maker, but have no access to my own lathe, and it's a
stict no-no to do personal stuff at work....speaking of which, I go for an
exam next week to hopefully be able to return after about 10 months off for my
operation.....apologies for the side-bar) 
So, after the brainfart, I went to the hardware store and bought a 4"x1/2"
concrete floor anchor bolt and used it as an internal expanding
puller.....Worked great!
I also removed the flywheel, (after getting a 12mm / 12 point wrench bit) and
stoned the slightly blue-marked and scuffed clutch surface till it looked
fine. I was initially trying to avoid the prospect of someone screwing it up,
by cutting it too much or with a lateral run-out on some junk machine, but
later decided to go on and have it blanchard ground at a Lexington clutch and
joint service. They removed .006" and I feel better about doing the upgrade
knowing the flywheel is absolutely true.
I also removed the rear main seal as it will be replaced too. 
It should be mentioned that when doing the Upgrade, only one shim instead of
the current two, is used between the release bearing and the clutch pressure
plate spring. Thanks to Angel Paredes for cluing me in on this and sending me
the fax to show it, and also to Marc Thomas for the advice. 

After the upgrade is done, I'll finish the items that started this whole
thing. (well the shift cup / coupler thing is done) ...... (oxygen sensor,
ignition wires, caps, rotors sitting in box on kitchen floor)  
Then after this is done, I'm going to time my camshafts per the manuals, (see
15-132) except I'm going to be using the setting of 15 degrees ATDC instead of
the recommended 20 degrees ATDC........ (I'd brought this subject up before as
one of Devek's tech tips....has anyone done this?)
Speaking to Marc about this......shouldn't be to difficult......

Also, after months of deliberation, I talked to Susan and Marc at Devek about
ordering the 2-piece / 5 spoke Forgeline 17"x9.5" and 17"x11" wheels with the
255x45 and 285x40 tires. I'm going to get them with the polished outer rims
and car-color anodized centers.
I will be de-wiessaching the rear suspension as he recommends for this rear
tire setup. He'll fax me the procedure and give me tech advice for this also.
Should be easy to do and is easily reversible.
