Spring is HERE!  Roger Woodbury - time to come out of hibernation!
Drove the Shark. Used the new floor jack.  Washed the Shark's belly.
Drove the Shark. Washed the Shark.  Drove the Shark. (Do we see a
pattern here?) God! What a great day!  I feel so good I want to reply
to every post on the list...

I'm giddy!  <smack>

Ok. I feel better now.  How about just a few? :)

I've gotten 20 MPG on road-trips.  I generally get about 14 MPG on
mixed driving. Yes, I DO have a serious limp because of the 55 pound
weight in my right boot :)

Does Mark use the list to determine what's on sale? Hell, it's a great
idea!  He certainly had hatch covers for those in need!  Great work
Mark.

I wonder what would happen if we all started writing about really
needing the 6 liter kit from Devek? Would they follow Mark's lead and
put it on sale?

Congratulations, Moira.  Have fun.

Likely, your next road kill will be two hoons (transplanted from NZ) in
a mustang trying to impress the girl in the Porsche... :)

When washing Das Beast today I washed the front with the head lamps in
the up position to wash away 7 years of dirt.  After drying I
retracted the head lamps only find many drops of water in front of the
lamps.

Tears.

I know why now.
