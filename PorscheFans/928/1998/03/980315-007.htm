Hi Melanie:

Thank you for the nice message.  I enjoy hearing from 928 owners all
over the world!   The 928 is enjoying media coverage again this year, on
it's 21st Anniversary, which makes us all proud.  I'm glad to able to do
what I can for this noble car.

I'd be glad to honor your old car as well if you'd like to send me any
photos.  I'll put them in Volume 2 of the photo gallery.  Good timing
too as I will be closing it off to updates as I need to work on my car &
drive it!  So, if you'd like you can mail them to:

Phil Tong

Take care and thanks again for the message!
Phil
