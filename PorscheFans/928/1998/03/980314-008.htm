Thomas (and others who store ther cars):

A two-week drain on a car battery is fairly significant.  Using some simple
math,  let's say that the battery has a 60 amp hour capacity, and starts out
this ordeal fully charged.  Two weeks is 336 hours.  The amp-hour capacity
is the amount of current used before the battery is drawn down to 10.5
volts.  In your situation the battery is dead, so the numbers we generate
here are conservative.  So, 60 amp hours consumed in 300 hours would be 200
milliamps drain, or about one-fifth of an amp.  Since the battery is dead,
the drain is likely to be more than 200 milliamps.

Your first task (after charging the battery) might be to try and trace the
accessory that's draining the battery.  Look to see if the interior lights
are on.  Several times I've left the rear lid unlatched, only to notice the
interior lights are on.  With all the lamps in my S4,  it's like a night
football game inside with the commensurate current drain.

Now on to the search:  Start with the battery cables;  They won't drain the
battery,  but the ground cable to the frame provides a convenient place to
insert an ammeter.  If there's current flowing more than a few milliamps,
start disconnecting things to see what's stealing the power.  Pull fuses
from the panel one by one to isolate the drain to one circuit,  then look at
individual components in that circuit.  You'll need the current diagrams
from the shop manual to trace the circuit details if it's not obvious what
the components are.

Some car alarms are pretty significant current hogs.  Aftermarket stereo
amplifiers run all the time unless they are wired correctly to the head
unit, and even then can still draw a bit of power to the sensing circuits.
It will be stuff like this that should get your first attention.



On the subject of the 'low resistance' battery cable:  The battery cable
provides a path for current flow between the battery in the rear, and the
starter, alternator, and fuse/power distribution panel in the front.  A
cable will not cause your battery to go dead unless it has worn insulation
causing a short circuit.  While the better cable is certainly a good idea,
it doesn't figure in to your 'current' problem.


On the trickle charger:  I have a slew of toys with batteries in them, from
Jet-Ski's, Sea-Doos, motorcycles, three race cars of various types, to the
portable generator.  Keeping them alive in the off-season(s) is handled by
inexpensive automatic chargers available at Wal-Mart stores and other
places.  I use a 1.5 amp Schumacher charger that's about the size of a
couple hockey pucks give or take, and can live permanently attached to the
battery.  The charger uses simple logic to turn itself on when the terminal
voltage goes below 13, and off when  it reaches 14 volts.  The 1.5 amp
capacity means that there isn't enough current to cause cell gassing and
electrolyte loss, although you should monitor level on a regular basis just
to be sure.  The charger sells for about $25, including some mounting
brackets for the permanent installation.  One of the guys on the jetski
usenet group turned me on to them, and they are wonderful.  They hang on the
rack ain a bubble pack, over the boxed chargers.  They will not restore a
dead battery, though, since the logic won't allow current into less than
about a ten volt load.  You'll need a regular charger for that, or a jump start.



Add one of those battery testers to your arsenal of tools.  The one I'm
using is less than $4, and tests the specific gravity of the battery fluid
to tell whether it can hold a charge.  The ones with the floating balls are
about a dollar, and would be fine for casual use.

Boat ownership has taught me to use dielectric grease on all connections
subject to corrosion.  This is Dow #5 bushing flashover grease from the
industrial hardware store,  or silicone dielectric grease sold as "spark
plug grease" at better auto parts stores.  Use it in the plug boots, and on
battery and frame ground connections. If you have a electrical connector
apart for some reason,  a thin film of this will keep corrosion at bay.  You
guys that live in humid or salt-enhanced climates might benefit from this. 

A good multimeter is a must too.  The digital ones from Radio Shack will
work just fine.  Be sure to get one that will support a ten amp current
measurement, and has a fuse in the loop.  Get spare fuses, too (trust me...)


Hope this helps!
