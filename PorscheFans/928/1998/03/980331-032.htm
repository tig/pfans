I received many comments on the fact that I listen to the engine instead =
of
the radio and I have discovered that 1 person doing it is a weirdo, 2-3
people doing it is a group of weirdos,  a whole snotload of people doing =
it
is a brotherhood.  I also try to catch up to any other Sharks I see on th=
e
road just to wave and identify with someone else who has a love for these=

cars and I am surprised if they don't wave back.  From now on we should
have a rule that anyone that doesn't wave or smile or say hi,  we'll take=

their 928 from them and replace it with a Ford Taurus.  That'll teach
them!!  Or maybe it wont!!  =3D-0    Be looking for you on the road.
