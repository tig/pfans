Hello all,

  I live in the San Francisco bay area and recently purchased an 1989
GT - black with the silver-grey interior.

  I am very happy with the car but wanted advice on:

 Tyres/tires - no tread left on rears and oversize 235s on the front. 
Need to replace them. What is the concensus on best tyres for the
money with optimum balance between grip and durability?  Also, where
should I purchase them from - local dealer or mailorder?

 Shocks/suspension - if the shocks need replacing what would other
owners recommend mainly for street use?  Want best handling without
sacrificing the ability to deal with the numerous potholes in the bay
area.

 What is the typical duration of clutches in these cars - does it vary
from 5,000 miles if you drive like an idiot to 40,000 if you drive
more conservatively?  Would a GTS clutch last longer in this car?

 Rear air conditioner vents are loose - how do I get the unit apart so
that I can fit new screws into the vents?

 Where can I buy a used tyre compressor and jack for this 928?

P.S.  I realise that most of these questions are asked and answered
frequently, but the archives are not yet searchable.

regards

David Sidwell
89GT (black/silver-grey)
