Fellow Shark Chums:

Several have responded to the note about Eibach Springs and their
relationship with Automotion.  A couple have asked if these are the
"Weltmeister" brand that Automotion sells.

[[drum roll...]]

I don't have a clue.

My relationship with Eibach is part of a development project completely
dissociated from the aftermarket lowering and handling packages they make.
We were in their shop installing some beta parts on one of my cars when I
thought to ask if they make any replacement coils for the 928. They told me
they do, but they are exclusive to Automotion.  That was the end of the
discussion,   and we went on to work on the original project.

Those with a continuing interest in this subject should visit their website
at www.eibach.com, or call Automotion to trace the history of the parts.  I
don't think Eibach will even discuss the relationship.


My original comment was supposed to be read as "Don't bother calling Eibach,
as they only market through Automotion."  As usual I was misconscrewed,  for
which I apologise.  Should have sailed on quietly, but no....
