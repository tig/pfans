	Hey Tom Green,

	How did you get the oil pan on/off, did the motor have to be 
disconnected fron the torque tube?  How did you raise the motor?  Did you 
have to reach in to remove the oil pick up, before getting the pan off?

	Typically a cork gasket and very low torque bolts are used where the 
cover will distort easily.  A long time ago my dad helped me work on my 
sisters rabbit, the valve cover (sheet metal) leaked so he tightened it, 
then it really leaked!  The 928 oil pan is a casting and looks fairly 
rigid so that shouldn't be a problem.

	It would seem the ideal setup would be a sealer and lock washers (like 
you have done) and maybe the green loctite on the bolt heads after 
installed.  Tighten the bolts only enough to compress the washers, the 
trick to a good seal is not distorting the parts.  You can have metal 
cantact at the bolts and a gap between bolts.

	I think most of my leaks are at the cam boxes. If you check the oil path 
there is pressure oil going up to the cam box, through a hole in the 
gasket.  It will leak down each side of the motor, over the header and 
all around the oil pan and drip off the starter.  What a mess but I only 
use a few quarts a year.  Just changed the crank seal, easy once you get 
the cam belt off, the crank cam gear put up a fight and ended up in the 
trash.  I could have put that gear back on but why take a chance, that 
and it was cheap! That silly roller that does almost nothing, mounts 
under the belt tension, that cost a few bucks!

	Advice for the day, when doing the T-belt always change the black 
plastic bushings on the tensioner pivot, they wear out.  Once the 
bushings wear out the tensioner can wobble and the belt will ride to the 
front edge or rear and wear on the belt will be very rapid. Plastic 
bushings $25. engine $10,000, math word problems are always so hard! The 
edge of the belt is not supposed to ride against anything!  Order all the 
parts you think you need, take it apart then order a bunch more!  It 
really is cheaper and easier to do things once, something about doing 
things over just not fun!
