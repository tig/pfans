In celebration of the arrival of Spring in the Northern Hemisphere I
will waste a few minutes on drivel about the quality of e-mail on the
list.

We complain when do not use factory parts, but we always want to know if
AutoZone has it available.

A millennium of time has been spent on the proper care and coating of
lug nuts, not to mention colette's (Who is she any way?)

Some members have hybrid cars with non-Porsche engines.  Alas not the
best of all worlds, but it does keep the marquee on the road.  After all
there are too few too 928's out there to begin with and the less cars
chopped for parts the better, unless I need parts.  

Are all these wheels usable on our 928's?  If so do we want 911 Series
leftovers?  Do we need to ask if we are going to have a tire pressure
sensor problems when we replace stock wells with after's?

Sex and / or smoke in your car,  the mileage you get depends on how you
drive............Now whose feet were engaged in the steering wheel?

When will the .."I just tried to start my car for the first time since
last October and .....................

When will the A/C questions start to flood the web?

Should we formally pass our condolences to the Southern Hemisphere
members, or should we just smirk because now it is our turn.

What is Rooting anyway?  and is it enjoyable?  Two guys jumping bones
will never get you membership to the 700 Club.

Talk about Jaguars on OUR LIST.   If you think 928's have cute
electrical gremlin's wait until you meet LUCAS, Prince of Darkness.

Oil leaks, yes yes a thousand times yes....  Just imagine the fun those
Generation-X Boxster owners will have in the future with a Porsche with
no topside engine access!

I believe that by now we have contracted deficiencies from too little UV
exposure and the cure is you know what.  Soooooooo Gentlemen and Ladies:

Start your battery chargers

Inflate your tires

Remove your car covers (maybe do this first)

Get those Xmas lights boxes of the car too.....

Get in and reacquaint yourself with your better half, before you need to
start cutting the grass.
