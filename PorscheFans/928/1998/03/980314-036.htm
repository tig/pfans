HI All!

Just test drove an 86 shark (SN <1000), meteor metallic/maroon, with
156K miles, 5speed
manual.  Just had new timing belt and water pump installed.  Exterior
paint is original and
excellent.

By my observations, it has the following problems:

1)  missing splash shield under radiator
2) needs tires all around, evidence of significantly greater wear on
inside side edge of
    front tires;     clearly needs an alignment
3) radio has problems
4) recent history of overheating: Gaudin Ford/Porshe recommends new
radiator at $1K
    Some minor floating brown gunk in coolant fill tank.
5) 156K miles of wear on driver's side leather, especially at left hip
area
6)  2 tiny windshield kisses by small rocks (tiny pits only, no stars or
spreading)
7) mechanical fan clutch suspected bad
8) Gaudin Ford/Porsche recommended replacement of oil lines to cooler
9) Some minor vibration of unknown origin (not noticed by current
owner), seemed too
   high in frequency to be related to wheel balance issues..... drive
shaft/tube ?

Frankly, I have learned from the readers on this list to question
everything, so that is
the best list I could come up with, being as critical as possible.  Did
not do a
compression check.  Engine seemed strong.  Everything else about the car

seemed in very good shape for the number of miles.

Questions:

a)  My '84 had similar tire wear / alignment problems.  Is this a known
problem with,
perhaps, springs tiring or fatigue with age?
b)  Anyone have experience with cooling system problems, particularly
flushing out crud
resulting from potentially the wrong antifreeze used by a PO?  They
added an electric
fan in front of the radiator to alleviate overheating (this IS Las Vegas
after all....)
c)  As this was my first drive of a 5speed manual, I wasn't sure if long
clutch travel
is normal (clutch engages with clutch pedal approximately 2/3 out)
c)  The asking price of $8900 OBO seems a bit high....comments?
d)  Should I pursue this one, or wait for better?

Thanx one and all!
