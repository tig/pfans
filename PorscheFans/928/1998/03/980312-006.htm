Hi Greg,

Great!  Glad you got the mats!  The project's comming along, thanks for
asking.  I make a little more progress each night.  Boy, I can't wait to
drive this thing!  It feels like it's been forever!  The trans. is about
ready to go back in.  I'll re-install the torque convertor tonight, and
put the front cover back on.  Then I just have to take off the pan,
clean and paint it, and put in a new filter.  I'll probably re-install
the trans. and rear suspension this weekend.  Then I have to finish the
front shocks (Boy those are a bitc# to R/R!), and the oil-pan gasket
(another bitc#!).

In my poking around, I've also noticed that both my front cam seals and
front crankshaft seal are also leaking :-(.  Since the timing belt's
gotta come off to do those, and I just changed the timing belt last
year(!), that's gonna have to wait...

Uh huh...  I keep saying that too...   ;-)




> Oh, question......were you able to put on pan gasket without removing >the steering rack?



Nope.  It's damn near impossible!  I had the engine jacked up really far
too.  The oil pick-up is in the way, you just can't pull the pan forward
enough to get it out.  Somebody posted that they were able to reach in
there and undo the bolts and let it fall down into the pan, but I had
visions of the jacks letting go and getting my hand severed in there!
TOO SCARY FOR ME!  Besides, I couldn't figure how I'd get it back in
there again!  After I get the trans. back in, I'm just gonna drop the
sterring rack and see if that works better.  The pan's just hanging
there bleeding oil right now.  =8-o
