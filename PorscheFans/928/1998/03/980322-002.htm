Regarding the seemingly endless discussions over the relative merits of
various brands and types of oil, wax, batteries, tires, water wetters,
spark plugs, shock absorbers, frammises, wellingers, crownyangs,
fillyloobergers, etc.  After driving Porsches as long as there have been
Porsches, I'd like to say this:  I just like to drive them.  I try to hold
all that other stuff in a strictly secondary or supporting space in my mind. 

Obviously if you buy crap, thats what you get.  However, thinking that
something has to have the Porsche imprimatur, or official sanction on it to
be good is, basically admitting that you are indeed a victim of modern
American advertising.   Porsches are great automobiles.  I've long since
forgotten exactly how many of them I've owned.  However, they are cars, not
mystical embodiments of automotive engineers wet dreams come true.  

They have lots of problems which cost a helluva lot of money to fix.
Anything that a Japanese or American automotive engineer can design  to do
simply, German  engineers can find a way to do a little better in a much
more complicated and expensive manner.  

To me, a Porsche designed $4600.00 mountain bike is a sick joke for idiots
who have far more money than brains.  Porsche designed sunglasses or
garbage disposals, or nose hair trimmers, pander to the lowest common
denominator of subhuman intelligence. 

I've been driving them all these years because I feel that they are the
best all round cars for the type of driving I do.  I don't give a tinker's
dam if the battery or spark plugs are made by someone other than Porsche as
long as the quality is there, especially knowing that Porsche in most
cases, buys those parts from the same people, with the addition of
"Porsche factory approved parts" or whatever, stamped on them, which then
allows them to charge twice or three times as much per item.

I've had just as many problems with "Porsche approved factory parts" as I
have with those from outside suppliers.  I think that some members of this
list have a tendency to get so caught up in the technical minutiae of the
breed that they epitomize the old saw about not being able to see the
forest for the trees.

If your thing is to get under or into the car to work on it, then fine.
But if you love to drive them for the pure pleasure of  feeling one of the
best cars ever designed under the seat of your jeans, then just get good
parts in them and drive them with the sense of brio, panache, and joie de
vivre they were designed for.
