Daniel,

All the things you say make perfect sense but:  Last night around midnight,
I came out of a restaurant and the temperature was probably in the high
sixties.  We didn't drive more than a mile when the AC came on full blast.
When it does that, it continues as long as I don't shut it off.  However,
if I shut it for for a fairly extended period of time, say a quarter of an
hour, and then turn it back on at low speed, it may stay on low for upwards
of 15 or twenty minutes, or it may go full blast within a minute or two.
The outside air  temperature doesn't seem to have much effect on it one way
or the other.

And, as Tom Green mentioned, he replaced the entire resistor pack on his
car and the condition persists.  Go figure.

MILE
>TRIP AND ITS 90 DEGREES OUTSIDE. YOU GET IN YOUR CAR AND TURN A/C ON HIGH
>SPEED FAN AND MAX. COOL.
>2 MILES DOWN THE ROAD THE WIFE STARTS COMPLAINING ITS GETTING TO COOL INSDE
>CAR. YOU REACH UP AND TURN FAN SPEED DOWN TO 2ND SPEED. EVERYTHING IS FINE
FAN
>IS STILL ON 2ND SPEED AND YOU AND THE MISSES ARE QUITE COMFORTABLE. ALL OF A
>SUDDEN FAN SPEED JUMPS UP TO A HIGHER SPEED ON ITS OWN. YOUR QUITE PUZZLED
AND
>BLAIM IT ON THE WIFE. (HA HA) 2 OR 3 MINUTES LATER FAN SPEED RETURNS TO 2ND
>SPEED. THIS IS HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK!!!
>WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS ON HIGH SPEED FAN ALL 12 VOLTS ARE RUNNING BLOWER MOTOR
>AND CURRENT FLOW DOES NOT GO THRU RESISTOR.
>WHEN YOU TURN FAN DOWN TO 2ND  SPEED MANUALLY WITH FAN KNOB ON THE CONSOLE
YOU
>ARE REDIRECTING CURRENT FLOW THRU RESISTOR.
>WHAT HAPPENS  ELECTRICALLY IS YOU ARE SENDING 12 VOLTS INTO A RESISTOR AND IT
>COMES OUT OF RESISTOR AND GOES TO BLOWER MOTOR. BUT KNOW ITS (SAY FOR
EXAMPLE)
>7.5 VOLTS. IN THE PROCESS OF LIMITING VOLTAGE THRU A RESISTOR HEAT IS
CREATED.
>THIS HEAT MUST BE COOLED DOWN OR THE RESISTOR WILL OVERHEAT AND OPEN UP
>ELECTRICALLY. THERE IS A BI-METALLIC SET OF POINTS ON THE RESISTOR PACK AND
>WHEN RESISTOR PACK GETS TOO WARM THE POINTS CLOSE AND TAKE CHARGE OF BLOWER
>SPEED. WHEN THERE IS ENOUGH AIR BLOWING ACROSS RESISTOR PACK THE POINTS COOL
>DOWN AND OPEN UP SO THE 2ND SPEED RESISTOR TAKES OVER AGAIN. THE WHOLE
PROCESS
>STARTS OVER AGAIN. THE SAME SCENARIO IS TRUE FOR HEATING AS WELL. I DID READ
>TOM'S POST THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS AND DID E-MAIL HIM AS WELL. BOTH OF YOU GUYS
>NEVER MENTIONED IF FAN SPEED RETURNS TO LOWER SPEED ON ITS OWN OR NOT,OR
STAYS
>ON HIGH FOREVER. I HAVEN'T TRIED POSTING ANYTHING TO FANS CLUB TODAY BEEN
BUSY
>WITH HONEY DOO'S. (HA HA). IF YOUR TALKING ABOUT A MODEL BOXSTER, I ALREADY
>HAVE SEVERAL. IF YOUR TALKING ABOUT A REAL BOXSTER ANY COLOR WILL BE JUST
>FINE!!!! I GOT TO WORK ON A BOXSTER LAST MONDAY. THE TEST DRIVE WAS
>UNBELIEVABLE. IT HAD A 5 SPEED TIPTRONIC AND A HARD TOP. I WAS TRULY IN
>PORSCHE HEAVEN!!!!!!!
