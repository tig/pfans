Bill,
Sounds to me like the factory roof rack. Porsche used to make ( may still be
available) a roof rack system for the 928, it's basic components are
comprised of the main front and rear rails.  You can then add attachments
for skis, bikes, kayaks and there is also a square luggage rack that looks
similar to an off-road safari rack (probably what you saw)   The front rails
clips in at the front of your door area (open your door and look in the
corner area just before it slopes down to the door and you will see the
indented area where it fits). The rear rail bolts on the body underneath the
rear hatch ( open rear hatch look 3" down from the upper corner area and you
will see 2 Allen head bolts). It is very secure and allows for operation of
the sunroof and opening of the rear hatch.

Ironic that you bring this up because I am calling my local Porsche Parts
Dude tomorrow to check and see if they are still available.
