  There are two places I know of that sell Bursch cat bypass pipes: 
  GPR (www.gprparts.com) and Europroducts (1-800-962-0911).  For the
  '83, the bypass is a simple bolt-on and has a threaded hole to retain
  the O2 sensor.  The air pump has a tube which normally attaches to the
  cat, so once you remove the cat the tube will just be left open.  The
  pipe attaches with three bolts at the end of each exhaust manifold and
  continues to location of the rear flange of the cat (4 bolts).  The iron
  doughnut gasket that the cat uses is discarded and replaced by a
  reinforced flat gasket.
  
  The tone with the bypass is much louder and raspier than stock so it's
  a subjective matter as to whether or not this is an improvement, but the
  typical hot-rodder type will like it.  A seat-of-the-pants impression
  is that the pipe gives a bit of a power increase, but without real 
  measuring equipment, there's no way to know for sure.
