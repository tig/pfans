John:

[It is my observation that] The only friction that keeps the lug nuts/bolts
from coming loose in normal operation is the friction at the cup and cone
where the face of the nut contacts the wheel.  With this in mind, adding
something like never-seize to this face will allow the nuts to come off at
less than opportune times.  The outside of nuts are annodized to cut down on
the galvanic problem, but the threads are not.  The annodized face is a bit
harder, and so will help with the galling you mention also.

With this in mind,  it's quite unlikely that I will use never-seize on the
nuts at all.  The technique I described is for the benefit of thise who feel
thet -have- to do something about a 'potential' problem.  (sorry...)


If I was going to put it on the face of the nut at the wheel,  I'd be sure
to safety-wire the valve stems to the door handles so I wouldn't have to
walk so far to recover my wheels.

Your observations may be different.
