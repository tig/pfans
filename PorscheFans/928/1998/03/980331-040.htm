Maybe this will will repeat other messages but just in case
I will post my experience with a stuck power seat.

I had the same problem on my 83 928s.  To solve it I had to
remove the seat.  This is not a simple operation when you can't
slide the seat.  The 83 928 has a manual mechanism to default the motor.
This mechanism is a black rod about 1/4 inch in diameter that when
moved sideways disengages a gear from the motor.  In my case this
mechanism was also stuck.

The seat is held in place by four allen screws (metric ).  You may be able
to see
the front allen screws.  Remove these.  Next, remove black plastic covers in
the back and right of the seat.  The covers are held in place by Phillips
screws that,
when the seat in is stuck all the way back, are hard to remove.  A short
phillips
screw driver helps.  Also, lift the rear of the seat as much as you can with
the up-down power button.  The right-rear allen screw will be easy to remove
once the seat is all the way up.  The left-rear allen screw is hard to
reach (patience).

After the four screws are out disconnect electrical power and lift the
seat out.  Next, remove the motor of the front-rear mechanism by
removing a black bracket held by three black screws (10 or 11 mm screws).
You may test your motor now by connecting it to the wire that was left
in the car (the one that sends power to the seat motors).

It will be easy now to reinstall the seat if you can slide the seat back
and forth.
In my case I am careful not to move the seat all the way back so it doesn't
get stuck
again.  The manual default works well now and I use it most of the time.
If somebody finds a way such that the seat does not get stuck again let me
know.
