Dear "Land Shark" tamers:

Apparently, I was not the first to use the term "S3" to refer to the 85 & 86
U.S. 928s.
For those of you that have a copy of the "Porsche 928 Performance Portfolio
1977-1994" please refer to pages 83 and 110. For those of you without the
book, the following is a brief excerpt from page 83. "American customers
have been driving a 5-litre 32-valve 928 known as the S3 since 1985." On
page 110 it says. "For the record, the S4 is not the first 928 to have a
32-valve twin-cam engine, however, for that distinction goes to the S3, a
United States market clean air special."

With this, I hope this topic is over and done with. Thank you for indulging
the clarification. Now let's get on with topics of real importance. Happy
motoring. Ed
