Well, having been there and done that once before, here's what I can tell
you.  You probably can't repair the plastic tank.  It's held onto the core
by tabs, which probably won't take too kindly to being bent out and then
rebent again.  I bought a Behr replacement radiator from Eurasian Parts
(800-824-8814) in Temecula, CA, for about $500 two years ago. I think 928
International (800-634-6117) in Anaheim, CA, would also be able to come up
with a better than dealer price (who knows, they might be better than
Eurasian).  It was a breeze to install; most certainly a DIY job.

I didn't look around for a better than original replacement:  in
retrospect, I should have done so but didn't even consider it.  

BTW, while you're in there, change every hose you can get to and flush the
engine block.  Then you'll be set for a good while.
