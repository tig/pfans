Page 30 of the owners manual for my 87 S4 states, under "Light Switch-with
ignition on":

In positions 1 and 2, the following lights are also on:

        tail lights
        instrument illumination
        shirft pattern illimination for automatic transmission selector lever

On page 31 is the discussion of the indicator system for position of the
gearshift lever on the tachometer.

Currently  the indicator lamps by the shift lever do not light, and the
drive position indicator on the tachometer is out, although all other
postions on the tach do light.  That problem is the contact by the shift
lever, and I suspect that I have bulbs out down there as well.  Service due
next week.

Question:  my wiper motor has ceased to funciton.  It stopped after it was
cycled...that is, I hit the switch, it moved about 2 1/2 inches and stopped
in its tracks.

I have replaced the relay with no results, and canNOT find a fuse, as the
fuse box directory shows no fuse for this circuit.  Since there was no odor,
I suspect there is a fuse somewhere....any thoughts?

Roger
