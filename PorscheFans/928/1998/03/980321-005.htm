Dear fellow "land shark" tamers:
Sorry to have been so long since my last post, but other "club"
responsibilities beckon.
    
There are two good ways to replace the front shocks. The one recommended in
the service manual is fine if you have good tools, lots of time, and are
careful around the upper ball joint boot. The other method calls for
dropping the lower control arm and removing the shock down and out. Method
two works well but is a bit of a tight fit.  I have done it both ways and
prefer method two. With all due respect to those that find it impossible, it
is not. I found it considerably easier and less time consuming. Both methods
do not affect the alignment if the ride height is kept the same. Usually,
the height will change if the springs are changed to stiff (and lower) ones.
In that case the car will need a realignment when you are done.

For th person(s) with the "always hot" heater, try cleaning your cabin
thermostat fan blades. It's in the slotted holes on the front of the dash,
next to the central vent. In there is a fan that draws cabin air across the
thermostat sensor. If the fan blades are dirty, little to no air is drawn.
Another item to clean is the outside temperature sensor. It's in the hose
that allows air to cool the alternator. In U.S. cars, it's in in the panel
in front of the left front tire. To clean it, disconnect the electrical
connection and clean out the male and female ends of that connector.

At this time I want to thank Ernie Porter for the kind words. As he
mentioned, the next "Frenzy" will be in VA. To be specific, it will be at
AutoThority in Fairfax, VA on 9/26/97. An autocross and low key concours
will follow the next day.

Happy motoring. Ed
