The McClaren has yet to prove itself??? They bleedin' won LeMans OUTRIGHT
their first
time at the game!! (And to me, LeMans is the only race that matters...the
most fun
to watch, and the hardest one to find any TV coverage on...at least where I
live :( )
Don't recall if the McClarens took the flag their second time out, but I do
know they
were in the top 3. Has the F50 actually accomplished anything beyond being
red, pricey,
and fast? :)

Required 928 content: Just washed the S4 Saturday and it is looking
downright resplendant on the driveway right now...sometimes I have to
remember to take a moment
and just ogle the darn thing! (Before hopping in for a spirited spin...)

metallic...one                  of the VERY few cars I would give up the 928
keys for)
