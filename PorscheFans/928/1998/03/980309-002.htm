Wrong. When you tighten the lug nut appropriately, you are stretching
the stud it is threaded onto. The residual tensile stress in the stud
is the force that locks the male and female threads together so that
the lug doesn't loosen. The torque on the nut is intended to give
the right amount of elastic stretch to the stud, so that this will
happen.

The fly in the ointment is lubrication. The amount of stretch for
a given torque on a dry lug may be only 40 percent of that on one
well lubricated with anti-seize, according to some charts in one
of Carroll Smith's books. The difference of course goes to 
overcoming friction between the nut and the lug and wheel, in
the rotational direction. Since I haven't seen our wheel studs
break while being tightened with a torque wrench, and I have
seen lugs seized so that they have to be cut off (the shop
manual even has instructions for this), I for one will keep
both threads and faces of my wheel lugs nicely touched up with
anti-seize. One more reason to wear those rubber gloves
when changing tires at the track.
