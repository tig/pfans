Gene,

If you buy something from Porsche you have a much better chance of getting
as good or  better than the original quality, if  you buy from whomever you
are getting their version of quality. This can be great or terrible, that's
the problem, you just don't know.

With Porsche on the other hand you have a darn good chance of the quality
being consistent.

I can give you an example that has nothing to do with Porsche. A few years
ago I bought a "rebuilt with factory parts" waterpump for my Jeep at Napa
(had lifetime warranty etc.).  A month later I start to hear a strange sound
coming from the engine and waterpump area which gets drastically worse over
the next few weeks.
I pull the pump off and see that the impeller was eating its way through the
pump housing, not quite the quality I was assured of.

So I go buy a rebuilt pump from the Jeep dealership ( cost me $12 more than
the other one).
When I pulled it out of the box I was immediately amazed at how heavy it
was, it weight twice the weight compared to what  the "High Quality Rebuilt
with Factory Parts" pump weighed.

This immediately told me that I was dealing with a little denser metal in
the factory pump casing and that the other was a "Cost Effective Asian
Version". made from CRAP!

Water pump is now 3 years old and quiet as a mouse.

Yes, I remember those Japanese and American cars back in the 70's, with all
of the technology and features that a 928 has ;-)
It is easy for anyone to copy and improve technology once a company has done
all of the expensive R&D,  engineering, and design.

>To me, a Porsche designed $4600.00 mountain bike is a sick joke for idiots
>who have far more money than brains
Strange, in all of the mountain bike magazines I have read, the mountain
bike experts have given them rave reviews!!  There are many more mountain
bikes out there that cost much, much more than the Porsche bikes (some of
them from the so-called inexpensive Japanese and American companies). You do
get what you pay for and granted some of that cost is in the name,( I think
most companies out there wish they could create such a name that is
synonymous with Performance, Innovation and Quality so they could charge a
premium for it ).

Sounds like you are just trying to bust anyone's and everyone's bubble, if
you can't afford or aren't willing to pay for something and others can and
will doesn't make them an Idiot.

Is the owner of a Ferrari F50 an idiot?  He can't be too much of an idiot if
he can afford to buy it!!! ( whether he made the money by himself or was
smart enough to marry into it ;-)

>I've been driving them all these years because I feel that they are the
<snip>
>"Porsche factory approved parts" or whatever, stamped on them, which then
>allows them to charge twice or three times as much per item.
I don't know of anything that costs 2 or 3 times as much, give me some
examples, we are only talking 15-25% more to be assured of quality and to
support the only company that will make all of our replacement parts for
many years to come.
Don't get me wrong, I have never suggested to anyone to go buy their Bosh
Platinums at the dealership for $9, when you can get them at Pep Boys for
$4. However buying a rebuilt waterpump from "Joe Blow" for $80-90 when you
can get a Porsche rebuilt unit  for $107 is a different story.

>I've had just as many problems with "Porsche approved factory parts" as I
>have with those from outside suppliers.

How would you know unless you are "indeed a victim of modern
American advertising" and have been buying Porsche Factory parts? ;-)

I am terribly sorry to bore you with technical babble on this 928 site,
let's get back to the cats, Miata's and the latest sales going on at Sears.
