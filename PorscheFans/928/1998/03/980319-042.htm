  Did you pull the plastic covers off the front of the engine in order to
  determine that the leak was beneath the water pump?  (Otherwise, I'm not 
  sure how you would be able to pinpoint that location.)  When my water pump 
  gave out, antifreeze would drip down the front of the engine behind the 
  covers and show up in a small pool in the fins of the oil pan.  
  
  You might check the gaskets at each end of the crossover manifold that 
  contains the thermostat since (according to my mechanic) these can start 
  to leak with age.  If the pump really is leaking, I would strongly recommend
  replacing it soon so that you don't get caught with a catastrophic failure
  and subsequent overheating.  Since the t-belt has to come off to replace 
  the pump anyway, buy a new belt and install it at the same time.  Make 
  sure you or your mechanic have the proper tensioning guage to use during 
  reassembly.
  
  FWIW, options for replacing water pumps appear to be:
  
     New (2yr warranty) - ~$380
     Porsche rebuild from Germany (2yr warranty) - ~$280
     PCNA rebuild (2yr warranty) - ~$110
     other rebuild (? warranty) - as low as $79
