Robert,
First off, go easy on those CAPS, our ears are still ringing ;-)

Secondly,  you are most likely low on automatic transmission fluid.
Reservoir is located on the passenger side rear of your car just in front of
the rear suspension cross member. Wipe the gunk off of it and you will see
the "full" line. Start engine , put it in neutral (make sure parking brake
in fully operational and on), take a flashlight and try to see where the
fluid level is and refill to full mark. A long time ago in a galaxy far away
when I owned an auto I used one of those hand fluid pumps to pump fluid into
the reservoir.

While you are under there take a close look at the front of your transaxle
(where the torque tube bolts to trans), most likely you will see
transmission fluid in this area indicating a front seal leak.

P.S. Make sure you are not in Park when you check the level, it can fool you
and look full even when it is not.
