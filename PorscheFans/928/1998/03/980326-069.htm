Phil, Hi my name is Leonard
I innocently posted the infamous wheel close out ad.
If at all possible would you be kind enough to post this apology to the
lists that I
infected with the add.  It's really bothering me and my family. I would
like to address
everyone in a civil way.
I know that this is a lot to ask, But I am not comfortable posting to
the list anymore
for obvious reasons. Please let me know If you don't want to do this.
I understand.


To everyone on the Porsche Fans lists.
I Leonard M. (wicked 9's ) am truly sorry that I caused you to be
saturated with
my post about the wheel close outs. I only sent 2 full posts and one
statement posts.
Unfortunately I sent them to all lists at the same time. (A big no-no) I
did not know
that this causes an anomaly within the list that keeps posting the ad. I
truly am not
selling the wheels myself. I am just like you all trying to stay inform
and contribute every
once in awhile. I thought and still think they are good prices and a
good quality product.
So therefore I thought I would pass the Info on. Now I wish I hadn't and
in some ways
I am glad I did.  Let me explain. I love cars period. Porsches most I
have 2, and I like
people that share the enthusiasm that I have for them. I expect to be
spamed or whatever it is called and I can take it. But to think A LOT of
people would actually
e-mail me and threaten me and family members is ridiculous. My five year
old can get
my e-mail and for her to read threats against me, the cursing and name
calling worries
me. If you all (the people that hid behind false names and threatened me
on e-mail)
take a innocent mistake that far then I don't want to be associated with
you anyway.
I don't care about the people that criticized me in a civil way, I have
broad shoulders.
I will live and learn. It will not happen again from me. But someone
will make the mistake again. I just hope that you treat them a little
more civil. I you have or plan to e-mail me with more threats, I simply
wouldn't suggest it. (That only pertains to the
people that did so) For the other Porsche Fans that took the time to
read another
post from me thank you for listening, I truly am sorry.

Thanks
