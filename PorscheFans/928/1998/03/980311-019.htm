Howdy,

I've been subscribing as a non-owner to the digest for over a month now and 
I got a tell you it is great even though it seems that the digest looks 
like some sort of 12 step program for 928 owners.

So let me start things off with:
"Hello my name is Kevin and I own a 1986 928S"

Well my 1986 928S arrived yesterday and I am already assessing what I have 
to do to get it fully road ready.  The previous owner had kept the driver 
side window in place with cardboard.  I took off the inside of the door 
following the directions someone else posted and discovered the motor 
hanging in mid-air.  Seem the folks that replaced the glass never quite 
snugged up the bolts or the motor never worked.  So. my question is:

How do I reattach the motor.  I guess I need to get technical specs on how 
the assembly works and attaches to the door.   Anybody got any ideas?  I 
guess I could take a look inside the passengerside door.  But I'd rather 
avoid that.
