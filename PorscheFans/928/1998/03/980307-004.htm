	Okay;=20

	I can take the RK (Rodney King) Beating on the RADAR =
thing...........but to attack my less than exemplary speliinng....... =
now that's gitting personnnnnaaaal.    NUB SAID!

	By the way, I've owned my first 928 for about a week now, and was =
somewhat dismayed at the racket the windshield wiper motors seem to =
make. They seem to work fine, but I would have expected them to be a =
little quieter for such a refined car.
	I can't quantify the noise, it just seems too LOUD for this car. I'm =
thinking Ford Pinto when I listen to these things.

	Any thoughts on this?


	Any 928 owners in Chicago that want to welcome me to the fold?

	Oh yeah, one more thing.
	If you are selling your 928 (86 or later) and want to move the shop =
manuals too, I'll be glad to take them off your hands.
