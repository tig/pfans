I bought my current 928 with the Jacobs system installed.  The only
"down side", is that it can be a limiting factor if you also like to
putter with upgraded ignition wires (like NOlogy's) or special spark
plugs (like split fire or torquemasters).  The Jocabls unit relies on
conventional arrangments to "read" whats tanspiring in the combustion
chamber.

I can tell you about the before-and-after on my last Porsche, a 924 S.
The Jacobs unit made the car more responsive in the midrange, and made
the idle as smooth as anything I've driven ( it was originally
somewhat reminiscent of a deisel Jetta- due to the cams, I'm told).

The system, complete with the strongest coil, was well worth the money
to me.  IT did cause some additional wear on cap and rotor, probably
due to the extra juice from the coil.

The 928 system on my car does consist of two independant "brain"
systems, which adds markedly to the cost.  However, they have recently
been marketing a combined coil/computer that is cheaper- unkonwn if
its appropriate for our application.

As for M.S.D., I would've put it on my G.T.O befor trying the Jacobs,
but I'm not too sure that multips sparks are as viable on a highly
managed fuel injected car compared with the inefficient '67 G.M.
version.  I would wager that gains would be nominal, Porsche could've
easily included that technology in their "flagship" if they had seen
fit to do so.

P.S.-  I think  of all you guys referring to our 928s as "sharks"
everytime I see an add for the 'Tiburon'.         =8- (
