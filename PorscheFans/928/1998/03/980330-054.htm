I'm pleased to see the likes of Phil Tong fixing
the likes of his S4 with a coat hanger.  There is a
place for me and my car after all.

Anyway, I have a question for 928 drivers and
performance drivers with more experience than
me.  Under very heavy breaking, my 928 wiggles
left and right with high frequency (maybe 5-6
times a heartbeat).  It doesn't pull one way or the
other, just swings hard and fast a few inches
back and forth, mainly at the front.  It even does
this when the brakes are cold.   Is this an
indicator that I need to get bigger brakes, or just
learn to brake differently, or might it indicate that
one of the brakes are below standard.  I have one
dry rear shock - could that be it?  I'm planning to
go to Koni shocks soon.

thanks
