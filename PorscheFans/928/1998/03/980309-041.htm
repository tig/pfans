Hey 928 Fans!

This is message is probably getting nauseating for some of you   
porschefans (sorry), but I thought I'd try it again to make sure   
everyone's read about this before I make a purchase:  Please pass the   
word to any Shark Fans that you know who are not the WEB.

I hope to reach anyone with a 928 S4 or GT for sale that needs a some TLC   
to get back on the road, BEFORE they take the plunge with the Porsche   
mechanic, and invest $$ that probably won't come back out.  If you or   
anyone you know has a 928 garaged or waiting for the bucks to get it   
serviced, please give me a shout!!

I already own two 928s; one's fully restored and the other's a parts car,   
but I am looking for an S4 or GT with a high mileage or blown engine   
and/or blown tranny (4 speed auto): Anyway, one that needs lots of parts   
and a good mechanic, so it may not be worth fixing for the owner.  A   
similar '85 or '86 928S might fit also the bill.

If you've already seen this message here or elsewhere on the WEB, thanks   
for putting up with an encore edition.

Regards,

Rob Stirling.  604 218 1762  robert_stirling@dynapro.com
