I know there is a recurring thread about wheel restoration, and I'm
finishing mine right now.   To cut to the chase, I elected to reburbish
my original/stock phone dials (79 Euro) that were pretty grimey and
would not clean up well enough for a freshly painted car.   After
removal, I wrestled with blasting to get all the years and miles (130k
miles) of dirt and brake dust caked on the backsides.    It was decided
to wash and scrape as well as possible, and go for a durable refinish on
the exposed side.

I used 600 grit sandpaper to rough up the surface and a dinky file to
flatten a few nicks in the aluminum.   The caps got the same treatment
with the crest taped over.   I'm using Wurth's  Silver Lacquer Spray
#892181.........and it looks GREAT!    It's easy to work with, produces
an excellent match and finish, and costs under $10 per can.  This will
be followed by Clear Lacquer #892180 for protection.   The stuff is
formulated for wheels and resists chips and paint dings.   I can't
testify about durability as the wheels aren't installed just yet.

Anyhow, for very little money, I've got new looking wheels!  As always,
YMMV.

PS>   Great going, Moira!   Enjoy!
