For all you clutch/gearbox fans:

I have a faint noise coming from my GT that is somewhat hard to =
describe.  At idle, it's a hydraulic sound, a slight whine maybe?, that =
goes away when the clutch is depressed.  There are no apparent leaks and =
the car runs and drives fine.  When the car was in the dealer for some =
warranty work I asked about it.  The service guy told me that they =
listened to another 928 in the shop and it did the same thing (normal).  =
Is this normal or are they giving me the runaround?  Hopefully someone =
tell me what this noise is so I can take it to another dealer before the =
warranty is up. =20
Please help!?Any thoughts?

Thanks,
-Mike Helman
