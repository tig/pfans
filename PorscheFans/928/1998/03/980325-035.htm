Steve,
I have seen 89s with all leather interior, excluding, Dash, pod, console,
and main door armrest sections (pull handle and actual armrest/lid are
leather).

I have also seen them with just leather seats and roof panel, the rest
vinyl.

Here are a few guidelines based on my experience:

(A) Check edges on sun visors for stitches, if it has them it is leather, in
not it is vinyl (same for rear visors)
(B) Look at the large rear interior panels, if they are stitched along the
areas that run inline with the bottom of your rear quarter glass ( not at
the bottom of the glass but on either end) they are most likely leather

If you have these items, most likely the rest of the interior is leather as
described above.

I have been told by some of the experts that you can test the material by
pressing your fingernail etc. into it (not through it), if it comes back to
normal immediately it is vinyl, if not it is leather (it will take a few
hours to "bounce" back). I have however found this to not be very accurate
in my experience.

Other than pulling the panels and looking on the back side, that is the best
advice I can give you.

After you have stroked a few interiors like I have (I light up afterwards)
you will be able to tell immediately which is which, ;-)
