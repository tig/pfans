Sorry, I paid NO attention to the MY.  I'm such a
newbie I thought they were all the same.

As for the dash - it's shrunk away from the defrost
vents, and as you say, I can see the back-side.  I even
thought the console was leather - but it sounded too
absurd.  It is though. 

When I'm showing off my car I always brag about the
massive amounts of leather.

Also, the rear interior panels are pulling away from
the sides of the car (falling inwards).  The PO said
that the leather option meant that Porsche added extra
leather covered panels on top of the 'stock' vinyl.  Is
this correct?  From what I can see where it's
separating, it looks like he's right.
