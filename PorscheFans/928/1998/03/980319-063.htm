Ooooh, what if's!

Don't know what the sales tax is in TX but here it's 8.5% so means about
$3400 in taxes just to pick up the car.  After biting that bullet I
would consider it my right to break the car in (heh heh) while it goes
up for sale immediately.  

Hey.

Wait a minute.

No, no, no.. the Miata would go up for sale!  Would just about cover the
tax, registration (deductible if any consolation) , first year
insurance, etc.  Not bad 'trade' for a Boxster!

Keep both Sterling!  Then later figure out how to trade/convert Boxster
+ S4 to 6-liter 928 Spyder!?!  My head hurts already!
