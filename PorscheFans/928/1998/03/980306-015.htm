Until you've heard Porsche enunciated by someone
that is truely fluent in German, you'll never
understand.

Even by simply making the word have the proper
two syllable length, we Amurricans still cream
it.

From the only interview that I've ever heard with
an actual engineer from Porsche, the proper
pronunciation sounded (to me) more like

"paw sha"

Of course, he could have been mutilating this as
easily as some student from Washington (that's a
joke, son), but I tend to believe that he was
correct.

BTW - Isn't there a dog breed know as the Jack Russell?
      (that's a joke, son...but does _this_ put any
       more understanding into name mutilation?)
