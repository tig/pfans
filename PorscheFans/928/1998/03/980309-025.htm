It's not supposed to be adjusted; the mounting is supposed to let you flip
up the wing to get at the bottom of the rear window. By the way, what's
your car's serial number? Later '87s have a fixed wing.

This sounds more like a front end aero issue. You need to look for reasons
why too much air is going under the car, making the whole body act like a
right-side-up wing which will lift at speed. Is your air dam intact and in
place? How about your undertray? Also, is it possible that your car is
running slightly nose up (front higher than the rear)?

Yes. Unlike some of the ornamental slats found on more recent cars, this is
a real wing (bulgy on one face, relatively flat on the other). Because the
bulgy face is on the bottom, it gives negative lift. If it's tipped down at
the rear, two undesirable things happen: first, it creates more aero drag
because it presents a large cross section to the air stream. Second, it
makes positive lift as a reaction to directing the air stream down. Level
it off.
