Kevin,
I currently have the center console out of my 1986 928S.  It's not a
terrible job, but I'm not sure you need to go there.  I looked at my
shift selector for a backlight and there is no evidence of there ever
having been a light for this.  I also do not see any backup light switch
under the console at the shift lever.  I am guessing the backup light
switch is somewhere else, like on the transmission. 

I have been able to fix a number of problems with the wiring though
while I am in there.  I have always done my own electrical work and have
taken the time to do things right (IMHO).  I try to find the correct
wires and splice with either a plug connector or solder and heat shrink
tubing.  The people who installed the aftermarket alarm and stereo for
the PO look like they just started cutting wires.  If it was not the
right wire they would use those splice connectors to put it back
together.  There were several wires with 3 or 4 splice connectors within
6 to 8 inches???
Power to the antenna amplifier had just been cut, I think after they~
had sent power to the stereo booster that they intended to go to the ant
amp.  I reconnected the antenna amp wire to switched power and the
reception is much better!  There was also a loose ground that went to
the climate control sliders that was joined at the cigar lighter
ground.  

So anyway, unless I've missed your intentions, I don't think you need to
go under the console.  Unless you just want to.
