Good evening all,

Looks like everyone has enjoyed themselves tonight online, maybe even more
than the normal amount of banter. I have found in the past that many of my
repair questions are asked and explained in this chat forum. For this
reason I keep a copy of each daily list in my "Porsche" file. I however was
not able to find my newest question asked or answered. I have a '81 that
refuses to allow operation of the power mirrors. I originally could only
get the left and right function to work on the driver side and elevation on
the passenger. Thinking in the simplest of terms I ordered two new switches
as they were under $10 each thinking this would solve everything. NOT so, I
now have NO control at all and do not even have power at the fuse ??? I
have racked my brain over the electrical diagram I have on microfiche and
can't make heads or tails of it. If anyone has a suggestion PLEASE let me
know.............
