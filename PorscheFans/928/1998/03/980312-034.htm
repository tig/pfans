     I recently upgraded the stereo system in my '91 GT. I went from the 
     factory Blaupunkt Stuttgart Cassette with 160-watt 6-channel amp and 
     10 speaker system to a JVC CD unit with external USAcoustics 200 watt 
     4-channel amp and a 150 watt amplified Basooka Subwoofer. I originally 
     tried a USAcoustics 400 watt 6-channel with crossovers, but the 
     factory 6.5" bass speakers could not provide decent bass. I considered 
     replacing them, but the Porsche custom mounting seemed limiting. I 
     ended up with a cheaper 4-channel amp and did not even wire up the 
     6.5's. I already had the Bazooka from a previous car so that worked 
     out well. I mounted the amp to the back of the RR seat and have quick 
     disconnects for the Bazooka for removal for auto-x.
     
     I assume there are probably some non-stock and non-Porsche nay-sayers 
     about my choice of equipment, but the JVC unit is pretty slick. It has 
     a 3-disk CD cassette that is contained within the Euro-DIN slot so I 
     did not have to add an external changer(requires an external amp). 
     Germans engineer the best cars, but the Japanese have excelled in 
     electronics. 
     
     Now for some requests for help. The Blaupunkt had a white wire going 
     to the antenna and the wiring diagram in the workshop manual shows 
     what appears to be an amplier at the antenna (I am a Mechanical 
     Engineer so bear with me please). I remember reading some postings 
     about some cars having a power amplified antenna. I am assuming that I 
     now need to connect the white wire to a 12 volt supply. Should this 
     connect to the remote lead(blue wire) coming from the CD player? If 
     so, will this handle 3 loads as it is already connected to 2 
     amplifiers?
     
     I also have a slight hiss that increases amplitude and frequency with 
     RPM's. I plan to try different grounding locations. I connected power 
     and ground to wires originating from the wiring harness of the factory 
     amp beside the passenger seat per the factory wiring diagram so I 
     didn't have to chase wires and go around the factory alarm and relay 
     connections. Does anyone have alternate wiring suggestions?
     
     The system currently sounds great except for the hiss and mediocre 
     radio reception. Looking for further improvements. TIA.
