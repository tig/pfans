Ok, I finally got it. And my only road kill has been a GMC Jimmy, so
leave me alone!!! 

It's an '87 928 S4 5 speed, black/black. It's in pretty good shape.
There is some stuff not working, but it wouldn't be a 928 if everything
was working. This car is amazing. I have never shifted through the gears
like this. The brakes are pretty wild too. Everyone always asks about
speed, but they don't realize that a Porsche is about a lot more than
speed.

This car is like night and day compared to the 911. All those hours of
lifting weights and now I have power steering. The two look pretty good
parked in the garage next to each other.

Every new owner gets one stupid question, so here's mine...
Where is the motor noise in the back coming from, fuel pump? And if I
can hear it, is it too loud?? is there something wrong with it??? Ok
that was three questions.

I'll be back with more annoying questions when I get the sh*t-eating
grin off my face. Till then...Moira
