Friends, disaster has just struck.  I took my '79 Black 0n Black 928 over to
my Porsche mechanic to fix a small oil leak, and he said it is the rear main
seal, with attendant soaking of the clutch.  Oil was everywhere inside the
housing at the back of the engine.  I am looking at over $3000 to get it back
on the road, just to start with.  The car has 61,000 original miles on the 
clock, and I have paid attention to the mechanicals.  The body needs a coat
of paint, the leather dash is shot, the AC worketh not (charging is in order).
The transmission needs the usual synchros, but all the teeth are there.  The
body has never been bent, the engine has never been overheated and is working
very well.  The Timing belt was recently replaced, as was the water pump and
the alternator. The battery and tires are new. All belts are less than four 
years old, and many of the main hoses have been replaced. The outside door 
handles are new.  All the glass is good, and the windows work. I can give you
the name and number of my mechanic, who has worked on the car for quite a few
years. The entire exhaust was replaced (ANSA) 5 years ago, and has not had many
miles on it. 

The car is a work of art, runs very well and sounds even better with the new
exhaust, but I have run out of money and commitment.  It is time for someone
else to pick up the torch.  If anybody out there is interested, give me a call.
I need to get $6000 out of it.
