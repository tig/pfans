>>Folks,

Looks like I'm gonna be taking the center console out this weekend.  My 
reverse lights do not work and the back light for the selector on the 
console is not working.   Any helpful hints or warnings when undertaking 
this?

Kevin,

I noted your post of a couple days ago regarding your reverse light problem.
Maybe you have figured it out by now. If not, try this.

I also had no reverse lights in my '86 auto and found the problem. I assume
you have already checked the switch on the transmission & the switch
connector. If not, it is located on the left side of the transmission. The
reverse contacts on the switch are 81 and 81a. they need to be made to turn on
the backup lights as well as the "R" in your instrument pod. Make sure the
switch works first. Those were
good on my car, but still no back up lights.

The problem was an electrical connector located in the forward part of the
spare wheel well on the right side (the right forward corner of the well). You
will have to remove a cover to see the connector. One side of the connector
goes to a cable that runs through a grommet/seal and down to the transmission.
The other side connects to a cable that goes forward to the instrument cluster
& fuse box. While the connector did not seem dirty or corroded, cleaning it
and making sure the connectors fit tightly together solved the problem.
