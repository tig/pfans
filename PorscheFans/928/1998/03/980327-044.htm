My passenger seat was stuck when I first bought my S4. So was the elec.
sunroof, for that matter. Both were fixed with some highly scientific,
precision administered, (how shall I put this) sharp blows: the palm of
my hand while pushing the "open" switch (in the case of the sunroof) and
with both feet from the rear seat while  pushing the "forward" switch
(in the case of the passenger seat). I don't know how the other listers
will react to my methods, but within reasonable limits, this has proven
a viable "first option". My 928 had sat unused for a period of time
prior to sale and apparently some mechanisms just became balky. Once
freed, they've exibited no more balkiness.

Being 6'-3", the seat proceedure is also a good warm up for the "fun
with another" in a 928 that others have been alluding to lately.
