Happy Friday 13th!  Hopefully it will warm up around here this weekend! 
I guess the "bugs" withthe list have been fixed?  Anyway, hope everyone
has a good weekend.  I wanted to post an "ad" for a 928 that is for sale
through me - the only problem is that it is in CA.  I do have pics and
full info about the car.  Thought it may be a good chance for someone
out west to get a very nice car.  Info is below.  In a very short while
I won't have such a long E-sig, as Mike Somerville is currently working
on my web page!  It is coming along very nicely, but I can't give out
the address just yet.  I'll let everyone know when it is "open."
