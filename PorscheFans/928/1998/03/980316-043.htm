Evening all,
I was out doing a little business today and I pulled up behind a very nice
slate gray
928 S2 at a traffic lights, when the lights turned green I watched him
disapear into the distance leaving me chugging along in the BMW 525i (yawn).
What a nice start to the day I thought as you dont see too many 928's around
do you?

Later in the day I went to a friend's place to help him to test drive his
911 (yawn again, just joking) as he is having a bit of trouble so I rode
along behind with tow rope at the ready in case he ran out of wind, get it?
Anyway as we drove along we passed a very nice silver metalic 928 S parked
outside a house, not bad I thought two 928's in one day+ACE-

Test driving completed succesfully we retired to a colleague's house for
much deserved refreshment. As I was driving home later coming up on a trafic
lights I saw familiar tail lights in the distance, I pulled up alongside
this lovely burgundy 928 GT beeped the horn and we gave each other the
thumbs up and departed the scene at a respectable pace.

So three 928's in one day and all within 10 kilometers of each other, a
thoroughly refreshing day+ACE-
