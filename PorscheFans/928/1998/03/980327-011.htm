Brake fluid yes, others if needed - your tranny might get really hot
depending on how you drive your first time so you could go with some
synthetic (Red-Line NS for example).  On brake fluid, I know at least
one good driver who use the LMA and so I doubt it's the problem for Tony
(I use ATE SuperBlue/Gold though).  More likely, I suspect water (i.e.
old fluid) in the clutch and/or ABS systems.  It's easy to bleed the
clutch with a pressure bleeder so do that.  Prolly you don't have ABS on
an '85 - if you do, bleed the brakes now, use the car for a month or so
(and maybe the ABS), and then bleed again.  That way, you'll get most of
the grunchy fluid out of the ABS unit too.

This is much more important.  Have the car ready days in advance.  Be
well rested and relaxed.

When your instructor gets in the car, you first words should certainly
be:
"Hi, I'm Ed.  This is my first time at the track and I want to see if I
can set a new lap record by the end of the day."  Then proceed to
completely ignore whatever he says 'cause he's prolly not a very good
driver.

That's probably not what you were thinking but you probably think you
will go pretty fast.  Forget about speed!  You may think you know the
line around the track.  That's fine, however you may find it's a lot
harder driving the line than just knowing it.  Your first day, you just
want to learn the line and pick up the etiquette of being at the track.
Don't worry about not doing things correctly - that's why you have your
friendly instructor sitting next to you.  If he's not being friendly,
don't hesitate to get one who is.  If the second isn't friendly either,
then maybe you should alter your approach.  Once you learn the line, the
consistency and then speed will come so naturally it's really hard to
believe.

Take it seriously and enjoy it!
