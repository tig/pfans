Dear 928 fans:

You are absolutely correct, since that information is in print in lots of
places. However, if in 1987 the S4 was introduced, then by logic and
deduction, the 1986 US models were S3s without that official designation.
Last time I checked, "4" was preceeded by "3". I realize that there is an
"S" as a designation on my 86' and not an "S3." But so what? Isn't anyone
curious as to why the S4 was named as such? Why wasn't it named the S2?
There obviously were internal factory designations that finally manifested
themselves in 1987.

Besides, does it all really matter? Happy motoring. Ed
