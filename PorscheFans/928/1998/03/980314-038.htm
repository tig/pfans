I just changed my transmission oil and added Amsoil synthetic oil, and it
makes a huge difference from what I had before. The shifter 'slpo' is gone and
it shifts easier and smoother than before. I am now going to be changing the
Clutch Master Cylinder and would like to know the process to accomplish it. If
anyone has any help on ow to fix it I'd appreaciate it. Also, should I change
the clutch slave also? 

I checked the ball joints and they were steel in the middle! Magnet stuck to
it...
Was also wondering how many of you have ripped off or damaged their front
lower spoiler on the earlier models, just wondering, only just damaged
mine.....

thanks a lot,
matt
