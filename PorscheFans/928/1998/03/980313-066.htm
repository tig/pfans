Phil/Dave...

Look, I don't want you to think that my post on thread lubrication means that
I'm suggesting that you don't lube the wheel studs.  All I'm saying is that
the torque should be applied to bolts/studs as directed by the manufacturer.

A very common misconception is that it 's better to lubricate a thread so that
it turns smoothly to get a more accurate torque reading.  That's only true if
the thread is supposed to be lubricated.  And Phil, if you add 10% to the
specified torque value and lubricate threads that are specifically called out
to be dry, you will definitely exceed the bolt/stud stretch specified by the
manufacturer.  Whether this turns out to be a problem or not will depend on
lots of factors.

In my case, I generally torque to the low value specified, never the high
value, especially if I have applied lubricant to the threads.  But even then
the torque will end up being on the high side if the bolt/nut was supposed to
be fitted dry.  And MOST fasteners are spec'd dry.
