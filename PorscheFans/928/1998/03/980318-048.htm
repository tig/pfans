Hey guys,

I'm looking for some help with the Cruise control and possible source of
intake leak and location of the O2 sensor plug on my '86 928 S.  I am
enjoying this car, it is currently snowing like crazy (2+ feet) and will
have some time to work on the car.  Snow will be gone by Sunday I hope.  

Is there a good source for the tool to adjust the CO?  I looked at the
local parts place and did not see an appropriate tool.

I checked the cruise control hoses for vacumn leaks.  The only hose that
will not hold vacumn out of the test tee goes into the firewall, for the
ventilation control flaps I think.  

1. Is there an easy way to get to where this vacumn hose goes?  Can I
just remove the carpeted panel on the passenger side to gain access to
the vacumn hoses inside the car?    

2.  Where is the connector plug for the O2 sensor?  The shop manuals say
it is either under the pass side carpet of in the fuse box panel.  I did
not see it either place.   I had a local shop adjust the CO and he said
he could only get it up to .3%, should be .6% +2 according to the shop
manuals.  He also said he could not find the O2 plug so adjusted the CO
without unplugging the sensor.  My understanding of the LH injection
system is that by not unplugging the O2 sensor the CO could probably not
be adjusted, the brain would just keep changing the injector pulse width
to what it thought it needs to be.  The car does run better now when
warm, but worse when cold.  
According to the Bosch fuel managment book I may have a false air leak
problem.  The fuel pressure works as the book says, I have not checked
the flow volume yet.  Anyone have any info on common false intake air
leak locations?

3. There is a small metal tab on the left fender just inside of the
shock mount or attacked to the inboard shock mounting bolt.  There is
evidence of something being attached here, but nothing now.  Any idea of
what may have been connected here or is this maybe a aftermarket thing.

Hoping to dig out of the snow tomorrow.
