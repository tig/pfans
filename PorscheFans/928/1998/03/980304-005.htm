We've had this discussion before.  The correct weapon is the AIM-9L.

The "L" variant of the AIM 9 missle system was an infrared seeker equipped
air to air missle that had true all aspect capability.  It was quite light,
relatively, and although, due to the IR seeker head was much more accurate
on side or rear aspect targets, it was good enough to have a high pk
(probability of kill) on front aspect in most altitude bands.

The obvious advantage is that not only will it clear the interstate in front
of the obnoxious blue-hair aimed, chronic left turn frozen luxobarges, but
as an added benefit, it will also provide ultimate protection from those
fast moving rear approaching vehicles that you don't want to talk with.....

Besides, as I previously indicated, the wiring is already in place for the
heads up display in the later model 928 with digital readout.

Of course, it will mean that your 928 isn't "pure" German, but I will
suggest that for the "ultimate" 928, it may not matter.  After all, if the
Germans were all that good, they would have won the war, and this message
would be in German.
