Jim,
Yes the exhaust changed on the 86.5 928. The exit point is the same as early
86 and down, but the pipe layout is that of the S4. That is why the 86.5 has
the smaller battery box like the S4s, the right exhaust pipe curves from the
right side to the left in between the transaxle and the battery box just
like an S4.
85 and early 86 928s had the dual exhaust that followed the same path as the
16v single exhaust.

That is why there are currently 2 versions of the Rear Muffler Bypass. One
for 86.5s and one for S4 and up.
The other 2 versions are soon to follow ;-)

For those of you who attended the VA Frenzy you saw this clearly on Ed
Ruiz's 86.5 928 when it was up on the rack. As a matter of fact Ed had one
of the 86.5 Rear Muffler Bypasses on his car.(at least I think it was Ed's,
correct me again Ed if I am wrong)
