Steve,
In defense of Porsche batteries if you have looked closely at my message you
would have seen:

"(actually my fault from non use of car and too many repeated charges from
leaving doors open while detailing etc.). "

When I say repeated drains and charges from misuse, I mean as many times a 4
or 5 a day. Repeated many days in a row (not smart, but it happened). No
battery will take that type of abuse.
I have Porsche batteries in all my Porsche's (even use a spare one to start
my Lawn Tractor), the only 2 failures that I have ever made was under the
circumstances described above.

I think we should all trash Porsche parts a little more so maybe they will
stop making 928 parts for us. When the day comes that you cannot get a motor
mount etc. for your 928, don't come crying to me.

A very serious example just happened to me 2 days ago. I was told that due
to me ordering some new motor mounts at Jim Ellis Porsche this kept the
motor mount part number active on the computer, it was getting ready to be
dropped from the parts list for non-activity. SCARY!!

From a multiple Porsche owner that loves to be taken by THE COMPANY THAT
MANUFACTURED SUCH A GREAT SPORTS CAR,  of course I could be taken by a bunch
of Auto Zones, Sears etc. they will surely keep making those replacement
parts that I need for the next millennium.
