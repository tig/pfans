No, you don't; there ain't no such thing.

If it were really going out of gear, the engine would take off and hit the
rev limiter, particularly if you gave it throttle. However, you might, just
might, want to check for the presence (let alone correct level) of ATF in
the transmission. There might be just a teensy shortage, exacerbated by
hard cornering. This could affect the torque converter (loss of coupling)
or the hydraulic computer that controls the transmission (won't work if
there's no fluid in it).

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's not an S4.
