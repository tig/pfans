I agree with the statement that heat will cause epoxies to failure in a
short period of time.  Epoxies do many things well, but they do have
their Achilles' heel as well.  Heat will cause epoxies to fail.  As
temperature rises above ambient air,  like in a coolant system or the
environment under your cars hood, epoxies will soften and release their
hold on bonded surfaces.  This is why a window washing reservoir will do
well, while a coolant tank may fail under the same hood.  Epoxies are
also vulnerable to attack from petrochemicals fuels (like gasoline).
Another consideration is the type of "Plastic" used on the unit.  Where
PVC is somewhat easy to work, other formula's such as "nylon" or
polyethylene do not accept repairs well at all.  It is also true that
plastic components will heat age as well and become brittle over time,
especially in the engine bay.  It may be worth a try to heat weld the
plastic to seal a crack if you are skilled with a heating or soldering
gun with the correct tip.  Be Careful with any heat source used under
the hood of your car.  Our "old" Porsche's are legend on having oozing
combustible petrochemical liquids.  I agree that the best approach other
than buying factory new is to buy a salvaged unit or if you feel exotic
have one fabricated of aluminum and anodized in an exotic color, maybe
match your car color!!!  

I would not recommend using copper in a coolin system with aluminum
components.  The potential electrolytic chemical reaction would create a
corrosion potential on any less noble, "Aluminum" components in the
coolant stream.  This includes the entire engine assembily.  What ever
copper may already be present is in balance.  Adding more could cause a
serious problem. 

Good Luck
