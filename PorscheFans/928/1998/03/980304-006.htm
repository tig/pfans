Watch out for the KBB web site for older sharks. It does not give an
enthusiasts price or make any allowances for condition other than normal
wear. Sharks tend to be more highly regarded than other autos and IMHO are
"normally" better cared for and have lower average miles than other cars of
similar vintage. If you find a good car it might be worth more to you than
an average book value. There are also some toads out there that have been
hoon thrashed (should that be hyphenated) that you wouldn't give a $1k for.

I use KBB, NADA and EDMUNDS all the time to assess values for myself and
others. They are good sources but our cars are a specialty item. So do your
homework.
