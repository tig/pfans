Mark has final muffler bypass pipes for the '86?  I thought
these were n/a for now due to side vs. rear exit point... 
Am wondering if you got the cat bypass instead.  Those
(Y-pipe cat replacement) are much louder than the muffler
bypass as I recall with my '84.

Yes it is louder than stock (what I was seeking) but
definately tame in comparison to sport exhaust setups,
especially the single race muffler types.  Inside the car is
pretty quiet also.  I believe the '85 - '86 have the dual
cat, dual primary resonators so there shouldn't much
difference between those and my car (pipe ID/OD same,
etc.).  David do you have info on this?

Truth be told, I hardly ever listen to the stereo!  Maybe on
a longish trip with a passenger but otherwise I tune into
the mechanical noises of the car (including the incessant
bleep-bleep of the locks, hey wait a minute I haven't heard
that since the bypass installed!) I am a sick puppy no?

Beautiful!  Time to hit the track - an AX will be too many
short bursts to get the full effect, only a nice long run at
higher revs, turns and shifts included will come close to
show us all just how incredibly sweet the Porsche V8 really
is!  (This works with stock pipes too)

Not yet.  Might dyno eventually but first test of the mettle
will be when Sears resumes Wednesday night Sportsman drags
in April.  Track rules dictate mufflers for street cars but
I'm sure the cats & primary mufflers will suffice.  Track
opens at 3pm, qualifying at 4 or so, eliminations at 7, all
wrapped up, err, finished by 10.  $17 to run.  Anyone else
want to plan a roadtrip to Sears?  'specially you automatic
(deadly consistent, what you want in a bracket racer) and/or
monster motor cars?  Paul C. are you there?

Otherwise...  13's or bust! (ouch, maybe not quite that gung
ho)
Phil Tong

ps. what's the animal count up to now?  We have your coyote,
an egret or something and...?

There are many seagulls around here that play chicken
(standing) with cars & kites (flying) but I heard they have
great memory like elephants and I don't want to be on their
bomb raid list!
