Dear John and fellow "Land Shark" tamers:
    The U.S. 86.5 (and the U.S. 85 and 86 models) have the 288 HP engine.
The heads, valves and intake manifolds (among other things) were changed in
87 to improve the HP and torque.
    Contrary to your understanding, the 85 & 86 models can be chipped. Those
models (and later ones as well) take two chips, one for timing and the other
for fuel delivery. AutoThority makes a good set.

Happy motoring. Ed
