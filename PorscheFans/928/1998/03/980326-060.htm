Recently I've seen some posts regarding the so called "Magic Blower
Syndrome", didn't pay close attention to them because I hadn't experienced
that particular ailment with any of my 928s.  A few weeks ago my AC suddely
started blowing full blast of its' own accord.

Remembering the previous posts, I told my mechanic that the cause was
probably in the control box under the hood, and that most likely there were
corroded contact points etc. etc.

He got into  the box containing the aforesaid points and they were, indeed,
rusted and/or corroded.  He cleaned them up at no charge, and I drove about
twenty miles before the whole thing happened again.

I gather that this  is a fairly common problem.  I'd appreciate those of
you who've experienced this malady to let me know what the final cure was.

Thanks

Gene O'Rourke
