FYI, The SP4000s have been discontinued, I had to purchase a set of SP8000s.
At least that is what the  tire salesman told me. I got 4 SP8000s for $450
mounted and balanced. Nice tires, I was partial to Bridgestones until they
kept wearing out so quickly. Dunlops holding up great. Noe for new shocks
and an alignment!

For Tom Weigand:
My requirements for tires are that they cover a variety of weather
conditions, because I use the 928 year round.  I am on the coast of Maine,
where our winters are, well, challenging at least.
I put new tires on the car in the fall, and after MUCH debate and hand
wringing, I chose Dunlop SP4000 all season (Z rated).  The choice was either
those or Yokohama AVS S4.  The all season rating was the driving factor,
because after the first of October we often won't see ambient temperatures
above 45 for six months.  Softer compounds become like concrete, and add a
little moisture to the pavement and you can have sideways Shark.
