Glenn,

It sounds like there could any number of problems here.  A jumped TB
tooth would cause what you describe, but I don't think it would ping. 
Pinging is usually related to the ignition being too far advanced.  Your
car uses the LH system, which is the same as my euro 84.  There is no
way for you to advance the ignition, as the LH uses the distributor only
as just that, to distribute the high voltage.  The spark advance is
controlled by the computer alone.

Is it possible that the car is running extremely lean?  Be certain that
the main fuel pump is running.  How old is the fuel filter?  Shitty gas
will clog it up quickly.  Had this happen to a Volvo Turbo Wagon.

A bad coil is possible, but again, I don't think this would cause
pinging.

Good luck,

Mark
