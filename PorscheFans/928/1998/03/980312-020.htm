"I did not get an overwhelming response the first time on the 
list ( maybe I can't take a hint). I did replace the radio in my 
86 928s with  a  Blaupunkt Denver ( single CD) with remote from 
Crutchfield. The  installation was much more difficult.................."

I'm a little late but here's my input.

I've retrofitted a Lexington into my 85. The Lexington has 4 power amp 
outputs as well as a low level output from the DIN connector. In my case 
the low level output feeds the low level input of the existing power amp 
that then drives the speakers. With the original radio and setup the 2 
speaker outputs went to the 4 high level inputs on the power amp via the 
fader by the drivers seat. The speaker outputs were ground referenced 
which is to say that one of each of the speaker wire pairs is connected 
to ground as is the power amp inputs. The same is true for all low level 
input and outputs I've ever seen so no problems there. The Lexington does 
not have ground referenced power amp outputs. The output is a bridge 
configuration and neither side can be connected to ground. Damage would 
be the likely out come. This is pretty much true for all newer radios as 
well. If you have to use this type of output with a power amp an 
"isolator" of some sort is required. If you have a low level output 
that's the one you should be using to the feed to the power amp however. 
Lower cost (just the cable) better performance!

In my case, if I want to add more speakers, all I have to do is hook up 
to the currently unused power amp outputs on the Lexington and Voila, 8 
amplifiers all trying to burst my eardrums. It works well, I've tried it. 
No relays, no adaptors, no hassle, no room for the 4 extra speakers.
