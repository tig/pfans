Hi John,

I agree with your statement about reducing torque when tightening lubricated
threads.

Many moons ago, I was a Huey helicopter mechanic in the Army. Certain
applications on the aircraft called for a "castle-ated" self locking nut. This
is a nut with square slots for a cotter key AND a plastic insert for redundant
retention. These were one-time-use fasteners since threads would be formed
into the plastic insert upon installation. The installation process called to
install these nuts hand tight onto the threaded shaft until the plastic made
contact with the threads. With a torque wrench, determine the torque required
to overcome "forming threads" into the plastic insert. This value was ADDED to
the nominal torque value given for that application.

Since the extra torque was added when friction was increased (forming threads
into the plastic), it follows that torque should be reduced when friction has
been decreased.

Thanks,
