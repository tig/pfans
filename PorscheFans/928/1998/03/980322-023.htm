Aloha Ed-

Forwarding your post to the 928 list, which I heartily recommend you
join at http://www.porschefans.com - it's everything a 928 fan could
hope for on the net!

Also, see http://www.928intl.com and get on Mark's mailing list
immediately - there's a special announcement coming up soon regarding
club stuff.

See you on the list!
