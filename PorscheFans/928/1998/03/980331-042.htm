to the person looking to have his injectors rebuilt.  

Send them to Marren motorsports

They have a web site.  They ONLY do injectors.  if I remember corectly for my
86 s
it was 28 dollars a piece with all the o ring+ rebuild kits include.  They are
very proffessional, about 2-3 days to turn them around.  They will flow check
them before and after.  they will keep cleaning them until they are correct.

Number your injectors by scribing them to identify the location, or they will
randomly assign numbers to them.  I only used marren once, but I really liked
them.

About my serious motor problems.  A guy I work for part time that own his own
porsche repair shop said after driving it . it was either a vac leak or my hot
wire airflow sensor.   How much will this set me back   New vs used?

I will check the car more closely this weekend.

Thanks
