  I bought my last belt and wp mail order from Sonnen Motors, a Porsche
  dealership in Calif.  Sorry, I don't have their 800# handy, but they 
  advertise in Excellence.  The wp I bought was a PCNA rebuild that cost 
  around $109/exchange and came with a two year warranty.  The belt was 
  Porsche OEM and cost around $45.
  
  Labor to install both on my 2-valve was around $600 at an independent
  Porsche shop I use.
  
  The oil and antifreeze will need to be changed when doing the t-belt
  and wp, so that is a good time to step up to the Porsche 5-year antifreeze
  and a good synthetic oil.  Also have the mechanic check whether any cam
  seals are leaking since you might as well replace them while everything
  is apart.
