Hi Jim,

I'm posting your private email 'cause I'm pretty sure you won't mind.

Piece o' cake to mount the Sparco (Pro 2000).  They have an adaptor kit
for
the 928 but Bob @ OG Racing recomended I just buy the Sparco seat tracks
($40
per seat) and then fab a mount to the existing.  Got some 1/8" x 1"
steel from
Home Depot ($6 for both seats) - drilled 4 holes and you're in (and
nearly as
low as you can with seat tracks).  (Make sure you use high grade
bolts!)  This
gave me about 1.5" more headroom.  The nice thing is, the sparco track
have a
smaller width but the same spacing front/rear hole spacing as 2 of the
factory
holes so the cross pieces can be fairly narrow.

The Pro2000 is a NARROW seat - this makes it easy to put in & out -
easier
than the stock electric seat at least.

As for mounting the belts, I used the outside 3 pt belt anchor for the
outside
lap belt.  H strap mounted to harness bar connecting rear shock towers
(being
fabbed - Devek's will be  ready in a few weeks for $125 ??).  For the
sub
belt, I drilled through the floor where one of the sheet metal
reinforcements
is for the floor pan and used some large backing washers.  Sub-belt
clips in
and out.  For the S4's, the 3 pt receiver is mounted to the seat so I
had to
drill another hole through the tunnel and reinforce with a very large
thick
washer (this belt really matters as compared to the anti-sub belt).  I
used
bolt in's for the lap belts - for the outside belt, the e-brake will get
in
the way of a clip-in belt.  Doesn't matter for me as I won't be swapping

seats.

If you drive your car everyday, you don't want to have to get in & out
of such
a seat.  I didn't believe other people who've written this.  You don't
have to
believe me either but you will.  Some of the other seats may be better
than
the Pro 2000 - I would never get my wallet out of my back pocket while
sitting
in this one.  I think I'll like it on the track though!

So 2 holes in sheet metal and 1 in the carpet (& insulation).  Not so
bad.
Kurt
'87 S4 (we'll try it next weekend @ Lime Rock)
