Instead of using "ordinary" epoxies off the hardware store rack, why not
try an epoxy that's as exotic as the car.  There are several aerospace
epoxies that are used for composite aircraft(remember the Voyager
around-the-world-without-refueling aircraft) construction.  These are
usually used to "wet out" fiberglass or carbon fiber cloth.  Use a small
swath of fiberglass for backing and the result will be very strong and
fairly flexible.  They are impervious to fuels(they're used in fuel tank
construction) and fairly resistant to heat(used in aircraft engine
cowling construction).  

I'd try a small amount in an inconspicuous place first before committing
to a full-scale patch to be sure the resin is compatible with the
underlying plastic.  The caveat is that I haven't done this - it's just
a suggested alternative to "common" epoxies.  I *have* successfully used
JB Weld epoxy over fiberglass drywall tape to patch plastic interior
panels back together(Detroit stuff).

For more info about aerospace epoxies and other goodies that rival
Porsche parts in price, go to:

A free catalog(which has some neat info on composites) is available -
just follow the links.
