Guys...

I'm still sipping the medicinal Cognac as I write this...

It was too horrible, I though"t I'd seen it all...I've been about, I've 
seen a few things in my 28 years, "Animal Farm" all that...

But I just saw on British television the most foul depraved and 
disgusting scene in a film, I just had to warn you guys, don't watch 
this film, ever, it will haunt your dreams...

"The Rookie" (1990) - they killed a 928!   They intentionally pushed a 
928 off a car transporter, and the poor (sniff sniff) driverless car 
totalled into a crash barrier...

It's no good I can't type anymore...I need to lie down, where's my 
tablets, bring me the producer's head...I say we form a possie and hunt 
this man down like a dog...

drive!)
