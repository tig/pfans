I have an older 928 and when I bought it it had an oil seal problem. The
fossil oil smoked profusely. Prior to getting the seals fixed I was told to
put synthetic in and VIOLA, the smoking stop (The Mobil1 did not smoke under
high temperature.) I do not think synthetic cause problems in older 928's,
this has not been my experience synthetic oil, I believe that the oil seals
were in need of change anyway. I ran around on Mobil1 and leaky seals for a
month (no Problem, except replenishing a quart of Mobil1 every week.)

my

mounted

and

amps

>With the original hookup to the headlights, I measured 12.5 V and 9.5 amps
at

>After installing the relays with the more direct current source, I measured

now

>The extra 19 watts (9.5 per headlight) dissipated in the headlights was
hardly

expense.
