First thing you need is a set of manuals.  It's about $300, but if you
don't
have them, you're going to get stumped again and again, or give MORE
money
to the dealer.

Horn is in front of the right front wheel, behind the splash panel.

>>Also, how do you check a relay to see if it is defective ? 

Run power through the switching connections (there's a diagram on the
plastic
body, usually).  Continuity-test the other terminals with an ohmmeter or
a buzzer
or light.
