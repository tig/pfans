Having obtained a 928 in December I have been following this list for a
short period and found it very rewarding.  This is my first chance for a
posting and hope it is of interest.

Firstly I wish to thank Wally Plumley for his very detailed instructions on
fan clutch repair and also to Andrew Smallwood for his comments.  You can
find these on the 6 February 1998 digest.

I followed the procedure of removing the whole fan unit, cleaning up the
front face, placed the whole lot in a vice so the fan could rotate, eased
loose the bi-metal strip( after marking its position), removed the metal
rod (about 3mm dia and 10mm long), removed the grommet.
On rotating the fan while heating it with a hot air gun air started to come
out of the 3mm hole (where the rod had been removed) it made some small
bubbles and continued for some while until I got bored.  I then removed the
heat and dripped the silicone fluid into hole, while rotating the fan; the
cooling of the air inside sucks the silicone in.  I repeated this heating
and cooling twice and got the whole bottle of silicone into the fan.  It
probably would have taken more.

Before the repair the temp gauge, in traffic, was at the top white mark and
sometimes just above.  On highway running it was just under this mark. The
mark on my car is at 2/3 of gauge.

After repair the needle ranges from a just over 1/3 (40%) on cool day to
just under 2/3 (60%) in traffic with air temp about 30c.


There are a couple of things I'm not clear on:

1	Can you fill the clutch until you can't get any more silicone into it ?
Mate at work thinks you shouldn't.

2	Where should the temp gauge indication sit normally ?

The job took me a Saturday morning and the silicone cost $A10.

A fan clutch costs $A500 plus labour!
