I used to detail cars and a trick that we used to get swirl marks out was 
to buff (using an orbital buffer) the car with dry corn starch after 
removing the oxidization.  It is a pretty messy job and it will take a 
couple of washings to get the corn starch out of the nooks and crannies of 
the car, but the shine is worth it.

Anytime you use an orbital buffer, especially electric, you should be very 
careful to avoid applying any pressure.  Do not keep it in any one spot, 
always move the buffer.  Never stop or apply pressure to edges.  Using dry 
corn starch is much less dangerous than rubbing compound because it is a 
much finer abrasive than what is in the rubbing compound.

To deoxidize the paint use a chemical cleaner, not an abrasive 
cleaner(dupont #7 auto polish and cleaner is what I use).  This can be 
applied with or without an orbital buffer, if you are inexperienced with 
buffers I would suggest doing this step by hand.

After you have deoxidized, buffed with corn starch, and washed all excess 
corn starch and polish off you can apply a coat of good wax (I use pure 
carnuba, but there are plenty of good waxes on the market), this will keep 
your car from oxidizing as quickly.

Some detail shops use what is known as a 'clay bar' to remove contaminates, 
I am not familiar with these.

Hope this helps and if you have any questions, let me know.  Also let me 
throw in a short disclaimer:  If you are in any way uncomfortable with 
doing this job yourself, have a professional do it, a good detail job is a 
lot cheaper than a good paint job.

Happy Buffing!
