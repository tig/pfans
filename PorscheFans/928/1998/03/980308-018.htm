>1. Did all 89 S4's have the '928 S4' sticker on the rear bumper cover?

Maybe not, since there is an option code (check your build sticker) 302 for
"928 S4 name tag on rear"; this implies that some cars were built without a
sticker. Badgeless cars are not uncommon in Germany, but may be rare in the
US.

Yes. Open up the tool compartment (by turning the knobs to remove the
carpeted vertical panel at the rear of the "trunk") and take a good look
therein. Unless it developed legs, you'll probably see a jack nestled in a
deep recess.

>3. What are the torque values for the lug nuts?

According to the factory spec book (which, by the way, clearly identifies
the material of the lug nuts as aluminum and the size as M 14 x 1.5), the
proper torque is 130 Nm (= 95 lb ft).
