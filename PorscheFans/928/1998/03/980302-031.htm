What is the definition of "non-Porsche" Porsches. The ad-hoc P-scale:

(All higher scale ratings are [mostly] inclusive of lower scale mod's.)

10  - Non-Porsche engine
9.5 - Non-928 engine
9   - Forced Air/Nitrous, etc
8   - Stroker kit
7   - Different seats, shifter, etc
6   - Headers
5   - Cat removal
4   - Muffler
3   - Shocks, sway-bar
2   - Wheels
1   - K&N Air filter
0   - Stock Factory

(Rating '9.5' is just in keeping with recent posts on the list.)

 So, when we all call each other on "bastardizing" our cars, it is really 
just a matter of where you draw the line; it's all quite gray.  I doubt 
but maybe 2% of us could claim a '0' rating.
