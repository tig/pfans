Hey all,
Just wanted to drop a line and tell everyone that I got to meet a 928
P-Fan on Sat.  Andrew Smallwood drove up to Evansville on Sat and we
went out to lunch and goofed around town a little bit.  A very nice guy
who is currently writing a movie script as well as TV shows for sit coms
(although his degree is criminal justice).  Although he's currently
driving a Supra (we won't hold it against him), he is wanting to buy a
928 but needs to get a steady weekly salary type job first.  Anyone out
there in the criminal justice field looking for someone?  Anyway, just
thought you'd all like to know that all the P-Fans aren't on the east
and west coasts!
Regards,
