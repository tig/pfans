I would like to praise Mr. Tong for his seminal work:

"On the Removal, Disassembly and Re-establishment of Lighting of the Climate
Control Unit".

The results of this work are all reproducible.


After replacing the light bulb my center flap did not work. I check that
the blue vacuum check valve was working and all connections to
Climate Control Unit were fine. Without really knowing what I
was doing I decided to interrupt the red vacuum line, at a point were
it is joined by a one inch black tube, just to see if there was some
suction. There was none. The colored coded pipes are accessible by removing
the carpeted cover
to the right of the driver's foot well. After reconnecting the red pipe the
flaps started working again!  Don't ask me why!  Maybe a vacuum switch
was stuck and needed to vent or pressurize?

I also worked on my antenna. The antenna mast was not retracting completely.
The antenna is easily accessible by removing a cover behind the left rear
tire. The antenna has a dented plastic core that is driven by a dented pulley.
The dents on the last section of the plastic core have worn out. The plastic
core is slipping. Using a Dremel I will try to scribe some grooves on the core
to restore friction between the pulley and plastic core. Otherwise the antenna
mast can be replaced (I am trying to save $40 dls).
