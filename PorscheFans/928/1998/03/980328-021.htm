A wise choice.

Such as?

>Where is the motor noise in the back coming from, fuel pump?

Probably. A healthy fuel pump makes a steady buzzing sound that's clearly
audible when you stand outside an idling car. The pump is under the fuel
tank, basically just inside the right rear wheel, so move around to be sure
that what you hear is coming from there.

>if I can hear it, is it too loud?? is there something wrong with it???

Probably not. The pump works harder if there is an obstruction (e.g.,
clogged filter) or a restraint to fuel flow (e.g., non-functional tank
venting), which will make the buzz louder and "angrier", but this typically
requires running the car for a while to bring out. The fuel filter may be
due for a change anyway (what do you know of the car's service history?),
and tank venting should be OK if you don't get a "whoosh" when you remove
the gas cap after consuming most of a tank, or have trouble getting the
tank truly full.

>I'll be back with more annoying questions...

Don't hesitate.

>...when I get the sh*t-eating grin off my face.

That may be a while. You'll be doing quite a bit of driving before this car
becomes pass=E9.
