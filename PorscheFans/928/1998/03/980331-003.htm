Hello,

I just purchased a 93 928GTS, 5 speed, with 24K on the clock.  The car is
absolutely immaculate inside and out.  Just had a pre-inspection done by my
local Porsche Dealer (in Atlanta) and they said it was one of the cleanest
928s they've seen recently - gave it a clean bill of health.  Now my
question.  I asked them if I could purchase a warranty for the car and they
said I can get one that covers practically everything except for regular
wear items (brake pads, clutch, etc) for $2,500 which covers the car for 3
years/36,000 miles.  I checked it out and it does seem to be extremely
comprehensive.  I've checked out the warranty company (Warrantech
Automotive) and they've been in business a long time - seem to be solid.

Is it worth spending the money on this warranty?  Like to hear what you guys
think.

Thanks,

Eric
