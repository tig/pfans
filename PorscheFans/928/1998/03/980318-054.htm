Not personally (see above :-), but yes.

Fah! Don't succumb to this bigotry. It takes relatively few dollars
to coax some serious straight-line performance out of Hondas, Camaros,
Mustangs and the like and that's all you get to use at the stoplight.
A friend's ``lowly Camaro'' with 10 or so psi of Vortech boost can
click off high 11s at more than 120 mph. That's well beyond factory GTS
territory. I'd rather have a nice '78 928 in the curves, but you see
my point.

Flame away, for I am wearing my Nomex underwear today!
