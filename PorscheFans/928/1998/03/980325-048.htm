Tom,

The 518 should prevent the bolts from backing out, but the problem with
the shrinking cork won't change.  Leaks are still a very real
possibility, even with 518 on the gasket and bolts.  

The 518 worked on my TB tensioner.  I was fighting a sudden oil leak
from Oct at Lime Rock.  Turned out to be bolt 14b (per manuals), it
needs 518 (574) to prevent the oil from the return gally from oozing all
over the tensioner and the timing belt.  I thought it was the front main
seal.  After using the 518 on the old gasket and all the bolts, it seems
to have controlled the oil.  I was at Lime Rock last week and had no oil
leaks to speak of.
