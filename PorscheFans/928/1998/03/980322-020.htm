Gene,
>I seem to have hit a tender spot.  Do you own a $4600.00 Porsche Bicycle?
NOPE, but have a few friends that do and they feel just as strongly that
these are the best overall engineered bicycles as you feel a Ferrari is one
of the best engineered cars.

>You dodged my comparison between Porsche designed watches and Casios. Also,
>between Porsche Bicycles and Ferrari F50s. If I offended you, I apologize.
I didn't dodge it, it made no sense to me, my point was and is what makes
someone an idiot for paying $4600 for a well engineered bicycle versus Mega
six figures for a well engineered Ferrari , it's just a car and is not to be
worshipped, just driven or ridden in both cases.

>We all use words from time to time that may offend without meaning to.  I
>drove and raced 356s and 911s and still think they're great cars; just not
>my idea of great GT cars.  I never considered anyone who bought 911s as
>being idiots.
I seem to have hit a sore spot also. Do you own a $80,000 Volkswagen,  I
mean Porsche?

> I happen to be 6'2" and 200 pounds and even in my later

Agree whole heartedly, I never did.

>Further, I did not trash any companies or "worshipers",  I merely said that

As I said before you are a lucky man.

This only proves my point, maybe had you used quality parts installed
correctly to original standards you would not have spent so much.

For example:

79 928 owned 7 months 12,000 miles - No repairs
84 928S owned 3 years - 71,000 miles - Water pump, Timing belt $200
86 928S owned 2 years - 39,000 miles - No repairs
89 928S4 owned 2 years - 5,000 miles (Garage Queen and has it's own set of
Porsche Toothbrushes)
89 928GT owned 1 month - 3,300 miles. - Motor Mounts $490
87 944 Turbo 9 months - 12,000 miles - Turbo coolant pump $72

Plus normal tune-ups, etc. at recommend intervals:

No, I don't drive them, I just look at them.

Since you started driving Porsches 6 or 7 years before I was born, give me
20 years and I might catch your mileage record in 928s ;-)
