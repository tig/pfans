This is totally reversible - I'm talking about the 'slim
jim' console between the seats.  I used to mount my
extinguisher there, got the idea from Marc's car.  Although
after reading the rules you posted, using nuts and bolts vs.
screws makes it a little more difficult.  Yikes!

And a good quote too!

Halon is big bucks for a DE kinda' car/event ie. 2.5 dry
chem $29.99 vs. $120 for same in halon.  Little extinguisher
material to clean up if that's a big concern *after* a
fire...  (caveat here, if you 'show' your car don't leave it
alone, I had someone swipe my extinguisher for their dead
one, thanks alot, and no this wasn't 928-related)

Ok, let's cut to the chase - have a look at the Brey-Kraus
seat bracket 
http://209.19.107.64/ogshell/loadpage.pl?477+catfire.html

A little pricey but it's already made, should fit the bill
and you can order it online.  Hmm, I may have just sold
myself too.  Wow, look at that chrome halon extinguisher!

Oh boy!
