 True. Perhaps the best reference that is widely available is that 1 hr. 
special hosted by Jay Leno. I have forgotten the name of the special, but 
it had a Porsche 911, a Ferrari F50, and a Callaway Corvette as the 
focus.  During the interview with the Porsche factory rep., I notice how 
he pronounced it; it was "Pah she," with a very abrupt drop-off of sound 
after the 'h' - almost non-existent 'uh' on the end.
