Yikes, how things get taken out of context!!!

This whole thread started when somebody in the 924-944 group was
questioning whether a 924 was a true Porsche, to which someone
else responded that the 944 was in effect the first water-cooled
product accepted as a true Porsche, at which point I questioned
whether they had forgotten the 928 - which in fact they had, and
were.  I don't remember anyone seriously questioning whether the
928 was a true Porsche.

>ever heard of that

As for the 928 being "detuned" to keep it's performance beneath
the 911 - I do remember some such rumors back in the late 70s and
early 80s, but if the 928 was supposed to be the successor to the
911, how does this make any sense?  I tend to agree with Phil that
it was other factors that probably influenced the power output,
and fuel economy may well have been one of them.  I still remember
seeing ads on television for the 924 that stressed the mileage
over the performance - and before you laugh, the 924 was a pretty
decent car for it's time.

As for why the 928 didn't succeed in dethroning the 911... how
many of you know someone who thinks "Porsche" is a one-syllable
word?  In fact, how many of you know anyone who doesn't?  I've
known more than a few people who have bought a "Porsche" (one-
syllable) as a status symbol or because of a mid-life crisis,
and they all bought a 911.  Many of them didn't even know that
Porsche made any other cars!  For a long time "Porsche" and "911"
were synonymous - and even though the car has changed radically
from it's early days, it's still called a 911.

Amen, brother!
