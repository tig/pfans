	   My 83S 5 speed was sitting for about 2 weeks.   I
	was unable to drive because of shoulder surgery.

	   Last night when I went to start it....DEAD.  The
	battery was new in November; the alternator is also
	new (not rebuilt) at the same time.
	   Something was mentioned about a "trickle"
	something or other which makes this problem
	avoidable.
	   Also, someone mentioned a 'low-resistance' cable
	from the battery to the front of the car.

	   Now that it is 'my turn in the barrel'..... HELP!!!

	Thanks,

You have a drain somewhere.  A new battery should not be dead in two week.  Both my 928s
sits for three weeks with no problem starting.  Put a test lamp in series between the
positive cable and battery post.  If there is a drain, the lamp will glow.  Start pulling
fuses one at a time.  When the lamp is not lit, that is the circuit where the drain is at.
If all fuses are out and the lamp is still on, start checking the non-fused item, like the
alternator, starter etc.
