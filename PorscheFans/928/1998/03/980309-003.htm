The TERRIBLE story of a 928 smashed by hail was a terrible way to start the
morning!

BUT, here are some comments about the insurance aspect.

First of all, it is likely that the car will be totalled, and there likely
will be an attempt on the part of the adjuster to really screw you, Dave.
He will try to take the car's Blue Book value, and discount that for mileage
and all sorts of other things.  My guess is that the initial offer from the
insurance company would probably be in the sub-$9,000 range.

What you should do from the very first, is take the car to a body shop that
can work on the 928.  If you don't know of one where you are, FIND ONE, and
take the car there to have an estimate for repair/restoration.  Otherwise,
the insurance company will probably assign an adjuster to complete a full
appraisal, which will mean that the insurance company will want to use the
adjuster's figures for the basis of everything, which will put you on the
defensive from the git go.

VERY IMPORTANT is to ascertain the Actual Cash Value of YOUR car prior to
the loss.  This is NOT the "book value" or any value other than the value of
your car.  The way to get this done, is to get letters of valuation from as
many knowledgable 928 people as possible.  If you have recent photographs of
the car, they can be used by people (perhaps Brian Buxton would give you a
range on letterhead).  This information will give you the ACV of your car,
and that is the figure that you want to use, IF it is higher than the
so-called "blue book" value.

Make no mistake about this:  the insurance company and the adjuster are NOT
your friends at this point.  Get as much information about valuations of
these cars before the insurance company sees the car, and then go carefully
from there.

AFTER the valuation is met, and the insuance company is going to cut you a
check, THEN and only then, discuss buying the car back.  I really think that
putting the buy back idea on the table will make it more difficult to
negotiate the financial part of the settlement.

Now, it is VERY possible that the insurance company might just replace your
car with another of similar mileage and condition, with minimal cash
changing hands.  You might not want to buy the old car back at all, in that
case.

But first, first and most important of all, is to begin to gather data about
the real value of your car prior to the loss.  The 928 is old enough and
unusual enough to provide a real problem for an insurance company to
appriase and value at time of total loss.  You should work VERY hard to have
good figures ready to aid in the adjustment process.

Quite some time ago, when I was an insurance agent, a client had a '66
Mustang GT that he had done a complete restoration on, except for the paint.
ON one of the first nice early spring nights, he couldn't resist, and he and
his wife went bowling in the Mustang.  When they came out of the alley, the
Mustang was GONE, and probably, was pieces on a chop shop floor by the end
of the second string.

The insurance company offered him 100% of the current NADA book value for
the car.  The problem was that his Actual Cash Value in parts alone was lots
more than that and as I recall, there was no valuation for a high power
Mustang.  In his case, he had pictures of the restoration process and the
car in primer, registered for the road.  He got the local Ford dealer as
well as three other places to give him a value.  

The insured ended up getting the value of the car, PLUS all the parts that
he had put into it, which included the 289 hipower V8.  The insured was
basically happy, although he did not get anywhere near what the real value
of the car was.

To be fair, I think that basically insurors try to make fair and equitable
settlements with their policeholders.  A lot of times, the adjusters are
either young and trying to make a name for themselves, or are independent
adjusters who will get more business from the insurance company if they
return low value settlements to the claims managers. The basic problem is
always one of valuation, and in the face of no other information, the
insurance company through the adjuster, will try to use the lowest value in
whichever valuation guide that they want to use.

Good luck! and be sure to post your story as it goes along.  Also, let us
all know the name of your insurance company, whether the settlement
experience is good OR bad.
