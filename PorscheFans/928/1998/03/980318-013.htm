Stephane.
Bet big money it is the motor mounts.

I had that same vibration in my 89 GT.  I happened to have some new motor
mounts that had been lying around for a few years and last weekend decided
to toss them in the GT (was a major pain but well worth it).

I was AMAZED at the difference, totally silky smooth with no chassis
vibrations at all ;-)
For the first time ever I have driven a 928 that didn't have even the
slightest vibrations at all.

I have  been working on a measurement procedure to check this but need a
little more data.
 I could show you easily in person or with pictures, but it is very hard to
explain. There is actually what looks to be a factory measuring gauge built
in to the front of the left mount and the rear of the right mount.
Ironically the farther the distance on this gauge the more it is worn.  When
the mounts are new the upper and lower part of this "gauge" will actually be
touching each other until the engine weight is applied and then separate
about a 1/4", when there is more than 3/4" separation at this area is when
the upper bracket starts to touch the mount and begins wearing though the
rubber to the metal inner structure of the motor mount.

When I removed the old mounts from the 89 GT (84k miles, very well
maintained) the mount had compressed so much that there were a few places
that the upper engine mount bracket had worn through the rubber of the mount
into the metal inner structure of the motor mount, hence the chassis
vibrations.
I have seen this on every 928 that I have disassembled, except the low
mileage 91. It seems to vary more with age than mileage. The recent 86 that
I parted only had 63K on it and the mounts were also worn through to the
metal inner structure.

Hope that helps,
