Error in logic there.  No improvement in lap times therefore why 
use SS lines.

Furthermore, Kevin states SS lines are failure prone and I'd have
to agree from what I've heard.  I've received many replies from those
with failed SS lines, but only one from failed rubber hose.  IMO the SS
lines DOT or not seem
to be a bit of a liability simply from the fact that you cannot
inspect the line.  

Bruce Anderson put it nicely too, saying that if you looked over
time you would find many more instances of failed SS lines than
OEM.  That's enough for me to hear to stick to OEM, though I am running
SS lines
on the toy car.  Will take 'em off later for sure.

Everything is a trade off though.  Harder pedal vs. possible
catastrophe?
Accelerated replacement interval vs. cost?
etc.

Choose wisely shark fans...
