Yeah, he said I'd have to stick something in the joint and gently pry it 
apart and maybe tap the pan with a rubber or plastic mallet.  I think 
it's worth the trade-off, IF it doesn't leak. =:-o

I did it with the engine in the car.  I tried just jacking the engine 
up, but there was no way in hell I could get the pan off that way.  The 
oil pick-up is in the way.  Someone said they were able to reach in 
there and undo the three small bolts that hold it on, and let it drop 
into the pan, and then were able to remove it, but I couldn't/didn't 
want to do that.

I unbolted the steering rack from the crossmember, pulled it down as far 
as I could (didn't disconnect any of the lines), then undid the 
crossmember and pulled it down (support the engine with jack stands, and 
you also have to undo the bottom suspension arms to get the crossmember 
down).  Once you get all that stuff loose and pulled down (you don't 
have to actually remove the stuff completely) THEN you can get the pan 
off.

I put the GTS baffle in there too - $10 from DEVEK.  Bolts right in.
