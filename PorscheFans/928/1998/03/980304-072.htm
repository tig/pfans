I'm new here so Id though id share my story about my 1979 928.

Me and my dad aquired our 928 in 1986. One year later we had the catalytic
conveters removed and the heads heavily ported and polished. Since then its
been in storage. We recently took it out of storage. It has only 75,000
miles and runs better than ever. Just recently we have added a performance
exhaust by borla and a K&N Filtercharger. I have no idea what my horsepower
rating is but i am guessing around 385. One time i had my 928 at 110mph in
3rd gear with two to go. The fastest weve ever had it was 160mph but my dad
got scared (chickened out) and laid off the gas so we don't exactly know
what its top speed is.  

Anyway This bas-ass pulled up to me in a 1998 Camaro SS at a red light and
wanted to race. He called my porsche a peice of crap phrased around in
different words. I asked him how many horses he had and he said 320. He
asked me the same and i told him 215 which is stock on a 1979 and I lied.
Anyway i embarresed the hell-out-of-him. He got a better start with his
limited slip differential. I in that area was unlucky, i reved it at 3,500
rpm and dumped the clutch and got rubber. but i eased off the gas and
regained traction. By this time my front end was about two seconds behind
his tailend. but after i recovered i slung shot by him and even with a bad
start humilitated him and his panzy camaro. Imagine, a puny 19-year-old 4.5
liter smashing a brand new 5.7 liter chevy LT1 350.
I will send later send pictures of the car and the heads being ported.
