	Some have said you should replace the shift handle lever with the one 
from the GT, rather than cut the original.  Well I removed mine to cut it 
and getting it out and back in is not easy, I would recomend cutting in 
place.  Sombody gave the idea of cutting it in a plastic bag to limit the 
mess, good idea!

	I then adjusted the ball cup until the shift knob is close to the radio, 
not easy, nearlly inpossible without having the car on a lift!  Maybe 
it's just me but did they put the center console to far back, those 
window switches are just silly!

	The rear coupling new has some play, it has to!  I have a 914 early, 
very bad gear linkage.  So I figure, hey I am pretty smart, added some 
braze rod material to the shifter to get rid of the play.  Had it fit up 
with no play at all, then you couldn't shift at all!  Spent some time 
with a file and now it works pretty good!  I don't really understand why 
but you need some play in the linkage, but not alot!  Any extra play 
makes it very sloppy, seems the best set up is to have no play at all but 
one connection.

	Well thats my 2 cents worth anyhow.
