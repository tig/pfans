I think I'm the youngest guy on the list. He isn't even close to leading me astray, it's too
late.

Sounds like fun.

Forget steering, I think doughnuts would be interesting.

I'd do it. Even with my limited flight training, I think I could pull it off.

Yup that's it. If you talk to an owner be sure to note whether his/hers is an R/T 10 or GTS.

They aren't that bad for an American muscle car.

By any chance, is he also flaming?

Hell yeah! Zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds for an old R/T 10. I think the new R/T 10 and GTS can do
it in 4.3. With 335 rear tires you can put a lot of torque on the pavement. You have to have
one hell of a fast shark to keep up with one. The only U.S. legal car that can keep up is a
993 Turbo (0-60 in 3.9) or TurboS (0-60 in 3.6)
