Michael:

Potential Victim Alert!

Radar works just fine from the rear.  Doppler shift occurs in any direction,
it just happens to be most accurate from straight on, going or coming.  CHP
has started using a front-mounted horn for their radar in some places like
the Tejon/Grapevine area and the I-5 area at Camp Pendleton.  This is to
help defeat the detector owners.  Watching some in-car camera stuff on the
tube the other night,  the marked cars sit in plain sight on the center
shoulder, and shoot at the rear of passing cars.  The front-facing
detector's range is limited because the only signal you get is the one
reflected off the rear of the target car ahead of you.  Officer had
thoughtfully placed his car just past an overpass too, which might also
block some of the reflected energy.

Arguing "cosine error" may be futile in front of a Judge or DA who has
passed basic trig.  Cosine error actually favors the speeder, since the
apparent (radar) speed is less than actual.  Your argument needs to include
some innacuracy due to the officer's technique in panning the search head
trying to track you.  If he gets a good reading within the 15 degree capture
window without panning,  you may be guilty.

Best defense I've found beyond being awake/aware of your driving, is to
maintain your first class radiotelephone/telegraph operators license with a
radar endorsement.  "Only one of us was qualified to push the calibration
button, your honor"  Worked OK so far...  I keep a copy of my license on the
detector, along with a copy of my ham license on the detector and the
scanner.  I can arrest an officer who tries to confiscate the equipment in
any state, including Virginia.  Precedent cases are on file.  Haven't tried
the arrest thing yet.  =8-)  Bigger threat here in California is a thief
who'll break a $400 window to get a $50 radra detector.  Next biggest is
getting rear-ended by the guy without a radar detector...


So, C&D readers, How did the current V-1 fare in the "radar detector
detector" department?  I'm ready to cut the check for one anyway,  but look
for a little info on this.  The remote display with the search head mounted
between the rear visors sounds like a real winner to me.  The cyclops light
is in the way, so the box it sits in may get a bit bigger to give the
antenna a clear view back.  Do I need to upholster the unit in leather to
remain authentic?
