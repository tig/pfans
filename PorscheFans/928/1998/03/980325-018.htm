Gary,

I'll tell you what NOT to do.  If you decide to paint it, DON'T apply a 
sealer first!  I used Thompson's water-seal on 1/2 of mine (2 car 
garage), then painted it with concrete floor enamel.  I think what 
happens is, the paint is porous, and will let water through eventually, 
but the sealer will not.  Moisture gets trapped in between, and "lifts" 
the paint.  It's all peeling now, and looks like sh*t!  The paint on the 
other side, that I didn't seal, still looks great.  Now I have to figure 
out if there's any way to get that damn sealer off!  Anyone have any 
suggestions?  (respond privately I guess)

Just my .02, for what it's worth.
