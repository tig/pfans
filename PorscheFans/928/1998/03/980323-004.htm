After hearing about the air pump and air pump filter in several posts, I
decided to try and find the filter on my 86. Located it pretty quick,
but due to some metal hoses, it took a while to remove. Apparently, the
hoses have kept a lot of people from removing it, it was GROSS!
Suggestion: if you are not 100% sure your air pump filter has been
replaced, check it yourself!

Question 1: The canister that holds the filter has one spout that a hose
is conected to that runs to the air pump, then there is another spout
that just hangs there - is there suppose to be another hose attached? If
so, where would/does it go to?

Question 2: From the air pump, another hose runs to a switch/regulator
of some sort that has two additional hoses attached, one to the air
filter housing and one (I'm assuming) to the exhaust. What does the
switch/regulator do? Draw more air from the air filter housing if it
isn't getting enough from the air pump or push air into the housing to
assist with forcing more air into the engine?

Any enlightenment would be appreciated.
