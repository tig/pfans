Thursday March 5, 1998 my 928S was destroyed by a Hail storm in Monroe,
La.
The head lights were broken, windshield broken, rear window completely
destroyed and scattered inside the black leather interior. The hood,
roof, and sides are all dented from marble to baseball sided dents. All
of the interior lights are dangling over a wet interior.
I would assume that the insurance will total this car. Blue Book SR is
$12,410.
Can anyone suggest how to deal with the insurance to keep the value and
buy the car for salvage value.
Any suggestions will be appreciated.
Thanks,
dp
928 (85) & (79)
Pathfinder (95)
