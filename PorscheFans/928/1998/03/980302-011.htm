<<Can anyone recommend good speakers for the doors of my 83, what size are
they anyway?  Does my car have an amp or does all the power come from the
stereo? I have a monterey deck. It works great but doesn't fully light up
at night,, (can't read the station).>>

Rob,

I assume that your '83 currently has speakers behind the door panels with
the little holes in it.  Unfortunately, if you want to maintain the stock
look of having bottom-mounted (behind the panel) speakers, your choices
aren't too great.  I recently replaced my stock speakers and didn't want to
cut the panels.  The only thing that will fit behind the panels without
having to cut any metal out of the door panels, are 3 1/2" speakers with no
tweeter protrusion and only 1 5/8" mounting depth.  I installed a pair of 3
1/2" Blaupunkts from Crutchfield which were a tight fit, but I got 'em in
there.  They sound pretty good and are rated pretty high for 3 1/2" but
they can't pump out much bass.  Your car probably has the stock amp as well
which is located under the compartment between the passenger seat and the
passenger door (where the hatch release knob is).  The amp may have been
useful with the stock equipment, but with the more powerful decks available
these days, it may not provide much benefit.  I installed a new deck and
just by-passed the amp.  I left the amp in place, however, in case I decide
to use it with a subwoofer.

P.S. If you want to pull the door panels off, see Ed Ruiz's 3/1/98 post #44
or I can send you directions I received from Tom Green.
