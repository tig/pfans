Kevin,
Send me your address and I will send you that plastic piece.

Concerning the wiring, it sounds like it is correct. The switching circuit
is on the same fuse as your interior lights, just the switching circuit, the
main power feed to the actual motor is on another circuit.

I would suspect your short is underneath the panels where your switches are.
Remove the panels and check that the 3 spade connectors are not shorting
against each other or something else.
