<<Can anyone share experiences on Escort (Passport and Solo) and the
Valentine radar detectors. If there are other products which you think
are worthwhile, please share your thoughts. >>

Steve,
I own a new Solo cordless radar detector and have been very happy with
it.  The range decreases as battery life weakens, but other than that it
is a very good detector with good battery life.  Very few false alarms
in town too.  The Valentine is probably the best "regualr" detector out
there, but the biggest, naddest available is the K40.  They are custom
installed in teh front and rear bumper of your car and have a remote
readout somewhere in your dash.  Looks factory and is an excellent
system.  Expensive though.  Upwards of $800 for the best they offer. 
However, they guarantee to pay all speeding tickets you get within 1 yr
of your purchase - no matter how fast you were going.  I have this
system in both my 928S4 and my 348 and highly recommend it.  If you're
already spending $400+ for the Valentine why not get the best?
