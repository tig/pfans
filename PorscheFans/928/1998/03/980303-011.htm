There were a couple of comments and a question about what happens to
hydraulic valve lifters when you have no oil pressure (or no oil).

Hydraulic lifters are used to continuously adjust the valve lash
(clearance) and keep it at essentially zero clearance. There is a
limited amount of travel in the lifter, and this travel is less than the
valve lift. If you have no oil pressure, the oil that is trapped in the
lifter will soon leak out, and the lifter  will be "collapsed". The
valves will still open, they just won't open as far, and the noise
(valve clatter) will be very noticeable. This is sometimes the first
indication of trouble for people who don't look at gages and don't have
idiot lights.

So, the short answer is yes, an engine will run without oil pressure,
even if it has hydraulic lifters.
