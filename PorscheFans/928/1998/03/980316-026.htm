Phil,

I had this reply from:
David Roberts mm_innov@earthlink.net

"On US spec cars (have heard this will also work on some ROW cars) this =
can be changed by pulling the computer lever towards you 2 times in 1 =
second, pull again for 3 seconds and it will revert back as before."

I'll give his simple method a try and then investigate the 'contact =
bridge 9293' method.

Thanks for tying up the loose ends on my last few queries, I don't think =
the cat on the 928 I'm getting has an air pump. The cat looked to me to =
be passive, I didn't see any sensors, pumps or anything attached to it.

Regards

Nigel,

We call 'em test pipes since they're only to be used at the track...

already filled?

no - means the straight-through test pipe should have a bung welded on =
it so you can reinstall the stock O2 sensor - must have!

Bursch is an aftermarketer.  The airpump might be specific to U.S. cars =
only?  Basically it is a belt driven pump (like the a/c compressor or =
such) and it pumps air into the catalyst to promote further burning of =
the exhaust gas to lower emissions.  Maybe your car doesn't even have =
one.  But if you do and replace the cat with the straight pipes, then =
the air pump fitting isn't needed and there's no harm to just pumping to =
atmosphere. =20
For laughs, others have rerouted the air outlet into the intake air =
snorkel.  Obviously no performance benefit there.  The real benefit is =
this the owner keeps the airpump on the drive belt and running.  =
Airpumps which haven't been used tend to seize up in just a few months =
from non-use.  And we need to smog certify our cars every two years. At =
least $150 replacement costs for the pump alone...
