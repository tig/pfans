Generally, Konis are expected to give a harsher ride than Bilsteins for the
same level of control. More controversially, Bilsteins have a better
reputation for reliability.

You don't have to be as old as you are (let alone as old as I am) to want
this. It's part of having one vehicle be an enjoyable cruising car as well
as hot rod. My (very happy) experience with Bilsteins on other cars lead me
to expect a bit more adaptation by the shocks to varying situations, versus
the "you set me this way, so what did you expect" behavior some find
characteristic of Konis (fine for the track, where everything can be
tweaked to a fare-thee-well, but not for all the conditions experienced in
the real world).

>Any info?

Some. Bilstein's Web site (http://www.bilstein.com) leads you to a
still-under-construction product locator which lists front and rear shocks
for cars up to '86 and rears only for some later cars. I'm also curious
about the possibility of Bilsteins on the 928 (saw them as OEM on a Ferrari
F50 the other day, in case someone wants to dismiss Bilsteins as wimp
shocks), so I'll make more inquiries and post anything interesting.
