> Hi Ed,
> The noise does become audible when I'm am going slowly or giving light
> throttle in any gear.  People that have ridden with me have also tracked
> the noise to under the passenger side near to where the back of the door
> is.  I had planned to check it out monday, but I am now under about a
foot
> of snow here in South Bend, IN and there is still a winter storm warning
> out.  I'm beginning to think that it is definately the filter.  Hopefully
> this is where the filter is because I have yet to ask where exactly the
> filter is on my 83 automatic.  It sounds like the car is trying to suck
the
> fuel through a squeezed straw.  This puts extra strain on the fuel pump
I'm
> sure so I haven't been driving it at all,,, not that I could drive it
> anywhere right now except straight into a ditch.  Hopefully I will be
able
> to help more people in the near future since one of my best buddies is
now
> working under a great porsche mechanic.  He just doesn't see 928's quite
as
> often as the other 928's.  Also to answer a question about the "whoosh" ,
> the tank doesn't "whoosh" when opening the cap after a long drive, but
> opening the cap while on a long drive seems to stop the noise for awhile.
 
> Oh yeah I almost forgot, do you by anychance know what goes next to the
> light on the driver's door (coin holder?) I have a hole there where
> something was taken out.
> Thanks, at least it isn't the synchros even though yours don't seem to be
> hurting anything.  I've only had the car for a couple weeks and am still
> surprised by the powerful acceleration of only 234hp.
