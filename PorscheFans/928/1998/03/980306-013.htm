Mike Somerville is wrong and right with his comment about radar not
working from behind.  If the radar unit is stationary, it can accurately
clock the speed of a vehicle (or boat) coming towards AND moving away
from it.  That's why you see police cruisers with radar sitting on
entrance ramps painting vehicles after they go by.  This works!

However, if the cruiser is ROLLING, the radar unit can only clock
oncoming vehicles, not the ones going in the same direction.

Mike is correct with his statement about radar not working from the side
of the vehicle.

As to why rear detection, with the V-1 it's simple.  If the radar signal
is getting stronger and the V-1 tells you the signal is coming from
behind, the radar unit is approaching from the rear.  If the V-1 picks
up a weak signal from the front, and then as you pass an interchange the
signal switches to side and then rear quickly and the signal becomes
strong, you can be sure that you just passed a radar unit pointed at the
rear of traffic from the interchange.

There are many scenarios that would make this information valuable to an
alert driver!

BTW, cosine error doesn't enter into it unless the direction of travel
gets beyond a certain angle to the direction the radar unit is pointed,
coming or going.
