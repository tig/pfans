I have scrutinized many of the car detailing web pages and have read
many pages of Larry's recommendations.  However, what I can't find is
any information on just how you supposed to remove tar - other than
don't use petroleum-based products.

I've seen references that indicate that citrus-based products should
be used but no recommendations for specific products.  I assume that
somebody out there other than me has some road tar on lower body in
the vicinity of the trailing side of the wheels. 

How do you remove the tar?

Goo-Gone?  It IS citrus-based.
