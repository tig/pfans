> Brian, I think I'm indirectly responsible for giving you free
> advertising on this list, by asking about current car prices and your
> markup ! I'll just take 5.00 % right off the top, thank you. It makes
> me crazy when people have something to sell but they don't include the
> price. I imagine everyone feels the same way. I like the fact that
> BMW, Porsche have a program to allow buyers to fly over to Germany,
> stay in first class accommodations, drive the car around Europe for a
> week or two, and then ship it home for the cost of buying one from a
> showroom floor here in the states, thus eliminating the expensive
> markup the dealers impose on us because of inventory, advertising etc.
> costs. I think the ultimate purchase is from a PO that has taken the
> depreciation hit, cared for the car with love and money and his
> wife/husband (I live in SF) is divorcing him. Obviously he loved the
> car more than her/him (she/he also wants the money).

> My tube has been making noise for well over a year now, since I've
> owned it and the period Phil had it. It's the standard rattling
> exhaust sound that's most prominent at idle and slower speeds. I drive
> it every day, and I'm slightly concerned, only because  one person on
> the list said they ruined their tranny when it gave out. I plan on
> buying a rebuilt tube and installing it myself. A good stereo sure
> makes a difference. Can't hear it, so why worry !
