Pardon me for taking what might amount to a
poll that has been covered before I joined, but I
am curious about the relative fuel efficiencies of
years and models of 928, and the variance among
vehicles (other than due to conditions).  I can't
find much good data.  This comes up because
yesterday I had a 500-mile trip, and took the
opportunity to check the mileage.  I averaged
18.7 and 17.7 mpg (US) in the two legs of the
trip (95% highway miles @ ca. 70-80 mph. (I
converted all the metric since most of the list
members appear to be Yanks, and I know the
Canucks, Kiwis, etc. can do it both ways.) 

I checked two 1981 car mag articles on the 928
(mine is 1981 auto, loaded) and their estimates
were 16 to 19 mpg, so it is still right on.  Q: If I
were to forsake this Plain Jane (I'm glad it
doesn't have internet access) for a later S or an
S4, would I lose anything like this fairly decent
(for a V8) gas mileage? 

vielen dank,
Dan
