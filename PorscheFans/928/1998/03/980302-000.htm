I'm about to move into the market for a 928 and I'd appreciate any
recommendations of competent mechanics located in the Los Angeles, or
San Gabriel Valley, CA areas. How is the inspection of a prospective
purchase accomplished? Can said mechanic be coerced (for the appropriate
fee, of course) to take some of his precious time to go out and inspect
cars, or must the seller agree to let the car be put into the mechanic's
shop for some length of time? And how much does such an inspection fee
usually run?

A side question - As a 928 fanatic of questionable mental stability, I
am totally fascinated by the checkered op-art cloth interiors on some of
the early cars. How rare is it? On what models (5-sp. only?), model
years ('78 & '79?) and continents (Euro only?) was that interior
available? Is there any chance those bits can be had via parts houses or
salvage?

---
One last thing...it was recently suggested that we include job
descriptions at the bottom of our posts to the list in order to foster
more of a "networking" atmosphere among the list members. Before that
happens, I'd be even more eager to see posters mention their City,
State/Region, and Country. It'd be nice to know from whence we all hail.
Any seconds?
