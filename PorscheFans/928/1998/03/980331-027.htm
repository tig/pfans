Subject: Microsoft / GM (fwd)
Bill Gates wanted to look good and impress everyone with his
success. He decided to measure Microsoft accomplishments against General
Motors.
His comparison went like this:
 If automotive technology had kept pace with computer technology over
the past few decades, you would now be driving a V-32 instead of a V8,
and it would have a top speed of 10,000 miles/hour (160,000km/hr). Or you
have an economy car that weighs 30 pounds (14 kilos) and gets a
 thousand miles to the gallon of gas.
In either case, the sticker of the new car would be less than $50.00.
In response to all this goading, GM responded: "Yes, but would you
really want to drive a car that crashes 4 times a day?"
GM also responded:  If Microsoft built cars:
1. Every time they re-painted the lines on the road, you'd have to buy a
new car.
2. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you'd
have to restart it.  For some strange reason, you'd just accept this and
drive on.
 3. Occasionally, your car would stop and fail to restart, and you'd have
to reinstall the engine.  For some strange reason, you'd just accept this
too.
 4. You could only have one person in the car at a time, unless you
 bought a Car95 or a CarNT.  But then you'd have to buy more seats.
 5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was twice
as fast, twice as easy to drive-but would only run on 5 percent of the
 roads.
 6. The Macintosh car owners would get expensive Microsoft upgrades to
their cars, which would make their cars run much slower.
7. The oil, engine, gas and alternator warning lights would be
replaced by a single "General Car Default" warning light.
8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt.
9. The airbag system would say, "Are you sure?" before going off.
10. If you were involved in a crash, you would have no idea what   
happened.
