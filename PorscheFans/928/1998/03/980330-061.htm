Just wanted to say thanks to a few list members and let
everyone else know I'm a proud owner of a 1994 928 GTS.  To
jog everyone's memory - this was the beautiful dark blue
metallic GTS with 9000 miles at a dealer near Chicago.  The
ad for it was originally posted to the list by John Kiser
about two weeks ago with further info provided by John Tow.
Thanks especially to these two for pointing out the vehicle.
Thanks also to Brian Buxton and Robert Jecmen for helpful
comments.

I haven't had much opportunity to drive it - apart from the
two hour drive home from Chicago.  But, it is a blast!  It's
a good deal quicker than my 88 S4 and stops better too.
Looking forward to better weather and some free time to
enjoy it more.

Thanks again

Mike McQuaid
