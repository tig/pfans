The vinyl doesn't tuck in, it is glued to the top of the door
panel.  At least it was on the '85 S. 

Get to Stephane Chabot's site (the FAQ) for door panel removal
procedures.  These are MUST HAVE!  I used the instructions Phil T 
wrote.

You will also need some auto upolstery adhesive, I used some
3M spray stuff with great results.  Follow directions on can.

I had some of the little fasteners that were brittle, and they
broke, or didn't work effectively.  The fasteners 'twist' into 
the wood particle panel and then 'snap' into the door frame.
I would recommend going to a Porsche dealer and picking
up some, they are inexpensive.

Clean up the elec. contacts while you're in there.

It's real easy Warren, and well worth doing yourself!
