    As so many owners of late have reported the subject problem perhaps
it would be good idea if someone with a webpage were willing to include
the following inf. in their Tech Tips section.  Any volunteers?

    Problem/Concern:  

    as stated by factory bulletin # 9401 is "clutch chatter due to
unfavorable     tolerances.

    Symptoms:  

   although the bulletin calls it "chatter", in my particular case it
was a varying    combination of a squeak and a click.  It could only be
heard when the clutch           was out.  The noise would disappear as
soon as the slightest bit of clutch            pedal pressure was
applied.  To be certain get underneath your car and          listen to
your clutch housing  while the car is running.  It should be obvious if
this is the problem.

    Models Affected: 

    928 S4, 928 GT and 928 GTS, 1987- on
    Upgraded parts were used as of October 1993 from VIN:
    92 5RS 8201 11

     Solution:  

      upgrading to the following factory pieces,
                    
                    928 116 085 08   Release bearing
                    928 116 832 09   Release bearing arm
                    928 116 087 16   Guide sleeve

      These parts must be installed as a set and MUST NOT be mixed with
previous versions.

  IMPORTANT Installation notes:  
    
     DO NOT USE LUBRICATION on the sliding surfaces.  New bearing and
guide sleeve have a sliding fit interface which no longer requires
lubrication.

     Previously,  there were two shims installed between the release
bearing      and the clutch pressure plate spring.  The upgraded
release bearing                requires ONLY ONE SHIM.
