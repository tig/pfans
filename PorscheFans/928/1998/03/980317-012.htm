  Assuming that all the parts you've replaced are still good (clutch,
  slave, master, synchros in the rebuilt trans), I would be tempted
  to follow the workshop manuals and bleed the clutch system yet again.
  You should also check the condition of the ball cup on the front
  shifter guide rod and the bushings in the rear shifter coupler.  Based
  on your description, I think you're putting a lot of stress on the
  ball cup and I would bet it is getting ready to ruin your day very
  soon.
  
  FWIW, I have to press the clutch pedal almost all the way to the floor
  before changing gears and I'm confident that my system is well bled.
  Also, I was pleasantly surprised at the improvement made by switching
  to a synthetic in the transaxle.  The clutch pedal still has to go to
  the floor, but the shifts are much smoother.
