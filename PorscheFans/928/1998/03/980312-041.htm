Hi Bob,

Thanks for the info,
 I gather from what you've said that I need to obtain from somewhere the
trim pieces that would go on an older 928 that did not have the s spoiler. 
Then  thes trim pieces would pretty much conceal all but two holes that are
not even visible when hatch is closed.  Hey this doesn't sound so bad at
all.   I now need to decide on either a composite or the black rubber type
s4 repo wings that are even more expensive than the composites which would
require painting.  So i suppose it would just about even out.  The only
thing left to do is find out from someone if the s4 wing just needs holes
drilled.   Thanks again for the very descriptive answer!
