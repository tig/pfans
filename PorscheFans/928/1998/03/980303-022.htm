My computer crashed three weeks ago in disastrous fashion and I've just now
gotten it up and breathing, so haven't received any Email till now, and see
that there is an ongoing discussion as to what constitutes a "pure
Porsche".  My 87 S4 5sp is one of the 2% mentioned by Ron Brown,  However,
I think that I've found the answer to the ideal, blindingly fast, all
German 928. 

Looking for parts now.  An S4  or later will do.  Remove engine and back
seats.  Move center section of firewall back about 15".  Install Mercedes
Benz DB 605 DCM inverted-vee  12 cylinder engine from Messerschmidt Bf
109K-4.  Standard equipment includes supercharger and nitrous oxide
boosting. Rated stock at 1491 KW (2000 hp) for takeoff.
  
Connect directly to Mercedes 5 speed auto semi-truck transmission. This
should add just about enough weight in the rear to maintain the original
50-50 weight distribution.  This will absolutely blow off anything on the
road and look good while doing it.  Needs 110 octane avgas, but what the
hell, you've got to make a few small sacrifices for such an incredible
perfomance gain, and its' pure Deutsche. Optional equipment includes Mk 103
30-mm cannon & 60 rounds of armor piercing ammo,  perfect for clearing the
left lane of I-95 of all those goddamned Lincoln Geriatric Juggernauts that
are traveling 40 MPH with their left turn signals on.
