My track record on reading web pages is pretty poor (just as Phil
Tong!) but I didn't see any exemption for the green and super-green
(not the correct colors I think :) ) classes wrt to extinguishers on
the NER web page.  I do seem to recall a one-time exemption for
first-timers in the novice group.  I suspect that there is no
exemption beyond the first event. So, while I will be in the
super-green accident-waiting-to-happen class I'm not interested in a
one-time fix.  (or maybe I should just wait and see if I've got metal
to mount an extinguisher to after the first event... :) )

>Not the most desirable solution, but better than ripping apart your

Phil Tong and John White (among one or two others) have suggested a
seat bracket.  I'm going to take a look at John's next week.  I'll
post to the list when I've found the solution that works for me as
others might be interested.

But don't hold your breath guys and girls.  I'm not in a rush so it'll
likely be a few weeks before I get back to yaw'll.

In any case, thanks to all those on the list who responded with advice
and urls and answered my questions and re-read the web page for me
(thanks Phil) and have caused me to get no work done to day :)

Also, humorous comments above not-withstanding, I'm not planning on
trying to break any records, I will listen very carefully to the
instructor, and I'll take it nice and easy for a long while.  The
Beast may be all paid for but it looks a lot better shiny side up.
