Dave Roberts said that he is impressed with a Porsche battery...that the owner
must really care about maintenance, etc., etc.

The only thing that a Porsche battery would tell me is that the owner likes to
be taken by the factory over and over again.  I am not impressed by the fact
that you've had to replace your battery twice within the warranty period.
What if you'd had the battery for 25 months?  Tough luck, right?

I had a genuine Porsche battery that lasted 13 months (it only had a 12 month
warranty).  What a piece of junk!  Sears, Interstate, and a whole slew of
other batteries are far superior to what you get from Porsche.

George, don't buy a Porsche battery unless you want to flush your money down
the drain...stick with Sears or Interstate.
