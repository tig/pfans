<<Also, I don't think comparing a $4,600.00 Porsche bicycle to a Ferrari
F-50
is a valid analogy anymore than I think a Porsche designed wristwatch
for
$300.00 is a good analogy to a Casio that costs $40.00 and runs forever,
and quite possibly makes them for Porsche. One of them is a bicycle that
happens to have disk brakes and shock absorbing suspension.  The other
is
arguably,  the most fantastic street machine ever made.  Essentially a
slightly detuned Formula One machine with fenders.  Only the McClaren
comes close and that costs almost twice as much and has yet to prove
itself.>

Gene, 
At the risk of speaking for someone else, I think the point of the
Porsche bike/F50 comparo was to say that if you can afford it and you
think it's worth the money then why not.  It really isn't anyone else's
business.  Kind of like saying that your Casio watch does the same thing
as my Rolex, so why spend the extra money.  Well, because a Casio watch
is not a Rolex, and some people buy things for different reasons than
you.  If someone can afford a Porsche mountain bike let them buy it and
you wave from your $300 Trek as they ride by.  Then you and I will have
more money for cigars and microbrew beer!
Is Porsche a mountain bike company?  No.  But neither is Lotus and they
produced one of the best 12 speed bikes ever available for purchase. 
The point is that as long as people aren't spending YOUR money don't
worry about who's doing what.  Let them keep buying Porsche approved
parts and yapping about it on the list.  (*WARNING - This logic could
also carry over into welfare, public schools, and the government funding
of "art," so I digress).
