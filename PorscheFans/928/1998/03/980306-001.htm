OK I hear you guys still talking about the noise that I hear coming from
probably the fuel pump.  Just to get things straight,  I only hear the
noise at certain times.  It is not a continuous buzz like should be heard
from a fuel pump.  When either giving very light throttle or sometimes
during idle I hear a very noticeable buzzing toward the right rear.  It
should be about 1-3 weeks before I can get the car in to do the timing belt
and check the noise out also, but I will let ya know what it turns out to
be.  I had a buddy that was riding in the passenger seat that said he could
actually feel it!  My guess is that at a certain rate the pump is creating
a vibration and the mounts are loose.(along with clogged filter)  I can't
wait to see just how far off I probably am.
