Completely understandable Sterling!!!  Especially after
those
grueling days/nights in the high tech industry you just want
everything to work as it's supposed to!

You should have heard me when first my fuel pump when DOA
one night, had to leave the car out in the open, then
retrieved it from the shop the following day and then the
*next* day after that the clutch hose burst!  Good thing I
didn't have the same tow truck driver it would've been too
much.  A bit later the shift cup failed but I got lucky and
it popped back in enough to get me home.  The swap was a
real PITA though (no one rib me on the hose clamp ok, karma
thing ya know!).

Our cars are the same vintage and the "onus is upon us" to
service the wearable items now (time allowing) to stay ahead
of the MTBF curve.  I've been a little lax lately enjoying
the ride but next on the to do list is new brake lines.  I
most certainly need to R&R the upper/lower hoses and should
probably do all drive belts too while I'm in there.

Ok, back to the master cylinder - after I had my hose
swapped, I
noticed the clutch pedal would seem to stick midway through 
the travel.  I had it rebled but no change.  However it
doesn't
stick anymore and when it (air bubble?) freed itself I
didn't notice.
So that is one thing to watch for.

Keep the faith - your S4 will reward your hard work!
