When my tank's venting was fixed, the buzz became mellow (and quiet), the
"whoosh" when removing the gas cap disappeared, and it became much easier
to truly fill the tank (gauge indicating at or very near full). At least
check this before recalibrating your gauge, which may well be reading
accurately anyway.

By the way, before the problem was fixed, the buzzing wasn't always loud.
It took a long, hard drive, during which the engine was looking for more
fuel than the pump could supply.

Meanwhile, if you've been operating for a long time without venting, there
is a possibility that the tank is partially collapsed from having a vacuum
drawn in it. This would also affect capacity, but probably not prevent the
gauge from indicating full.
