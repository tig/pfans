Hi all:

I got to tell you, 928 fans are the best.  A bunch of us sharkers got
together at Devek for lunch yesterday - some new transplants like Elliot
Nowacky (drove up from Monterey!)  and Carlos Hernandez (shark hunting
and getting closer), some locals like me & David Sidwell (new GT owner!)
and our hosts Susan and Marc (of course Zonker who gave everyone the
once over too - whoa, big dog!).

Of course the laying of the hands occured on a soon to be Devek massaged
engine that was on the bench.  We all perused some outa sight! welding
that had been performed, and I pointed out the bank offset to Carlos. 
The biggest news was a black wide body Marc is breathing life into. 
Watch for the details on this car!

Elliot kindly treated us to 928 get-together photos from the great state
of Texas and some race video too.  To me, this was a magnaminous (sp?)
gesture to reveal all that the unblinking camera eye records in the
cockpit.  I think it was worth it for all of us to see his, as well as
the other 928's in action (hi James! Carl!  Judy! some more but I
forgot!)  Marc offered gear selection hints and you can bet we all took
it to heart.  The high point was watching Elliot pass a 5-series bimmer
on the right - GO ELLIOT!  Rewind, watch it again - GO ELLIOT!  We all
whooped too seeing James Morrison lay rubber onto the approach road out
of the pits!

Yup, a mighty fine day in 928 land.

I hope to see as many of you all as possible in Monterey August 14 -
16.  I now have a huge Porsche banner thanks to James Zapanta, Madison
Gunter, Ted Reyes and Tim Arcuri to fly over (our section of?) the
corral.  Thanks guys!

Get your sharks in gear and BE THERE!  You can bet this will be The
World's Largest Gathering of Porsches of every flavor bar none - a once
in a lifetime event!?! 
Phil Tong
