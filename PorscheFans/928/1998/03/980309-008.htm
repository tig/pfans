(Howard wrote) With all the wax postings, no one has mentioned the
"Carnauba Wax" that Griot's Garage sells... Griot's says its got the
highest concentration of carnauba that can still be workable (30% as I
recall). Its not a cleaning wax, just wax. Has anyone compared this to
Zymol, which appears to be the early leader heading into the clubhouse
turn, by my informal count?

Larry Reynolds at Car Care specialties could give Richard Griot quite an
education on car detailing.  In fact he knew Richard when he was making
wax in his mom's kitchen.  There is a reason he's the closest thing to
being the official PCA wax/detailing item provider.  Griot's Garage do
not manufacture wax at all, they resell someone else's.  How did you
determine that Zymol "appears to be the early leader", I thought Brian
was it's only proponent and I'm seriously considering giving him some
Blitz.  (less than $20 for more than 8 oz I think)
