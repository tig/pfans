Hello fellow shark owners!!

Just got some important information from the organizer of the Porsche Corral
at the Monterey Historics this August that I wanted to pass on to all of you.

If you decide to participate in the corral portion of the Historics get you
money in NOW. There are  just a few corral spots left and David Fuhrmann,
the event organizer anticipates all corral slots being sold out within the
next two weeks. This means that almost 700 applications have been received
so far!!! Info is availible in the February issue of PANORAMA and also at
www.pca.org.

If you already sent in your application did all of you who entered indicate
that you were a 928 owner?? All cars will be grouped by model so all 928s
will be together. David indicated to me that several applications have been
received with no model designation on them. If you've entered and are not
sure if you indicated model type 928, suggest you call David Fuhrmann at
408-626-3306 and verify that you are a 928 owner and want to be all the
other sharks.

Happy 928ing and I hope to see a lot of you in August!!!!!
