Daniel,

I obviously misunderstood your previous message.  I thought you meant that
it was normal to do that all the time, because, as I said, I've been
driving 928s and indeed, all models of Porsches as long as they've made
them and this never happened to any of them.. 

Your explanation makes sense.  However, I don't know if you saw Tom Green's
post to me yesterday or the day before, in which he said that he had
replaced the entire resistor pack and yet his car still did the same thing.
 Can you think of any other possible reason and/or cure for this happening?
 If so, you'll be a hero to the group. Leonard Laub and Phil Tong have
assured me that they will personally chip in and buy you a new Boxster. 

Did you check out my possible explanation for your difficulties getting
connected to the list?

Gene
