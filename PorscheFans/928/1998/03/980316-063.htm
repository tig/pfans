A story that may add something to the Gene O'Rourke story
posted yesterday.  

I bought my 84 928S in about June of last year.  The PO had the
Disk wheels with really bad rubber, 4 refinished phone dial wheels
with winter rubber, and a new set of P700 ZR's.  My first weekend, 
I began calling various places to get a time slot for mounting
and balancing the new P700 on the disk wheels.  I ended up going
to the place that the PO had his work done - He also has 2 Ferrari
Dinos and a nice selection of other collectable cars (retirement
fund).  My 928 was his daily driver.  I figured that if he trusted
his collection to this guy, so could I.  Got all 4 tires into the 
back and drove over.  After about an hour or so, out came my car 
with the new tires mounted.  Got it home and did the soap 'n brush
thing to get em looking nice and noticed that the tread pattern on
the drivers rear was different that the other 3.  I promptly got on 
the phone, and talked to the owner.  He said that he would be happy
to swap them but I would have to wait till tomorrow, so I set it up
for my next Saturday.  He said he would be out of town, and to talk
to his son.  Next Saturday, I drove over and talked to Sonny.  He 
was polite, but I could tell that he had no desire to unmount/remount
the tire just because I didn't like the way the tread pattern looked.

He insisted that the P700 has no direction indicated.  What was I
supposed to do, tell him his business?  He's supposed to be the 
expert but I insisted anyway.  Out comes the car, and the boy wonder
had the wrong tire flipped.  Now I had 2 treads in one direction and
2 the other.  I went back in, and pointed out his mistake, and told
him to correct the problem again.  In my car goes for another 20 min.
When it came out, Much to my disbelief, he had simply moved like tires
to each side.  I thought about it for a minute, but decided to leave
because someone would have keyed my car if I sent it back in a third
time.  I never corrected the problem - first snowfall, and 3 near 
misses on the road, and I pulled out the winter tires and jack.

Didn't have any problem until I got to the drivers rear tire.  I
couldn't budge them.  I actually broke my breaker bar trying.  Got
in touch with a mechanic friend, and borrowed his giant breaker bar
and electric ratchet.  By now it was 10 PM and the ratchet was 
making a hell of a noise but even after 10 minutes on one lug, it
was as tight as before.  I started leaning on the breaker bar with
all my weight  (its a craftsman, so I didn't care)  Finally got 
a 8' piece of pipe to add a little torque.  Broke the cap right off
leaving a small bit of the lug behind.  To cut my loss, the next 
evening I went over to my mechanic and he worked on them for about 
20 minutes.  Got 2 off, completely rounded off one, and broke another 
cap off.  I'm now thinking about the tire monkey at the shop and what
was going through his mind as he cranked the crap out of the lug nuts
on that wheel - The guy with the Porsche is WAY too picky about his
tread pattern, so I'll teach him a lesson or two.

The Porsche dealer said he would do it but wouldn't guarantee that
the wheel wouldn't be damaged after they got done.  I figured if anyone
was going to damage my wheel, it would be me.  

SOLUTION:
Get a 11/16 metal-cutting hole saw.  You may need to grind the interior
of the hole saw so that it fits snug on the stud - test it on a stud,
it will fit like a glove if you grind it properly.  Slide the saw on
a good stud and mark your depth carefully, you dont want to grind any of
your wheel away by accident.  I used a spray lubricant with a plastic
straw, and contantly lubricated the stud and cutter.  Cut slowly and
carefully to avoid any miss-alignment of the teeth - as the softer
metal is removed, the saw will travel down the length of the stud and
not damage the threads.  To remove 3 nuts, it took about 3 hours, 4
beers, and 2 hole saws.  After I pulled the wheel, I purchased a 14mm
die, 1.5 pitch.  Tightened the die on each stud, and all the left-over
aluminum stuck in the threads pealed off without any trouble.  Put a
little anti-seize compound on the threads and I was back in business.

I sent a letter to my tire monkey friend and used quite colorfull
explatives in my assessment of his future in the tire business.

Does this successfull procedure qualify me for the honorable
title of Der Porsche Dentist?

Sorry for the length...
