>Seems most powerful while still warming up- although I can't bring

checks

>Frequently- but not always, the engine coughs once or not at all and

pedal-
>otherwise it loads up and floods requiring WOT to start.

>R.P.M.s will occasionally falter when coming to a set of lights and

>Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated- especially any that can be
