Ok, so I finally pulled the wheel to check the tank.  The tank & pump
are within the driver's rear wheelwell, tire must come off.  Remove the
panel at the rear of the wheelwell.  See tank way up there?  Not much
fluid difference between min / max but the real problem is filling it -
need a squeeze bulb or pump or something or you'll never reach it!

My level was fine so I didn't touch it and therefore didn't look up
fluid specs.  Think it called for DOT 3 or 4 brake fluid but need to see
manuals so don't take my word for it.  Good level doesn't explain why I
get periodic errors from the computer so a troubleshootin' I will go
later.

Everything underneath the car looks good albeit covered with road
filth.  Brake lines make a couple of 180's, stock routing too but I like
the idea of the spiral wire support.  No line cracks detected but they
look old as the hills and will be replaced with OEM spec (not blazing
any trails here).  That will make three fluid flushes in less than a
year for me!  Time for SuperBlue?

Speaking of brakes, while all pads look fine and sensors intact, the
black caliper paint is peeling here and there.  How about brilliant
yellow calipers!  Ok just kidding.

After inspecting my undercarriage, I think all concours folks have too
much time on their hands!  Though I sure wouldn't mind cleaning
everything off just to see the components and applying new cosmoline,
etc.  Whew.  It is probably too late for this car for that type of
work... it's a driver afterall!

Be good to yourself and your shark!
Phil
