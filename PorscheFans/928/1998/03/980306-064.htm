	Howard Prost and all,

	When doing a patch job make sure it will be as good as original, or even 
better!  Some things can be replaced or patched some just can't.  My 
alternater broke off the engine block, that was patched with JB weld. 
That  was a quality patch job it took a week to do, the bolts thread into 
metal, the aluminum was cleaned with a carbid grider, the glue is spread 
over a large enough area to distribute the loading.  If the alternater 
were to hit something again hopefully there will be no more block damage. 
 After I ripped my spoiler and grill off making a U turn, I replaced the 
plastic vertical grill parts with aluminum.  

	The catch tank, you could patch with epoxy or something and then start 
looking for a good used one, I would not consider any patch on the 
cooling system permanent.  Lets not forget we have a $8,000 car with a 
$10,000 engine!  Not much will really stick to some plastics and most 
things that will won't take the heat for very long.  One of the side 
tanks on my radiater started to leak, cracked under one of the top 
mounts.  I tried epoxy, lasted a week, I wasn't trying for a permanent 
solution.  Come spring (may) the 928 comes off the road for several 
repairs, the 914 has no heat!  The glue turns to jelly in a week, it 
creates a slow leak.  I don't think the JB weld will stick to plastic, 
but it will take the heat, so last night I mixed the hobby poxy and the 
JB weld.  If you are very handy you could make a new tank out of aluminum 
or brass,  the $100. replacement gives some options.  You would need to 
start with a junk radiater, for the radiater cap fitting (check Hemmings 
motor news, maybe you can buy just part of the radiater).  A radiater 
shop might be able to make a tank.  A aluminum tank could be 
patched/repaired, you can weld aluminum!  Lets be honest, if you saw a 
aluminum catch tank in a 928 would it really drop the value of the car? 
Ok its not original, but if it was a quality job, it would work just 
fine!  My windshield washer tank used to leak out the passenger fender, 
fixed that with epoxy, but that don't get HOT, and if it leaks who 
cares.....

	I patched my leather seats with some matching fabric and epoxy, it was 
free and it looks alot better.  A friend works at a fabric store, she 
gave me the fabric.  The fabric that is coming off the rear panels, use 
epoxy and clamp with cloths pins.  There is no harm is this type of 
patch, if the next owner wants to recover the seats the patches won't 
cause a problem.  That rear hatch floor cover original is about  $100 
bucks, a fabric store can make one for fifty bucks! 

	Again if doing a patch repair do a quality job, half the work I have 
done is correcting stuff the PO did.  If I sound like a hack you should 
have seen some of what he did!
