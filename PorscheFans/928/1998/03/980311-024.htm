For those of you who are book freaks as well as 928 freaks:  This afternoon
I came across "Inside 100 Great Cars"  all two page cut away spreads.  Hard
cover, 8 1/2 X 11 1/2, 287 pages. Three of them were Porsches, a 356, 911,
and what appears to be an 86 928S. The high quality, four color graphics
alone, are more than worth the price.  There's also a thumbnail description
of each car; much of which illustrates, unfortunately, the writer's
ignorance of the  928.  I don't say this in a mean spirited way, he had to
write about 100 cars, most of which he'd probably never driven, many of
which  he'd probably never seen, and had to be going largely on hearsay.
It is however, a book that I'm sure most of you would enjoy. 

Published by the Crescent Book division of Random House;  
http:/  /www.randomhouse.comm/   I came across it in "Books-A-Million in
West Palm Beach.  I would imagine that Barnes & Noble or Border's would
also have it.  Lists for about $50.00.  Books-A-Million member's price
$22.50. Have a look.
