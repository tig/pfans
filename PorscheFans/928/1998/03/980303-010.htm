For Tom Weigand:  

My requirements for tires are that they cover a variety of weather
conditions, because I use the 928 year round.  I am on the coast of Maine,
where our winters are, well, challenging at least.  

I put new tires on the car in the fall, and after MUCH debate and hand
wringing, I chose Dunlop SP4000 all season (Z rated).  The choice was either
those or Yokohama AVS S4.  The all season rating was the driving factor,
because after the first of October we often won't see ambient temperatures
above 45 for six months.  Softer compounds become like concrete, and add a
little moisture to the pavement and you can have sideways Shark.

While I don't look for snowy conditions, I have had to drive my car in some
pretty bad weather when it caught me with the 928 away from home.  In
addition, I have used the car a good deal in the rain, with temperatures in
the lower thirties.  I have found the Dunlops to be an excellent choice.

Yesterday, I went to Portland for the second time in five days.  The trip is
about 375 miles round trip, and includes a considerable stretch of two lane,
twisty road that is rough and rutted with frost heaves, and a 125 mile
stretch of interstate which gets smoother the further south I go.  The car
is remarkably quiet at all speeds, and the handling on all surfaces is sure
and precise.  Yesterday's trip included about 100 miles of interstate trying
to make up time, so I was maintaining something above 85.  The wind noise
over the windshield is louder than the tires, and normal conversation is
pleasant all the way to 115 which is as fast as I have gone in the car.

All in all, I am VERY satisfied with the Dunlops.  Their price and handling
in all weather was precisely what I wanted and needed.  Would I buy another
set?  Probably not.
Next time, which will likely be next fall, I will want to try something
else...maybe the Yokos.

I bought my tires from Tirerack, and they were shipped directly to my
mechanic for mounting.  Both Tirerack and Discount Tire Direct had the
tires, but when I was placing the order, Tirerack was open, which is why I
chose them.  I have used both.

Just my experience for what it is worth.
