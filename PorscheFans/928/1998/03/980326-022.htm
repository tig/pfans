>Does the 86.5 have the 288 HP engine or the 316 HP?

US 928s cars for model years '85 and '86 have five-liter, four-cam,
32-valve engines rated at 288 bhp. The '87+ 928S4 cars have a revised
version of that engine rated at 316 bhp.

>If it has the 288 HP engine what did they change to get the extra HP?

One major difference is the intake plumbing. The S4 engine's intake
contains a flap which adjusts the lengths of the tubes to change their
resonant frequencies, this permits optimizing performance for both low rpm
(one flap position) and high rpm )the other flap position) operation.  The
flap flips as engine speed goes through about 3000-3500 rpm. This keeps the
torque curve unusually flat, but creates a characteristic small dip in that
curve at the speed where the flap moves.

The real benefit of this change is that the engine responds strongly at
almost any speed, certainly any speed above 3000 rpm. It develops more
torque overall (max is 317 lb ft at 3000 rpm, compared to 302 at 2700 for
the older engine), but it maintains high torque up to a higher engine
speed, providing two reasons for higher peak horsepower (316 bhp at 6000
rpm v. 288 at 5750).

>Also - my current understanding is that
>the pre-87's cannot take a performance chip - is that true?

Not entirely. Porsche started using the LH-Jetronic engine control system
with the '84 Euro (not US) 928S, and put it in all cars from '85 forward.
This system uses a digital computer which can be reprogrammed, but the
optimal program will be different for different engine models. A chip set
(one each for fuel and ignition) for an S4 will not be optimal for a US S.
