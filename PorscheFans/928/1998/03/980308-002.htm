Uncharacteristically, I was not running on "Tong time" today as I found
myself heading over to 3Com park when I'd usually still be sleeping
soundly.  Made in it for the AM sessions.

Purpose-built 914's were spanking everyone with lap times in the 52's, I
believe TTOD went into 51's with Tom Provasi at the controls! 
Untouchable.

*Really* fast 911 territory was 53's or so, 'regular' fast was anything
sub-60 seconds - and trust me, that is really honking through the
course!!!  Frustrating many drivers 911 or otherwise was a young girl
piloting a red 911 cab into the 57's right off the bat.  

Thank god Jim Murphy cracked that barrier with his 57.775 top lap time,
as Alan and I were straddled with 62's+ - non-eventful and no 180's at
least.  In the last run period in the rain, my lap times stayed in the
mud with a couple of 65+  but still no spins.  No one broke parts either
so we all merely jumped in our cars and drove home after picking up the
course cones. 

So down goes my first AX this year.  I still have trouble reading the
course (cone blind syndrome!?) and was throttle-shy (first time I've
ever driven slaloms and there were two on course) but hope AX school and
instruction will better my ability to adapt.

All in all a fun day, though very cold, and not any harder on the car
than what I do on the street (big reason times sucked too?).  

Getting...addicted...to...driving events!  Recommend if you haven't
tried it yet to do at least one or two, it's fast, safe and fun.  The
experience definately helps too!
