Subject: 928 vs Vet

Does anyone know about any tests that may have been performed comparing
performance/reliability/etc. between same year Porsche 928s and
Corvettes?  I've been pursuing that elusive 928 for well over a month
now and they are one of the most difficult cars to get your hands on.  I
live in the DC area and anytime an ad hits the paper, it is sold within
a day or two.  I found this dealership that had one that someone had
traded in but they sold it the same day.

Isn't this interesting...I would suggest www.traderonline, Panorama,
Porsche Market Letter, and Brian Buxton.  928's fro sale seem to move
slow in here in Atlanta.  Since it's a big investment you'll have to
live with a long time, take your time, have it professionally examined
by both 928 garage and a body shop, hold out for one that's been stored
indoors, and expect to say "Sorry but this isn't the car I'm looking
for" as many times as nessasary.

As for the question, is like comparing what Fred Flintstone drove to
ultra tight, ricket and rattle free, deadly smooth and comfortable
supercar with Mercedes build quality. No comparison if quality is at all
a consideration.  Compare the grade of plastics in the interior,
aluminum and steel perfect fitting body panels vs terrible fiberglass
misery (talk to body shops about fiberglass repair) ah the list goes on
you get the point.
