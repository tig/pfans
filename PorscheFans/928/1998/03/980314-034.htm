Dear Phil and Jim,

I have picked up some comments that were made when Phil replied to Jim =
dobbins, question about disabling the Tire Pressure Monitoring system.

1. I am collecting a 1989 model 5spd S4 early next week, which has =
widened rear arches and 17" cup aloys which are wider than the original =
S4 wheels.
This car is fitted with an electronic dash (no machanical odometer) and =
is displaying a tyre pressure warning, which can be quickly dismissed by =
flicking the computer function selection lever.=20
I would appreciate being able to disable the warning completely, I have =
got a copy of a fix from the 928 fans web site but don't know if it's =
right for this particular model. I'd welcome a solution specific to the =
VIN number, which is: WPOzzz92zKS840210.

2. I noticed Phil's comment about the dash: "Note the readouts can be
set for english, french, german in addition to US mph or r.o.w. kph =
etc."
Phil, do you or any body else know how to do this, as the computer dash =
on my proposed 928 is all in German and KPH, the only item I'd be left =
with is the KPH calibrated analogue speedometer dial.

3. I posted a request recently on how to disable the catalytic =
converter, which it has been suggested is breaking up, one scare story =
is that fragments of ceramic could be sucked back into the engine. I =
have received the following suggestion:
a. Remove the catalyst section of the exhaust and knocking out the =
ceramic catalyst with a rod or rubber mallet, then refit the empty pipe.
b. Some people say, that the Oxygen sensor then needs to be disabled, =
does anyone know the procedure for this?

Many thanks in advance

Nigel Hooker.

Hi Jim:


What is your VIN number?  You obviously have the computerized dash-
indicating a 1990 or newer model 928.  Is your car a US model?  Are the
rest of the computer messages in English or ?  Note the readouts can be
set for english, french, german in addition to US mph or r.o.w. kph etc.

I would gather to say that if your car is not running the OEM wheels
with the RDK sensors then naturally you are seeing the RDK warnings. Yes
there is a work around, it's not always perfect and not warrantied.=20
Would like more info on your car before continuing.

Phil Tong
