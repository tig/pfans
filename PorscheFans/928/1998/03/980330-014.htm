Congratulations Moira.  I just read my e-mail and your post reminded me o=

6 months ago when mine first came in. I also had a loud buzzing coming fr=
om
the back and replaced my fuel pump which made it much quieter but it stil=
l
has a slight buzz.  The PO had removed the carpet insulation though, so I=

am going to buy some and I believe that should take care of it.  Even wit=
h
all the niggling idiosynchrasies, the car is phenomenal and still pinch

Phil,

I thought I was the only wierdo that would rather have the stereo off to
listen to the sound the car makes.  I listen to every new sound and
consistently monitor what is going on. The strange part is.., I love it!!=
