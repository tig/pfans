I don't know about the rest but I'm with you.  I'm truly amazed at
the number of wannabes who try to out-run me at stop lights.  Since I
drive the VW Scirocco most of the time I've got pretty good data on
what the 928 does to people when I pull up along side them at stop
lights.

Yesterday, I had someone in a GrandAm GT (for God sakes) try to get
the jump on me by easing forward as soon as the opposing traffic light
finished it's yellow. He then tried to push me out of my lane by
cutting across my left front. (Luckily for him I was already out of
the way... )

Nuke'em from orbit Pat. It's the only way to be sure.
