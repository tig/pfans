I thought it was a Ferrari. It wasn't good looking enough to be a Porsche. We all
know that if it was a Porsche, the Pontiac wouldn't have had a chance to eat the
Porsche. The sidewinders would've been fired long before dinner time. Then the
Porsche would've lit the JATO (or RATO) and been so far above the speed limit that a
radar detector would be useless. The cop would look up from his coffee and doughnut
just in time to see "*err*" on the radar and hear the sonic boom.

I've seen this several times. I think it is proof of the stupidity of the average
American.

the speed and armament down on ground-based vehicles.)
