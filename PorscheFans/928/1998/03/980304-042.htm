>>Some posted a note with the following text:
>>
>>>We race 3 cars with them.  All have had line failures. Fortunately 
>>never at speed.
>>* One failure was as we left tech inspection @ a Sebring Club race.
>>
>>I dunno, maybe I have my head up my ass, but I just don't get it! 
>> There is *no* performance improvement to be had with these stupid s/s 
>>hoses.  Why the hell do people on this list (who I assume to have some

>>*never* had a rubber line fail.
