To would be 928S owners!!!

There is a 86 928S for sale at a sports car dealer in Monterey.

I looked at the car this afternoon. It's Granite Red Metallic, 81K, Tan
interior, dunlop tires. I also looked carefully at the engine. It has a
coolant leak at the o-ring water intake and it appears there is some kind of
fuel leak somewhere. I could smell the fumes immediately when I opened the
hood. Interior is in good condition.
 
The dealer is asking $15,900. This includes a limited warranty. Too much for
a car with a coolant leak and fuel leak!!

If anyone is interested in this car let me know and I can take a closer look
at it for you, test drive etc.  

Happy shark hunting!!
