Vince...

Just a point of interest re: plasma coating.  I've heard that it works very
well and improves braking (better coefficient of friction?).

Also of interest, I had all 3 brake rotors on my H-D drilled and chrome
plated...I figured if I couldn't stop any way, might as well have good looking
rotors.  Two things happened, first the chrome never seemed to wear, just the
mildest indications of scuffing, and second, the braking was maybe better, but
certainly no worse than before the plating.  Brake pad wear was normal also.

Everybody I had asked about this beforehand said that the braking would be
significantly reduced...they were wrong.
