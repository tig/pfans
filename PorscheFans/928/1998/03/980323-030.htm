<<Hey Brian, when listing the 928's you have for sale, could you also
include the price. Better yet, could you list the price you paid for
them and your markup/range ? This would give us a better indication of
the true market value of these cars.>>

Richard,
An idea I have never thought of!  I know that all the dealers around
here in my area volunteer all the information regarding their deals to
anyone who asks.  How about this, I'll gladly give that info to anyone
who buys a car from me, provided they give me copies of their tax papers
for the last 5 years.  That way I'll be able to decide if I've charged
them fairly.  I think my new system will be as follows:  I'll make my
profit based on my customers income.  Ten percent sounds good to me. 
After all, if you make over $100,000 a year you can afford to give me
$10,000 for my troubles.  And I'm also making a change to my business. 
Instead of the initials BMI, I'm changing them to IRS, just to make sure
no-one is misled.

Seriously though Richard, read what you wrote.  Does that make sense to
you?  What I charge for 928's definitely does not establish what 
"market valuie" is.  That only establishes what I'm selling a particular
car for, and I can tell you, I'm much cheaper.  Or you can ask any of my
previous customers.  Most dealers will not sell a car for any less than
a 10% profit on what they have invested in the car.  I will.  And I'll
gladly give market info on 928's to anyone who asks, but not every
detail of my business.  How much money do you make each year Richard? 
How much do you owe and to whom?  Anyone who has bought a car from me
knows my cars are well below the "market value" of other dealers, and
they all know I bend over backwards to try to make the customer happy. 
If you don't think I give good deals then don't buy from me.  Your loss
though.  If you're curious about my prices check the newspapers and the
Internet.  Do a comparison of what I have with cars equal in mileage,
condition, etc.  My cars, prices and individual service are the best. 
Period.  And just FYI, I have never made more than $5,900 on any one
deal.  And to all my past customers out there cringing, no it wasn't a
Porsche.  It was one of those fancy Italian jobbies.            =)
Brian Buxton

P.S.  Richard, please don't take my letter the wrong way, I actually
tried to interject some humor.  I've just never had such a request
before from anyone with a straight face.
