Ah, crap...I'm getting caught in a spelling flame. Ye of faint heart,
hit delete now. I was flamed in a public place so I feel the urge
to respond there. For clarity, I will forgo my crusty, old, habitual
TeX-like quoting of `` and '' (in case you ever noticed) and use the
ASCII double-quote character (").

Oh...wiseguy, eh? :-) The two most widely-accepted style manuals in
(admittedly) the United States, the _Associated Press Stylebook_ and the
_Chicago Manual of Style_ disagree. I would have assumed a style manual
addresses these issues explicitly while it is only cursory to the purpose
of a dictionary. All block quotes in this article are from AP. (I blocked
'em so they stand out clearly and are not confused with my own examples
in double-quotes.)

    FIGURES: Add s: The custom began in the 1920s. The airline has two
    727s. [...]

The first example could have been written with a Y2K bug as "'20s". Would
you actually have us write "'20's"? "20's" is clearly incorrect if you're
abbreviating "1920s" as the missing letters are before the 2.

> in several M.D.'s, 3's" - Webster's College Dictionary

Yucky...I was unaware of this *huge* controversy. I figured if AP and
Chicago agreed, it must be a fact. Oh well. AP goes on to explicitly
contradict Webster:

    (No apostrophes, an exception to Webster's New World guideline under
    "apostrophe.")

It contradicts similarly when using words as words. "No ifs, ands
or buts."

You just wrote it! Take careful aim and note the subtle differences
between "928s" and "928 S". Have two? They're 928 S's.

    SINGLE LETTERS: Use 's: Mind your p's and q's. [...]

Grrr! I hate this crummy, illogical language! I suppose you have several
928 S4s, GTs and GTSs, just to confuse the matter. Hey, I don't make up
these lousy rules.

> all like to know in order to prevent this horror from ever taking place

Sorry, but I've become somewhat of a pedant. As software
developer/engineer, I work with a fairly illiterate bunch. I have
somewhat overstated my case, but I just couldn't help throwing that in.
So, who's right in Webster vs. AP/Chicago? I guess no one cares.

The content of my article stated that I've found "Porsh" to be used
out of laziness or hubris. Never as a term of endearment as in Bimmer
and Vee-dub.
