This is my first post to the list so please be patient with me.  I
purchased an '81 928 last year and I have slowly been fixing it up.  I
repaired the rear hatch wiper motor but was surprised when pressing the
center console activation switch would only engage the wiper for two
passes of the window.  Happy that it worked at all, I thought nothing
more of it.  At the time I figured that the switch might be broken as
holding it down would result in continuous operation of the wiper (a
little difficult while driving, especially with a standard).  I put this
on my list of things to repair and went on enjoying the car.

While doing some work in the center console, I noticed burned wires
coming from the rear wiper switch where the leads connect into the
harness.   The red lead splits into two wires on the harness side of the
connector.  These two wires are black with a violet (Bluish/Purple
anyway) stripe.  One of these wires had most of the insulation burned
off and had melted into the other.

Coincidentally, I was also in the process of removing the instrument
cluster (yes this car needs much work!)  I am amazed to find another
melted down wire that is also black with a violet stripe.  It is beside
a plain black wire and both are bundled together and have very small
female spade connector ends.  They are attached to nothing and I cannot
find anything to which they connect.  They exit the harness adjacent to
the intermittent wiper control wheel and, based on their length and
placement it would seem that they should connect there.  There are two
spade style connectors on the control and they both have healthy looking
yellow wires attached with significantly larger spade ends.  I can tell
however that something bad has happened underneath here because the
aluminum ignition locking tube is burned directly below the wire.  There
is no sign of where any missing component may have been mounted, the
only possible clue being a piece of electrical tape wrapped around the
locking tube that has been cleanly sliced and left hanging.

When I bridged the plain black wire with the black/violet one I could
hear a clicking which I traced over to the intermittent wiper relay in
the fuse panel.  I tried isolating and testing the remaining wires but
couldn't figure out what was really happening with the circuit.

I don't know if
    a)    The console switch is broken.  (As I mentioned previously,
pressing it only sends out a momentary burst of current  activating the
wiper relay which quickly times out and parks the wiper)
    b)    One of the relays are burned out.  (I doubt this because even
if a single pulse of electricity activates the relay, what then
deactivates it?)
    c)    I don't know if my problem is associated to the burned wires
and the possible missing component under the instrument cluster or if
this is a separate problem which would only affect the rear wiper
operating in an intermittent setting.

Any help would sure be appreciated.

Thanks
