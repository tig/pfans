"Tourist delivery at the Porsche factory is where customers may pick up
their new car.  The customer is briefed on their new Porsche and is
shown the vehicle production areas in Zuffenhausen where these Porsches
are built.  In the engine area of the production plant, a customer can
see where engine specialists weigh the pistons and connecting rods, and
assemble them into matched sets that are ideally balanced for the
individual engines.

" When the engines are finished, each goes on to one of the 25
dynamometers for about half of an hour for break-in and check-out; it
has to be completely up to Porsche's performance standards before
installation in a car.  This never fails to impress customers, who peer
through windows at Porsche engines making sounds just as if they were
out on a country road."
