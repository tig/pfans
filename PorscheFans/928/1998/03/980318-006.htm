Greg,

Great write-up!  Enjoyed reading it.  I'll add it to my archives (even
though my car's an auto, I'd like to get a manual S4 someday).

I'm jealous!  You're driving your car again and mine's still up on jack
stands.  ;-)   I'm hoping to drive mine again by the end of the month.

Glad your "operation" was successful, sounds like you've really done
some good stuff.

I'm gonna be replacing my O2 sensor also.  I bought the Bosch one, not
realizing that I'd have to change connectors.  It was only about $20
less than the Porsche one, I wish I had bought it instead now.  Did you
use the OEM Porsche one?  I'll be interested to see if it helps my car
any, it never did idle a real smooth.
