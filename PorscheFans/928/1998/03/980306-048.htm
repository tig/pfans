It IS possible to be clocked from behind.  In *most* cases the unit has to
be stationary.  There is at least one if not two or more units out there
that can track a vehicle moving away from the patrol car even while the
patrol car is in motion.  The buzzword is called "Same Lane RADAR".  One
big disadvantage is an extra step the officer/person has to perform when
operating the unit.  That is to decide if the target vehicle is traveling
faster or slower than the patrol vehicle.  Then they must flick a switch on
the unit that says "Faster" or "Slower" to accurately get a reading.  You
can see the potential problem already.  Nub said.

The doppler effect (shift) still works with traffic moving away.  The
frequency is just lowering instead of increasing.

Cosine error doesn't have an effect when the vehicle is moving straight
away or towards the RADAR unit.  Only on an angle.  And cosine error
usually benefits  the speeder by displaying a *lower* speed.  However it
can be a detriment if  the RADAR reads the patrol cars speed slower due to
cosine error.  Then the difference in the speeds would be ADDED to the
target vehicles speed.

But here in Michigan I've been hit several times RADAR from behind.  One of
those times I received a ticket.  He was hiding behind the concrete barrier
where it comes to an end.  When traffic goes shooting by he hits you in the
butt!  That's the last time I'll ever got a ticket at that wall.  Now I
look for the patrol cars antenna's when I approach that point.

As far as why have the detector in the rear such as the V-1 is simple.
It's just more information to the driver so you know how to react.  Another
example (hope I'm not boring people) is when I was giving a kid a ride in
my shark when the V-1 went off when I was approaching 100 mph.  The arrow
indicated the signal was coming from the rear.  When I looked in the
RE-view there was nothing to be seen.  So instead of slamming on the brakes
like I would 've with the other detectors (other than the V-1 or twin K-40
setup), I nailed it to get the hell away from the source.  My thoughts are
that a cop just turned onto the business loop that I was on about a 1/4
mile or more behind me.  Not to come after me but just was turning on.  I
sure wasn't going to stick around to find out though.

If you want to learn more about RADAR units, you can buy one from AIS in
Oklahoma.  Their number is (918) 962-3349.  I bought one.  And with the
experience of using one real world, you know a lot more on the TRUE
capabilities & limitations of them and therefore stand a little better
chance of knowing how to react to a signal.

Happy motoring!!!  Love this Porsche 928 tape!!!  :)

Pretty much the same when trying to clock a target moving perpedicularly to
radar emissions.
