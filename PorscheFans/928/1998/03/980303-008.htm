Phil, The car runs 13.85 - 13.95 range, depending on density altitude
and
traction on launch. MPH is in the 101 - 103 range.

Maybe if the motor had other significant mods the filter might help.

I talked to NOS about 2 weeks ago, they " claim " about 120HP for their
kit
on the 32 valve motors. The rep I spoke with stated "kit is a real pain
to 
install". Retail price was $795.00 with 10 lb. bottle.
I've used one of their kits on a 383 chevy smallblock, and you know it
when
the juice hits the motor!
