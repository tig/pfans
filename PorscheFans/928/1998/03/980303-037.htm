Can't help you with a good mechanic as I'm in San Diego, however - 

Most Porsche shops will do a Pre-Purchase Inspection of a car.  Typically
you need to make an appointment (mosy shops will get you in that day or the
next) - best to use a shop that has not done work on the car before fror a
more impartial analysis.  Make arrangements with the seller to bring the car
to the shop.  It will need to be there 2-4 hours.  The buyer should then
plan on meeting with the mechanic who did the inspection later in the day -
prefferably without the seller in attendance.  The mechanic should have a
list of findings and will usually indicate costs to fix any problems.  They
should have done a complete inspection of major systems and taken the car
for a test run.  Usual price for this service is around $50 plus an
additional $50 to do a compression test - recommended.  The mechanic will
then give you his personal overall opinion if you ask for it.  The BUYER
pays for this inspection.  Steer clear of any sellers that are not
enthusiastic about this pre-sale inspection.
The buyer can then use the information from the inspection to negotiate the
final selling price.

I personnaly brought three 928's in for this inspection before I purchased
my 79 convertible.  Sure I was out $300, but that's a drop in the bucket
compared to any major repairs.  And I was able to get the final price
dropped by almost $1000 to compensate for items that needed repair.


PS - I would have bet money that the S4 designation was related to
valves-per-cylinder.  Shows what a dork I am...
