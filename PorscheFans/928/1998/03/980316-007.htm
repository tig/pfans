Hi All,

I am the new owner of a 1990 928GT.  This is my third Porsche; the first
was an '87 944 Turbo, since sold (I really wanted a 928, but couldn't
find a decent one), the second Porsche was a '70 911S Targa, which I
still have, and now the 928GT. 

I previously owned 6 different Corvettes over the past 15 years,(I still
own one) and I autocross raced Corvettes for over 12 years (now
retired).  I originally became interested in Porsches several years ago,
I hate to admit, because having started a family, I now had two little
kids who loved to go to all kinds of car events with me. Many car events
are family events, and Porsches seat four, Corvettes seat two. My wife's
first comment when she saw the 928 was "it has rear shoulder belts".
Safety first! 

My present vehicles represent a variety of vehicular interests.  I
presently own a 68 Dodge Dart GTS 383 4 speed, a 69 Corvette 427
Roadster 4 speed, a 70 911S Euro Targa, and the 90 928GT.  My grocery
getter and winter car is a 96 Impala SS, and my wife has a 98 Volvo T5
Turbo(be wary of these shoe boxes, they really fly).  No garage queens
here.  All of the older cars have been driven in the past four weeks on
nice days, despite our winter weather.  Don't worry, I don't plan to
list all these cars in my signature salutation. 

First of all, many thanks to Phil Tong for his excellent info on the GT,
and his help checking the numbers out. I located the car in Toronto
Canada, and it is a Canadian spec locally delivered car.  The only
difference I know between a US spec car and a Canadian spec car are the
Canadian daylight running lights, spedometer/odometer in kilometers, and
the baby seat mounting points and hardware.  The car is slate gray with
linen interior.  It has 63,000 Km on it, and two previous owners. It is
straight and original, and appears to have been well cared for and kept
out of the salt and snow of Canadian winters.

I have subscribed to this site for some time now, and am impressed with
the knowledge available. Once our weather here turns warmer and I start
to work on the 928, I will most likely need some assistance.  I too have
a 'battery going flat after 2 weeks' problem, especially since the
weather is cold, but I think the car has the original battery, so I
might get off easy with a battery replacement.  Parts and accessories
for the 928 are sometimes hard to come by locally, but fortunately, my
wife visits San Jose many times a year on business, and DEVEK and
Automotion are between the SF airport and San Jose. I just bought her a
bay area map and a larger suitcase.

Look forward to your continuing help.
