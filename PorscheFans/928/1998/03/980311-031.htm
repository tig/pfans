Hi again fellow sharks!
And PT!
Yes the intake tubes are powder coated alpine white, as are the cam covers
(containers) and cam end caps and flanges behind the cam gears.  I paid $80
for the coating and it is super smooth and glossy, I need a full color crest
to re-apply to the center manifold: should look neat against the white!  The
reason for the blue tubing is economy: Mine were all splitting and ugly, but
at $35 each.... Ugh! Just could not do it.. So I got a 2' section of the
correct size (metric) dimensional super Everything resistant hose, and very
carefully cut 1.8" sections. Total outlay, hose and stainless clamps (also
metric) $32!!
BTW, if you want great cuts on large dia tube: slip a hose clamp over the
tube. get it where you want it, snug it up, measure again (they creep a bit)
and single edge razor blade around and around.. Walla! perfect cut! (see I can
be anal too)

***PT***
I have a freind with a digital studio mixing machine (portable) and I was
thinking about making some .wav's of full throttle, down shift bapping,
outside with car going away fast, and maybe even a open header sample... Would
that go on well your page?

Have a great night!!
