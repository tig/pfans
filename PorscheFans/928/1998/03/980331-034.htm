I went to look at a GT on Friday here in the UK at an official Porsche
centre. It is an M series car and yet was not registered by the UK importer
until 1993. The dealer want a 1993 price for it. The importer customer care
people tell me clearly that it is a 1991 car and that 1992 N series GT's
exist. They also tell me that the sticker is irreplaceable.

The sticker in the service book is missing but the dealer assures me that it
is not a replacement book and is as delivered with the car. The options are
written in the space where the sticker should be. The option sticker under
the rear carpet is all present and correct and the car is great but
expensive.

I might be tempted to hypothesise that the sticker might have the
manufacture date buried on it somewhere, and that the original importer
might have wanted to launder the car by registering it as late as possible,
then running it themselves for several months as a demo, then pushing it out
to their dealer channel. Please note I'm not alleging a sharp practice -
just one possible conclusion.

Would anyone on the list who knows the sticker intimately or whether a lot
of cars came into the UK in 1991 to sit in a field somewhere like to
comment..... I'd love to know how many of each series exist, by colour but
Porsche won't tell.

I'm not going to buy a car at full official dealer price without the sticker
in the back and in the book

I'd love your comments (by mail and I'll summarize if that helps)

Angus
P.S. I love this list. I read it all every day. No exceptions. I resolve to
post more - especially to UK people hanging out here.
