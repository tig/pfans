Stephane,

Its' hard to believe that someone would actually threaten you and your
family over a software glitch.  Criticism is one thing, but threats are
inexcusable. If its' true, there must be a way to track down the senders.
I'm not a hacker, so don't know the procedures involved, however, there are
laws against "Terroristic Threatening" its' a felony and carries severe
penalties.  In the short year that I've been part of this group I've seen
your many posts, instructive and helpful to lots of us.  Don't quit the
group because of this.

Try to find out who the people were who threatened you and I'm sure the
threat of prosecution will cause them in the words of the New York City
Police Dept, to make "massive adjustments to their attitudes".

Gene O'Rourke
