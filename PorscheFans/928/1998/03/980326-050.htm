ED,
I'd add some sort of tire temp gauge, it will be handy for setting
your pressures, and can give you some ideas on how your suspension
is working.
If you don't have a harness, the H clip mentioned before will be
mandatory. I used to clip mine as tight as possible then run the
power seat foward till I almost couldn't stand the pressure, it
still seemed loose when running.
 Make sure you fit in the car with your helmet on, if your over 6ft.
or long in the torso it will be real tight on headroom. My helmet is
always stuck against the roof!
This may go against what others think, but if my fluids were fresh,
I'd wait and change them after the track days, they are going to 
take lots of heat. Exception is the brake fluid, change it & take
equipment to bleed the system. I've had good luck with ATE Super Blue.
  If you can setup some sort of camcorder, or have someone film some of
your runs it may help the learning curve.
Good Luck.
DON"T CRASH!!!
DON'T MAKE ANYBODY ELSE CRASH!!!
