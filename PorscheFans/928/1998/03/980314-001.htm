Pretty certain.....unless Porsche was about 10 years ahead of the rest of the
auto industry in plastic molding, it's highly unlikely to be anything other
than a RIM processed part, as Injection molded parts technology has just very
recently ('95) been able to meet Federal crash standards......mostly due to
different / better resins available in the last few years. I saw a raw Porsche
bumper before and from a quick visual inspection, I was pretty certain it was
a RIM part.

RIM processes generally use a mixture of poly-isocyanate and polyol, which,
depending on the ratios and process parameters, can produce very different
part properties. Toyota's RIM bumpers have a wall thickness of aproximately
..125" 
and although they may seem flexible, it's surprising how tough and stiff the
material is, especially say in the size / configuration of the part you
describe. To illustrate the variances available in a RIM process, our soft
instrument panels are produced by this process, albeit the material is between
the vinyl skin and an injection molded substrate. (We make the skins,
substrates, and RIM completed part) Our bumper cores are also made by this
process and are different yet again.  
The bumpers for the Camry have always been RIM bumpers until the last major
model change, while the Avalon and the Sienna bumpers are injection molded.
Actually, Toyota was the first to develop the resin (TSOP) to make an
injection molded bumper a reality.....Take a look at the Avalon
Bumpers......my heart and soul went into those tools.......well actually a lot
of myself goes into every plastic interior part, including the instrument
panel, A,B,C pillars, consoles, headliners, etc., and the bumpers on the three
models we produce. I work in plastics engineering and pre-production trialing
of all major and minor model changes for our vehicles, and 
I don't mean to sound boastful of myself or Toyota, (or to degrade our beloved
Marque)  but Porsche could learn a thing or two about plastics from us.
(albeit, one of the few areas where they could learn something from another
manufacturer.)

Greg Schickel
