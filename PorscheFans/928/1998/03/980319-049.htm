<<Say, if they can  get 450hp out of the 911 engine why dont more people
try to get that much out of the 928 engines? I mean dotn they get like
800hp out of nascar engines?, you know it seems that 928 owners arent
like 911 owners,  I mean, you see 911 owner soupping up there car for
racing, and obviously theres the 911 twin turbo, and they do it with a
smaller engine.  There has been the recent talk about the vipers, and I
belive they have 400 and 450 hp so couldne we keep up if we had the
same?>>

Mike,
You are missing a huge piece of logic and info in your statement.  First
off, ever since the 911 was introduced Porsche has been trying to get
more and more power from it.  Constantly developing the car b/c it was
the car that always "went racing" for them.  It was also their best
selling model.  In comparison, the hp of the 928 went up (esp. from 87 -
96) in very small increments.  I can get the same hp out of my 87 S4
that the 95 GTS has with some minor exhaust and intake work.  Also,
sales of the 928 never were great in the US either, so it wasn't
financially feasible for Porsche to make infinitely faster 928's. 
Secondly, the 928 is meant for a totally different type of driving than
the 928.  The 928 is NOT (no flames please) a sports car.  It isn't
meant to be an all out 600 hp brute.  Third, you cannot compare the
engines of the 928, 911 and Viper.  They are all as different as night
and day to each other.  Sure the Viper has 400+ hp, but bore out the
engine in a 928 to 488 cu. inches and see what happens.  Or, a la the
911, slap a couple of turbos on a 928 and see how fast it is.  We, as
928 owners, could do all this, but is it financially feasible?  The 32
valve motor of the 928 is infinitely more complicted than the 911, but
also more refined.  In my opinion, 928's are way too expensive to make
*really* fast, and you ruin the "purpose" of the car in the process. 
But still, there are many people who go to Chevy-engined hybrids in
search of reliable hp.

Brian Buxton, with a slow (?) all Porsche powered 928.
