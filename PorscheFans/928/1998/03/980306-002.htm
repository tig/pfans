FWIW the electric pump in one of my work vans got progessively louder
and vibrated until it just quit.  Yup, stuck on the road and calling AAA
for a tow.

When the pump on the GT gave out, it did so without warning - although
maybe it did, I had the stereo up kinda' loud and was playing light to
light games on a bumpy section of the Embarcadero.  I led each time but
boy was I pissed when the car died and could not restrike.  Needed help
to push to side of the road, damn shark is heavy!

So...

Check your vent lines per earlier posts, or, I'd change the pump and
filter *now* if I were you, about $250 ought to do it + hour or so?
