Roger,

If you had read my post more closely you'd have seen that I mentioned all
three bridges plus the  high tension wires in Bournedale. I grew up by the
canal and used to watch Hellcats and Corsairs and Avengers and god knows
what else do the bridges almost on a daily basis. We had hundreds of planes
do it before us but we were probably the youngest that did it and it got us
booted out of the CAP, although they later reinstated us. 

As far as the 150 mph sex is concerned, you'll just have to use your
imagination.

Re: the Truro Radar Station.  When I was a kid I had a summer job driving
lumber trucks for the Grossman Lumber Company's yard in Sagamore.  I
delivered most of the lumber for the station.

A few years later my wife and I flew to Provincetown for lunch and on the
way back to Warwick, R.I. I decided to show her the Truro Radar Station. I
circled over it a couple of times at about 1000 feet and watched the array
of antennas following us. 

About two minutes later we spotted two specks rapidly growing larger in the
direction of Otis AFB, seconds later two F-94C Starfires crossed about two
hundred feet in front of us doing about five hundred knots.  I shoved the
wheel hard forward and managed to miss most of their wake, but we still got
bounced around quite heavily.  They made a huge sweeping turn to the left
and came back alongside us with their speed brakes out, gear and flaps
down, etc.  the only thing they didn't do to fly at our speed, was open
the canopies and stick their arms out. I'm sure their stall warning horns
were screaming in their headsets.  They motioned for me to follow them.
Yeah, right!  We were flying our first airplane, an Ercoupe, that cruised
at about 85 mph. I slowed down to about fifty, made a sharp descending
180", and landed at Chatham.  As you know, those old jets were'nt nearly as
maneuverable as modern fighters such as F-16s. It took them miles to turn,
so they lost us.  We then sat outside the coffee shop and watched them
trying to find us.  My wife thought it was loads of fun until I told her
that each of those planes had a ring of 24 rockets in the nose.  So much
for your and my ex employers.  Needless to say I gave the station a wide
berth thereafter.

Now as far as those ugly Vipers are concerned,  I hate to admit it but I
got smoked by one
when they first came out.  He blew by me on Rte. 1 between Aptos and Santa
Cruz until we hit the infamous Rte. 17 between Santa Cruz and Los Gatos,  I
never passed him, as he was slithering all over both lanes trying to take
the many curves over the mountains, but could have taken him there if he'd
stayed in one lane.
As soon as we got out of the hills and hit Rte 85 he was gone.  They're
fast, but they don't handle all that well. To each his own. I've driven
them a few times and they're fun for an hour or two but aren't all that
comfortable.  Basically $70,000 hot rods in my estimation. A truck engine?
As Mother Theresa would say, "You can't shine shit".

Gene
