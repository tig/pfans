No not what *you* are thinking and maybe I should've said
Blue Locktite is your friend, instead...

'Thrumming down from X mph today (gotta love those pipes) I
got shocked by an incredibly ugly sounding grinding noise,
shortly thereafter accompanied by some *wild* banging at the
floorboard!  So bad I thought I blew a rod but what the heck
the engine never missed a beat, and was running fine!  Ditto
on the trans as I gassed off and went to neutral - no
problemos!  

What in the hell?

Whatever it was, I dragged it along the highway for 2 miles
before the next gas exit.  Pulling into the station was even
worse grinding from under the car.  Yup, you guessed it -
the converter heat shield had lost the RF bolt.  I surmise
the speeds I was going was enough to make the shield into an
undercar airdam, forcing that puppy right into the ground. 
It bent and the changing air current as well as road
undulating made it flap wildy on the undercarriage - thus
the thumping noise.

Sheesh.  Once at home, took it off, banged it straight, a
bracket fell off and I had to drill and mount with nuts &
bolts.  Maybe I do need that portable welder.  For now I
used a length of coat hanger to tie it up in case the bolt
backs off again.  

Ideally I need:
- Locktite
- Safetywire 
- drilling jig for above

At least this didn't happen when we drove by the Porsche/VW
dealer in San Jose and I rev'd the engine up!

Get the nose up and check your bolts...
