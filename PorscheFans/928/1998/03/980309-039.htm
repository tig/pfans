	Years ago I wrecked an 87 Mitsubishi Starion that I only paid $5300 =
for. It had 110K on the clock when I bought it but was otherwise in =
excellent condition.
	During the pre-purchase negotiations, I took it to a friend of mine who =
was a licensed auto appraiser in the state of Massachusetts. He examined =
the car and advised me that I was getting a pretty good deal.
	I only had the car about six months before I had the accident and my =
Insurance company totaled the car offering me only $3300 for it.
	Well, considering that I still owed the bank $4400, this was no deal =
for me.

	So I went back to my friend and asked him to write me an appraisal for =
the car based on the value at the time he inspected it. He wrote an =
appraisal for me that indicated that his belief was that the car was =
worth more than the current blue book value. About $7000 in his opinion.

	Well, I used this appraisal as ammunition with the claims adjuster and =
we finally settled on a value of about $5700 for the car. After applying =
my $500 deductible, that left me with $5200. Subtract that from the =
payoff amount and as you can see, I made about $800 on the deal. Of =
course, this eight hundred didn't cover all the costs of owning and =
operating the vehicle for those six months, but at least I was able to =
pay the car off, and have a little money left over for my next car =
purchase.

	Not knowing what the insurance laws are like where you live, all I can =
suggest is "finding" some sort of documentation that supports your claim =
that the vehicle was worth more than what they are likely to offer you =
in settlement.
