Bob,
The bumpers are painted off the car and with a different type base coat and
top coat with flex additives.....this along with the different paint batches
makes it very difficult to have exact color matches.......especially on reds
and metallics.
We fight this problem constantly on the vehicles produced at the plant here in
Georgetown. (Camry, Avalon, Sienna)  
Looking closely at my car and others, I've noticed that many don't have an
exact color match either.
Also, this is a Polyurethane Reactive Injection Molded part, and is most
likely hand removed from the mold. If you look closely at the top right corner
of your right black bumperette, I bet it's got a small dent in it there. Most
all 87' and newer cars I've seen have this deformation, mine included. It
could be the result of a proud spot in the mold itself, but is most likely
caused by an over-zealous de-molder. Any area that is hard to de-mold (such as
the license plate area here) is subject to deforming while the part is still
hot, and becomes set-in when cooling. I'm sure they have a standardized de-
mold procedure, and this looks to be where when the part was taken off the
core half, always starting at the right side, pulling down until the license
plate area, where it is difficult to remove, and thru not being slow and
careful, the deformation was put in the part.
