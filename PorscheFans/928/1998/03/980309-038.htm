So I went back to do a more detailed inspection of it this weekend, and came
away with two things of note. First, it is in better condition than I thought
the first time I looked at it (I've since looked at a few others, from various
years.)  Second, some of the things on the various tags on the car are
interesting:


1. The color tag says:

            33X 9 3
    preussischblaumetallic
              S4

What does the "33X 9 3" part mean?  What's with the 'S4' part (as this is an
'84 928s?)

2. The listed GVWR is 4123 pounds!!!  Wow.  It doesn't *look* that big.  :-)
1985 front, 2205 rear. That's 47.4% front, 52.6% rear, which isn't what I was
expecting.

Please tell me this includes the passengers...


3. The rear deck options decal has lots of numbers, only some of which I
recognize, and two of which really puzzle me:

			###-####			DVT
SORT.NR.
FAHRG. NR.	WPOJBO 92 5 ES863049
CHASSYS NO.

TYP/TYPE			928   910

MOTORKB./GETR. KB.
ENG. CODE/TRANS CODE		M2820-81E		A2801-16E
LACKNR./INNENAUSST
PAINT NO./INTERIOR		L999			99

N?M? - AUSST./OPTIONS	C02	158	438	490	494
						533	650	S

I'm guessing that the last part of the Eng. Code "81E" indicates an '81' (s)
engine from model year E ('84) and that the A in the Trans. code is for the
automatic trans.  I'd guess that the 'M28' and 'A28' indicate model 928 codes,
but have no idea what the '20' in the engine code or the '01-16E' in the
transmission code mean.

The interesting part (I think) are the Paint No./Interior numbers, L999 and 99.
Are those real codes, or do they indicate custom?  The exterior is certainly
custom, as the preussischblaumetallic has silver along the edges and from the
rocker panels down (which makes this one look even more sharkish than most...)
 The option codes are all pretty clear from Phil's guide at 928s4vr.com, other
than the fact that this car has more of them than any other 928 I've looked at
so far.

Pictures will go up on the web when/if I buy it.  We should get the
pre-purchase mechanical inspection done this week if I'm lucky, next week if
I'm not.
