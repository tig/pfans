Help, 
during the melting of the huge snowfall I decided to look for vacumn
leaks.  My cruise control was not holding speed and based on the
suggestions in this list I started checking vacumn.  
Viola (what the heck does that mean anyway), I found the leaks.  The
first leak is in the vacumn distribution manifold for all of the various
flaps in the HVAC system. Its a rubber vacumn fitting with 5 Tee's and a
plug at the far end and the vacumn source comes in at the other end.  
 
The other leak, yes I continued to check and found another leak, is a
bad  vacumn valve.  Its the footwell flap vacumn valve.  Part # 906 210
062 2 ? I think.  
  
Are these 928 only parts or can I cross it over to another model.  Or
even, heaven forbid, an Audi or VW part.  My local dealer is 70 miles
away and does not carry anything for the 928 it seems.  I'd like to get
parts as soon as possible, nice weather is here again and the center
console is part way out, shifter knob off and little screws
everywhere?:(  
I'll be calling around tomorrow for the parts.  If anyone has
information on sources for these parts tomorrow during the day please
Email me at Ken.Postma@MCI.Com  
I'm impatient, what can I say.  It's probably one of the reasons I
bought a 928:o)

Both of these parts are buried deep under the center console:( 

Hey Jeff,

The archivbe search works well.  Can't wait untill is up with all of the
archives :).  But what will we do if we don't get to wade through 40 to
100 messages per day?

Ken Postma '86 928 S  (I'm betting the Cruise Control will work after
this but who                        cares, I want to "drive" it.)
