Not too long ago I had my 89 S4/5 Speed fixed (timing belt broke) by the 
local dealer.  Because the job allowed for the mounts to be replaced "as 
part of the job", they were replaced... my wallet is still feeling the 
pain from that "incident". Replacing the mounts made the car an entirely 
different experience, very smooth.

I will stop babbling. Before the unfortunate incident, my dealer was 
offering some advice on how to "diagnose" the unusual vibration/noise at 
1800-2200. They suggested (they could do it for me too) using a jack (or 
jacks) to lift the engine slightly from the frame. Doing this with bad 
mounts should eliminate the vibration. Like I said though, this was 
never done, since the engine had to come off...
