Howdy,
I completed the GTS Clutch Upgrade Saturday, and am very happy with the
results.
Firstly, I noticed that starting is much quieter and smoother due to the new /
lubed starter ring gear, and not having to drag a sloppy clutch assembly with
it's asscociated worn pilot and release bearings.
The clutch is easier to modulate, and the take-up is much better, with much
less chatter. The clutch pedal is also easier to push in; with shifting, and
more noticeably, downshifting, made smoother. (the time spent getting the
shift-cup and coupler bushings perfect undoubtably also helped this area) I
had previously had some occasional release bearing noise, and it too is now
gone. (old release bearing was pretty sloppy) ...... I suspect I also had some
noise from the pilot bearing as it was also sloppy, with the shaft coupler end
also being somewhat burnished looking. My clutch disc wasn't worn to the point
of replacement, (according to the manuals) but was showing the effects of 75k
miles, as were the blue spotted pressure plate and flywheel. (I'd obviously
gotten the clutch pretty hot at one point.....) I'd guess that part of the
reason shifting is better, is because the new pressure plate is disengaging
the clutch better. The old one had no slippage, but was most surely getting
weaker, especially in the clutch disengagement area. I'd say the  easier pedal
effort and smoother engagement are due to the new style release bearing, guide
tube, and release arm with new bushing......All-in-all, it was a big success,
and even though it was one of those "while I'm in there" jobs, it was due for
it and worth the effort. 
Thanks so much to Marc and Susan at Devek for all their help and patience! 
Also.....big thanks to Leonard Laub, and Angel Paredes for the informative
tips and advice!

Now a little bit about the job...... firstly, the manuals, although helpful,
leave a lot to be desired. They have no diagram of the single disk clutch
assembly, and assume a certain mechanical aptitude / resourcefulness,
especially in the assembling of the clutch assembly. 
The original starter gear ring had two dowel pins which a sensor in the top of
the bell-housing reads. The GTS style starter gear ring does not have the two
auxilliary timing dowel pins and they are not needed for the upgrade.
Apparently, per Marc Thomas, (I hope I'm explaining this right) the crank /
firing is already established and these are an auxiliary timing thing which
were subsequently deleted in '88~'89 anyway. 
Also, don't assume that the release bearing is configured ready for assembly,
as it likely isn't, and, even though lube is not supposed to be used on the
release bearing / guide tube sliding surfaces, I used a dry graphite spray on
these surfaces anyway.....(yet another, I think wise, recommendation from
Marc)

I don't know how much difference each made between the clutch job and new
oxygen sensor, but my car definitely runs much stronger, with a smoother,
quieter idle. 
A note about oxygen sensors......I couldn't find the post, but it was
mentioned previously, that if an oxygen sensor measures about .5 volts, it is
most likely working, and that it was impossible to measure the voltage cycling
due to oxygen content, without the use of an occsiloscope. (because it happens
pretty fast) It was also suggested to use propane as a fuel mixture richener.
Again, I tested my old one as per the manuals......and when idleing it read
between the given spec of .1~1 volt,
(aproximately .5 v) but voltage did not raise when given gas as the manuals
say it should. According to above, I should have assumed my sensor was ok,
since it was .5 volt, and I shouldn't have been able to measure the voltage
increase with a multimeter anyway. Well, not knowing any better, I assumed the
manual procedures were a proper way to check the sensor and I replaced mine
due to the results I got in those tests.       
Out of curiosity, after the clutch job, and before I replaced the fuse panel,
I decided to let my car warm up and test the new oxygen sensor. Yes, the
voltage was still correct when idleing, (as before) but the voltage DID
increase when gas was given and fell again when the gas was taken
away.......repeatably. 
This was done with a digital meter, as it shows in the manuals, and it is
testable without a scope. There are indeed items shown in the manuals that
require the use of a scope, (and it says which ones do) but the oxygen sensor
isn't one of them. 
On a side note, (and not so scientific) the old sensor did not seem to make
much difference whether plugged in or not, but the new one definitely makes a
difference when it's unplugged....idle not as smooth and off-idle acceleration
not as responsive.
It wasn't real noticeable that the idle wasn't as smooth as it could be when
the old sensor was in, but real noticeable when compared to the new one. To
wrap it up, the old sensor was bad and tested so, and the new sensor does make
a difference.

Also re-gapped the plugs and installed the new ignition components. (wires,
dist. caps, rotors) 
More flesh was lost on this than the clutch job! 
Car runs great.....now ready for the camshaft re-timing information gathering
thing....
Back to work tommorrow!.....Praise God!      
      
Apologies for the long post,
Regards to all,
