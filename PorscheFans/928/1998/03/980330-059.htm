Kevin,

There seems to be some discussion on this whether there is or is not a
gear shift selector position backlight.  I got curious and looked in the
shop manuals.  For MY '83 and '84 there are lights for gear selector
position at the gear shifter.  For the '83 its on page 97-183, the
wiring diagrams show 2 lights for 'selector lever illumination'.  This
is indicated for the automatic transmission only (of course).  For MY
'84 its on page 97-199 at ~B12, the wiring diagrams show option M249
(auto trans?) 'shift lever light'. Again 2 light bulbs. 
In MY '85, it appears that shift lever illumination went away and was
replaced by indicator lights in the tachometer.  The owners manual for
my MY'86 states on page 52, "The position of the gear shift lever lights
up in the tachometer display field whenever the vehicle lights or
ignition are switched on."   The tachometer has the 6k rpm indication at
about the 2 o'clock position with the gear selector position indicators
in the 3 to 5 o'clock area. 
This is the way mine works, owever I do also miss a backlight at the
shift lever.  Every once in awhile I look down there, my Jeep selector
is illuminated.  
I've looked fairly close at the wiring diagrams, but may have missed
something. Does anyone have an '86 where the indicators at the shifter
are backlit?

Hope this helps,
Ken Postma 1986 928S Indischrot (auto, lights in the dash not at
the                                  shifter)
