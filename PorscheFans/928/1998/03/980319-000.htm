       In response to Bill Bechtold's inquiry about roof racks, I would like
to suggest an Australian company named ROLA.   Many years ago I also was
sorting through the endless maze of roof racks.  Most looked like they would
be more at home on a truck than a 928, not to mention the wind noise they
generated, but I guess that wouldn't be of much concern to most truck owners
as their tires would generally drowned out the noise.  Anyway I happened to
see a car one day with this swoopy looking roof rack, and proceded to chase
him down to get the name.  Several years later, I was supprised to see I was
not the only one who thought these roof racks looked pretty neat, as Ford put
their version on the Taurus station wagon, and their still using them today.

Here are some tips on ordering:
  1.  Try and order direct from the factory if possible, as the dealers in
this country,
       (if there's any left), seem to be clueless about this foreign roof rack
system. 
   
   2.  Tell the factory to add about a 1/2"  more length to the cross bars,
mine are 
        a tad bit short in my opinion, but hey it may be there designed that
way as by 
        God they will stay on TIGHT well past 130mph, I can testify to that
personaly.

I have just checked ROLA's web site and they still list a rack system for
928's
their sight can be reached at:   WWW.ROLA.COM
 
P.S.   Now if anyone has one of the factory 928 trailer hitchs Porsche used to
sell,                
          I would really like to know about it, there is a picture of one on
the early
          79-80 928 parts microfilm but years ago my dealer said they were not
          available.
