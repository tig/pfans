Howdy y'all,

According to my Porsche owners guide the oil pressure should be at the 5 
bar when the motor RPM is 5000.   When I rev the engine that high it does 
not read higher than 2.5.  In fact thats where it always sits.  Is this an 
indication of a problem like oil starvation?

When the car is at idle there is an audible tapping sound from about the 
middle of the engine.  Not loud at all.  Could there a relationship with 
the sound and the oil pressure gauge reading?  The PO never said anything 
about it.   Hmmmm.

The temperature gauge always sits in the middle.  There is no ticking that 
would The engine has 96K miles on it and I guess it could be due for a 
rebuild.  As as recent owned of the car, I just wonder if the owners manual 
is correct.

BTW, I've only had the car a week and can't believe what a kick it is to 
drive it!
