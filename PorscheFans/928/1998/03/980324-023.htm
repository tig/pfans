Tom,
Based on my history with aircraft engines ( they ALL leak ) and
some British turd engines, my thoughts.
I would go for the factory gasket, lightly coated on both sides
with aviation Permetex ( the nasty black goo ). Clean both pan &
block with MEK or some other solvent & torque to spec. Personally
I'd use some LOW STRENGTH thread locker on the pan bolts. I suppose
you could drill and wire the bolts. This would look trick, but who
would see it? Another effective but unsightly method of holding
the bolts is to install them dry, then smear a bead of silicone
sealant over the heads. This looks like hell, but works well.
The downside to Permetex on the gasket, is that it's a real pain to
 get off later. Ask 3 people and get 3 different answers! Most ways
 will work but I've had real good results with the above.
