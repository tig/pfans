Mike,

I don't know if you've been on this list for a while, but there are some
sick puppies on this list (myself included). There are supercharged 928s,
twin turbos, custom bodied, gullwing-doored, etc. There is a company, DEVEK
PERFORMANCE, that does nothing else but make parts for high performance
928s. Take a look at http://www.fluidesign.com/928/yellow928.html to see my
car, and remember that is one of the milder modified 928s out there.

Also, don't forget the 928 was designed from the factory to do everything
well out of the box, so you can't make perfect better ;-)
