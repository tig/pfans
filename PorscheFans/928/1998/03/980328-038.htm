NA. As a rollbar is not something I plan on putting in at the
moment. (or in the future - not in THIS 928. Maybe the next one.)

Dunno. I don't think that qualifies as "reachable from driver's seat."

Ugh. Decidedly a blemish in my nice interior.  How about in place of
the rear A/C?  Not that I'd like to take a chain saw to the rear
console.

That's the only location that's leapt into my mind. Mount extinguisher
to floor in passenger side rear foot-well.

Actually, I've thought about it. That seems to be the system of choice
on the lotus list (being as there are two kinds of Loti - those that
have burned and those that will - not my quote btw...)

Quote from NER web page:

	Zone 1 Regions require a 2.5lb charge (minimum) class BC or
	ABC fire extinguisher at Driver Education Events. They must be
	held by a metal bracket (no plastic straps or brackets) and
	must be secured by at least 2 bolts and nuts. No sheet metal
	or self-tapping screws are allowed. It must be secured to a
	metal mounting point (chassis, seat rail, roll cage, etc.) and
	be reachable from the driver's seat. Some fire extinguishers
	come with plastic nozzles. These are unreliable and can break
	off easily. They are not recommended.


Given:

"It must be secured to a metal mounting point (chassis, seat rail,
roll cage, etc.)"

roll cage - no roll cage.

seat rail - huh? seat rail? As long as 2.5 lbs extinguishers are the size of pencils...

chassis - that's not the foot-well right?


I'm kind of stumped here.  I can't think of any place in the cabin
that's both accessible and near the chassis.  There isn't room between
the seat and the door sill.  I don't think the foot-well qualifies as
"chassis" but maybe I'm wrong.  I assume that by "chassis" they mean
part of load-bearing part of the frame which would include the door
sill, piller, sail plane etc. right?
