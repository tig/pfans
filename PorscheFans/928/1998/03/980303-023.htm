Lucky you!  I have since done a little research on your 928 Convertible.

I spoke with Jim Pascha (technical editor for "excellence" magazine),
Saturday.
He recognized the car and thought it may have been done by a firm in Costa
Mesa
or Santa Barbara who also did a number of 944 Cabriolet conversions for about
$16,000 each (plus donor car). His recollection was that a Mercedes mechanism
and bows were used as the basis for the top. He knew more about the 944
Cabs, though.

I also visited a firm who has done numerous 928 Cab and other conversions.
Conversion Techniques, 1309 66th Street, Emeryville, CA 94608, 510-654-9292. I

spoke with John who is also a 928 owner, and examined photos of about 20
different 928 Cab and other 928 conversions which they had done over the
years.
Unfortunately, your car was not one of theirs.  The black 928 Mega Cab
(last photo in the four I sent) was, however, one of their conversions. I saw
a
photo of it being loaded on a transporter for its trip to Florida.
 John was of the opinion was that this car may have been done by a firm in
Huntington Beach.  Unfortunately, he said they had numerous name changes and
were probably no longer in business.  If this were my car, I  would take it to
Vasek
Polak in Hermosa Beach, find the oldest mechanics and salespersons and ask
them
what they knew about it.  Vasek Polak was one of the first Porsche dealers in
the
country. BTW, Vasek Polak was where I bought my copy of "Project 928".  They
may still have a couple left.  I would also take the car to the Monterey
Historics
and PCA Parade this summer.  Someone may recognize it. I will be attending
both
events, and Phil Tong and several other members of the SF Bay Area 928 OC will

be joining me in Monterey.

On the issue of locating molding.  John uses primarily Porsche and Mercedes
parts
in his conversions to ease the difficulty of finding replacement parts or
making
repairs.  He suggested sources you may have already tried such as advertisers
in
Hemmings.  He and I agree that unless you get lucky on finding the maker of
your Cab, the best thing is to show the car to everyone in hopes that someone
will
recognize your molding and say - "Oh, that's from a 1980 XYZ."  For starters,
however, you can make a list of all convertibles and cabs made from say
1978-1985
and start looking at used cars. Chances are, one of the cars of that era
provided
the rubber pieces.  Your top cover appears to be Mercedes (look at a 380SL or
450SL).  If your top is padded, it may also be Mercedes and you should study
the various Mercedes roadsters.

Good luck in your restoration project!
