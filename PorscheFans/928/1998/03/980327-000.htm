<<Jacob, MSD, etc. all claim that they can improve performance, etc.  My
questions: Does it work? What are the gains? How much does it cost?
How hard is it to install?>>

Dave,

Sorry about the Lamborghini crack.  I apologize if I was too sarcastic.  As
for ignition systems, I have never tried MSD or Jacobs, and I agree with the
advice that the factory system is superior to anything you can buy
aftermarket.  But sometimes you can gain performance by upgrading the
wires/plugs.  

I put a set of Nology wires and Beru Silverstone plugs on a '90 Audi Quattro I
once had.  They too smoothed out the idle.  Unfortunately, I can't comment on
how much they improved performance because I also installed a TAP chip and a
cat-back exhaust at the same time.  Indeed, the car was much quicker in the
3000-7000 rpm range.  But again, I can't say how much of that was due to the
wires/plugs.

I also put the same combo (except plugs) on a '94 Grand Cherokee.  You'd think
I would learn about doing things incrementally so I could guage each upgrade's
effect, but like before, I also added a Mopar performance chip at the same
time.  Horsepower was not a problem for that car, but gas mileage was.  I am
happy to say that my mileage went up from about 12mpg to nearly 15mpg (figures
according to the computer in the car - and backed up by my own calculations).
I attribute this increase in mileage to the wires and plugs(in the Jeep I used
AC Delco RapidFire plugs), mainly because performance chips usually hurt
mileage rather than help it.

I think you can check out the Nology hardware online at www.nology.com (or
something like that).  Maybe someone else out there has tried them with
varying degrees of satisfaction?  In sum, these are the only modifications I
think are worth making to a factory ignition system and they don't cost severe
amounts of money.  They also don't void factory warranties, so that should
tell you the modification is considered minimal by the powers that be.

Good luck, Eric
.
