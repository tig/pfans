Hi all,

 Work is progressing. Finalized the "Search Page", it looks just
like the "Archive" page on the (PorscheFans) web site, but it
has options for list, number of months back to search, and
keywords to search for. Keywords are always OR'd.

 The script that tags archive files so that messages can be navigated
is complete as well. It may not be needed, but is useful to
me to create a more 'searchable' archive for testing.

 The actual script engine itself is nearly complete. It can take
search parameters and find messages with keywords from my 
private 928 archive. 

 The final piece of the prototype is the "Search Results" page,
which is formatted by the output of the search engine itself. 
I haven't decided whether I want to go to the effort of limiting
results to say 20 hits at a time, or just doing it all.

 There are two potential snags. First, if the list archives are
not separate files, or are compressed, then it will be harder since
the engine will have to manipulate lots of 'live' data. Second,
since the web page is maintained by a private concern, they may
be reluctant to spend any time (money) on integrating a new feature.
Maybe when I get there we could send a FEW emails asking about 
it!
