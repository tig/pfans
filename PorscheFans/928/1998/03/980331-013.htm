Jordan,

Re: your query on 928s vs Ferrari 456s,  I've driven a neighbor's 456 a few
times and I'd say that its about as fast as the 928 but has a more
ponderous feeling, which is understandable, as I think its around 4000 or
more pounds.  Doesn't feel as roomy to me, and doesn't have as much leg
room if you're tall.  If you don't need the back seat, a 550 Maranello
would be a better car, considerably faster, and about $30,000 cheaper.  I
don't know what the actual stats are, but those were my impressions.  A 355
coupe is also faster and better handling at roughly half the price.
