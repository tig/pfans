Greetings from a normally lurking 928 owner!  I have had the opportunity to
spend quite a bit of time recently trying to chase down an intermitant
performance lag...  I have a 90 S4 which sat for about 2 years without even
being started prior to my purchase last May.  I have had problems fuel
fouling the spark plugs which ever brand I tried, in a very short period of
time.(every 500 miles)  This has been an issue since I purchased the car.  I
never knew what I was going to get when I stepped on the gas under 40mph, a
ford escort, or the 928 supercar I have come to love.  Here is what I found:


Defective Mass Air Flow Sensor-tested by following the manual
Both Coils Weak-Tested with occilliscope one was corroded really bad 
Fuel injection relay-I tested by trial and error using a battery & a ohm
meter showing intermitant problems.

I replaced the above listed parts with an incredible increase in
performance.  My 928 has never run this great!  Just because your 928 starts
and runs good, doesn't mean the parts are working within specified
tolerances.  Slight operating differences in these parts can cause big
performance losses...  All parts age and can cause degregated performance.
Most people I see posting on this list want more performance.  Periodic
maintenace and testing can restore/maintain the performance the 928 was made
to produce.  I have also been trying to figure why these cars seem to be
underpowered electrically.  Specifically I have noticed the the cable from
the altenator to the battery is very long, at least 8 feet in length.  I
plan to replace this 4 gauge cable with a 4 gauge high flow cable, which can
be procured through your local car stereo outlets. This cable is heat & oil
resistant.   I noticed on my car there is a 1.2 volt drop between the
altenator & the battery. (Both end connectors are clean)  This is almost a
10% loss!  I was recently at a salvage and was able to cut this particular
cable on a wrecked car to see what the strand count was like.  Unfortunately
Porsche used some very cheap cable by today's standards!  You also have to
keep in mind that this cable is 8 years old.  Technology has increased the
performance on just plain old speaker wire and power cables as well in the
last 8 years.  I recently upgraded my headlamp bulbs to the 80watt low
beam/100watt high beam.  I ran a high flow 8 gauge power & ground to each
headlamp pod, and used two bosch relays using the factory wiring to trigger
these relays.  The power cables I connected via a 30 amp fuse to the
positive terminal on the passenger side of the engine bay.  The gounds I
connected to gound points already used  in front of the radiator.  The
result was Daylight on Demand!  Now if you stand in front of my car with
shorts on you can feel the heat from the lights 2 to 3 feet away from the
actual headlight, and that is the low beam.  I do not get flashed by
oncoming drivers.  I have not been pulled over by the local police, well,
not for my headlights anyway!  
I hope this helps anyone on this list.  Sorry for the length!
