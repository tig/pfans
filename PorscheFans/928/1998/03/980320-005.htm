After some 19 years of faithful service, I believe my radiator has gone to the
big scrap heap in the sky, as the plastic end cap has developed a split.
 
So here are the questions for anyone who might have an answer.

1. Is there any way to repair or replace this plastic cap? and would one want
to?
       
2. It seems the going price for a new radiator is $ 750.00, has anyone see a
better 
    price?

3. Perhaps even more important than the price, I understand there are better
radiators available than the factory units, and if this is the case who sells
such an item, and what does it cost?

Any information would greatly be appreciated.
