I have an 83 928s and am wondering what other porsche rims will fit and
what is the measurements,, 5 on 5 1/2 etc.  ??  If someone advertises that
their rims will fit on a volkswagen,, will they also fit on a porsche?? 
You have to admit that in 83 they may have been a nice style of rims, but
they didn't hold their stylish status quite as well as the car.  Thanks 
Jim stadter and Leonard Laub for the input on the fuel pump buzz from the
BUTT of my car.  I'll let you know the results after I get the car checked
out,, I have to have the timing belt done anyway. Does one of you live in
INDIANA by any chance?  I'm wondering if anything is going on around here
this summer.
Can anyone recommend good speakers for the doors of my 83, what size are
they anyway?  Does my car have an amp or does all the power come from the
stereo? I have a monterey deck. It works great but doesn't fully light up
at night,, (can't read the station).
Thanks
