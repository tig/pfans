I've owned the original Passport, the original Solo, and now a Solo 4.

I really liked the Passport and the original Solo, but hate the new Solo
4.

Things I don't like:

 - turns itself off with an annoying siren every 30 mins, unless you've
hit radar (the original one sensed motion, and turned itself off if the
unit was still for 20 mins)
 - falses on laser at all sorts of things, including LED displays
 - very insensitive compared to the original Passport (we had both in
the rally car this past two weeks)
 - stupid button arrangement--you can't tell power from
city/highway/mute etc. without looking at it
 - twice the size of the original Solo

Valentine One is Mike Valentine's new company, started after he left
Cincinnati Microwave (later renamed Escort).  In my opinion, it's gone
in the toilet since he left.  

THE ONLY REASON I own a Solo and not a Valentine One right now is that
it's cordless, and so I can put it in my motorcycle jacket pocket with
an earphone in my helmet when I'm on the bike.
