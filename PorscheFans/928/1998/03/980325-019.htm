These articles were in the October 1990 VW&Porsche mag (before they
switched their name to European Car)

"Herr Off - And Running"

"A West German motorist is believed to have sped into the British record
books after leaving police trailing in a 45 mile chase along A1(M) from
Catterick, North Yorkshire, to Dunston, on Tyneside, which took 16
minutes at an average speed of 168.75 mph.

High-powered patrol cars could not keep up with Randolph Off's Porsche
928 as they pursued him through three counties. A North Yorkshire police
driver set off in hot pursuit, but was forced to give up at 120 mph. A
County Durham police Jaguar took up the chase at speeds of up to 144
mph, but was also left standing.

Police finally caught up with Off when he was forced to slow down at
roadworks near Tyneside. Off, a insurance broker from Munich, was fined
800 pounds sterling by magistrates after he admitted reckless driving.

Mr. Kim Rainford, defense solicitor, said Off had switched his cruise
control to 70 mph, but when other drivers overtook him, he decided the
English were not strict about speed limits"

- David Graves, London Daily Telegraph"

There is also an article about Lamborghini developing a 2+2 to rival the
928. Did they ever do that?
