I am a new owner of an '89 928S4 with a few questions. I'll make this brief.

1) This vehicle has unknown mileage. The odometer reads only 900 miles, the PO
had 1800 miles on his title (also titled as incorrect mileage). All other
"brain" functions appear to operate properly (digital speed, MPG, est miles on
fuel capacity, etc). Any ideas on what causes an odometer to fail?

2) There are few records so I negotiated an allowance from the PO for water
pump/timing belt replacement. Are there any readily visible signs to indicate
that the timing belt or pump may have been previously replaced?

3) As to the discussion of proper armament when clearing log jams on I-95 with
a suitably modified 928, may I suggest high intensity directional laser. No
muss, no fuss, just vaporize anything in your path (be careful of bridge
abutments). Also, I believe it is imperative to share the experience of the
928's performance. With this in mind I recommend a weapons officer in the
passenger seat with full authority to site and fire on primary and secondary
targets, as well as targets of opportunity.

Happy Motoring
