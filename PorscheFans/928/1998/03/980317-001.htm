Greetings! I'm new to the list thanks to Moira Nash. I own an '83 
5-speed with 95k miles. I had the clutch and slave cylinder replaced 
at 88k and the clutch master cylinder at 93k. I bleed the system once 
a year to keep the crud out.  I've noticed over the last 5k miles 
that shifting can be a problem at times.  I've narrowed it down to 
this condition -- when the car is stopped or nearly to a stop on a 
grade with the nose higher than the tail, it's almost impossible to 
shift out of any gear. The car can be running or parked. Any thoughts 
out there? It kinda feels like the clutch is not disengaging all 
the way. Do I need new engine mounts or tranny mounts? The rebuilt 
tranny was installed at 77k by a very reputable shop.  I'm afraid I'm 
going to break the shift lever if this keeps up.

Second problem - Hatch.  The pin that the hatch shock attaches to has 
completely sheared off. How easy is it to repair this? Do I need to 
remove the rear glass? How do I access the pin that attaches to the 
body side? It wasn't visible when I removed the rear interior panel.

Thanks in advance.
