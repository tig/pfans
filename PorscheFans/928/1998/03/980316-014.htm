  The brake master cylinder and vacuum booster have to come out to gain
  access to the clutch master cylinder.  I put myself on the hook to write
  up instructions for removing and installing the brake mc and vacuum booster
  but haven't completed them yet (sorry Ken Martin!).  I promise to finish
  them as soon as I get a reasonable block of free time.
  
  The slave cylinder is inexpensive and looks easy to replace.  Since you're
  going to have to bleed the whole system anyway, I'd opt to replace the
  slave and know that the clutch system is good to go for quite a few years.

  I haven't, but the PO did.  I made a long lasting fix to a cracked air
  dam with a German made adhesive that was supplied with a Zender air dam
  that I put on my wife's car.  I can't recall the name of the product, but
  a Zender dealer could probably get some for you.
