You've got a much bigger problem....the detector-detectors that they
use.

I lost a Passport to one of those when I lived there.  If it's built-in,
all you're
doing is allowing the cops to tear down your car to find it, and they'll
be 
under no obligation to fix any damage they cause doing it.

If you've still got your heart set on doing this, buy another cheapo
detector,
and if you're pulled over, give up that one.  You'll still lose the
cheap detector,
and a $113 fine, but you won't have your car torn apart.
