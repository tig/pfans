928 fans,

Thanks to those who answered my last questions about rear thumping and =
tappets, on an S2.

I have just looked at a White 1989 S4 5spd Left Hand Drive.
It has been converted to look like a GTS, widened rear wheel arches, 17 =
GTS alloys with Goodyear F1s, looked pretty much like the Gold GTS on =
the front and back covers of the Performance Portfolio which I have =
always wished for, but without for the rear reflector. This car was for =
sale at 8,500 GBpounds (13,855 USdollars) Compared to the S2s I've been =
looking at recently, this seems to be a much better deal. It has done =
160K kilometres (100K miles).

An advantage with the S4 is that it uses, 95 RON I think the S2 had to =
have 98 RON.
in the UK 95 RON is 15% cheaper.

The wider GTS wheels were causing the tyre pressure sensors to be =
permanently on, the seller is received information from our Porsche main =
dealer on how to disable the sensors.

The engine wasn't as smooth as I would have hoped, I thought it could be =
misfiring, the seller says that He had just steam cleaned it, which =
might have been the reason, he has since had it serviced which seems to =
have cleared the problem.

I have had am independent inspection on the car which has shown up, =
light front and rear damage repair. Bonnet doesn't line up and towing =
eye hole doesn't line up with bumper cover, the respraying hasn't been =
done to a very high standard, but if I can get the seller to adjust the =
price I think I'll go for it.

This car has just been imported from Germany, It has a catalytic =
converter which was not a requirement in the UK, the inspection showed =
that the ceramic catalyst is breaking up.
The recommendation is to throw away the cat and fit a mid section =
silencer instead, which will require some modifications to the engine =
management sensors. Does anyone know the procedure for this?

I wouldn't normally choose a white car, is White an OK color for a 928, =
will it be easy enough to sell again?

Someone else is interested in the car and is planning to get it =
inspected on Saturday, so if I can make a quick decision then I'll get =
the car.

Nigel.
