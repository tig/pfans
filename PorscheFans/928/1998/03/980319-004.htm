George,
Get it at the Porsche Dealer, ask for a PCA discount (you are a member,
right?). It should be around $100. Seems high, but comes with 2-year
replacement warranty. I have had mine go bad twice so far in my 89 S4
(actually my fault from non use of car and too many repeated charges from
leaving doors open while detailing etc.). I just walk in with my invoice
from almost 2  years ago (22 months last time) and they hand me a new one,
no questions asked.!

Plus an added bonus, it is always impressive to me (and many others) when
inspecting a 928 to see that white battery with the big "PORSCHE" on the
side of it. It is a good indicator to me that the owner will spend the extra
few dollars to use genuine Porsche parts.  Of course, everyone knows how I
am about stuff like that.
