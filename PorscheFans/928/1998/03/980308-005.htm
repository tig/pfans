I find the current commentaries about the "correct" pronunciation to be
humorous.  Annoying, but humorous.

It was in the fifties that I first learned what a Porsche was.  It was just
about the time that my mother bought her first VW bug,a nd the dealer that
she bought it from was a Porsche/VW dealer.  (Imagine the concept!  VW and
Porsche under one roof!)

Anyway, in the interim, I have met many Germans, both those involved in the
auto business and not, and in addition have studied German fairly
extensively in college.

FWIW, it seems that the ONLY correct way to pronounce the name is the way
that the current senior member of the Porsche family would pronounce it.
And I don't think that Ferry Porsche is interested in going around
correcting his customers' use of his name. I suspect that HIS interest is
primarily that the name is SPELLED correctly on the check!

From my experience, I have heard the name "correctly" pronounced several
ways, depending upon the German with whom you are speaking.  A Swabian will
pronounce it differently than a Hanoverian, or a Berliner, etc, etc, etc.
It's much the same concept as saying that people from the Far Western US and
the Mid-west US don't speak English nearly as well as those of us from New
England; those poor souls from New York/New Jersey and the Deep South don't
speak English at all....even the Brits have largely given up on the
language, but that is a post for another time. (The Aussies NEVER HAD it at
all!)

I have heard Porsche come off German tongues as:  Porshuh, with no emphasis
on the "uh";
"Porschay";   "Por-shE"; and even the dreaded "Porch".

Now, while you hoons are racing around trying to phrase commentary on the
correct pronunciation,a nd from whence it came, I am going to go out and
drive my 928.
