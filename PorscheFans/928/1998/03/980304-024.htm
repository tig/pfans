If the unit is not powered up, it cannot be easily
detected. Hide a switch under the pod that simply
cuts the power to the detector.

As far as the scale-of-simplicity, if you're "going in"
then you going in with a mission to accomplish sans
failure. Hiding a detector behind the seatbelt warning
panel will be nontrivial. The area behind the seat belt 
warning light is tight. Take off both carpeted console
side panels. Right away you'll notice that the area under
the console is stuffed. The fiber optics for the temperature 
controls dangle down in there. The stereo is in the way.
The clock is in the way. The ashtray is in the way. There
_might_ be a noise supressor in the way (for the stereo).
Take some preliminary measurements or even try to stuff 
the detector up in there to see if this is even feasible 
to begin with.

Let's go on as if it's feasible. You're going to mount the
detector to _something_. What? The warning panel itself?
Or maybe the side/s of the console? Drilling and bolting?
No...probably epoxy holding angle brackets because visible
bolts would look substandard. Are you good with plastic 
panel fabrications? You _should_ just get another seatbelt 
warning panel of the same vintage and start from there. 
Remove the warning light. Line up the detector's warning 
lights. There may be a need to grind off some of the plastic 
in the backside of the project panel (are there tabs or 
extrusions in the way? probably).

Measure and glue a couple of angle brackets to the backside 
of the warning panel that will work to support the detector. 

Before trying to get your falsy in place, disconnect your 
battery first (duh). You'll have to pull the stereo. Your 
clock will probably be in the way as well. Pull the ash-tray 
too.

Remove the original panel, leave it connected and stuff 
it back behind the radio. Why? Because you CWL and IL may
be stuck on if a break in the seatbelt warning system is
detected. Install your new, detector-loaded panel. Hook up
the power supply through a hidden, serial, mini single
pole single throw (SPST) switch that is mounted through
a hole drilled through the bottom lip of the dash pod. Do
you know where to get +12v? Do you have the Workshop Manuals?

Hey! If I can stuff a Chevy small block into my car, then I
can figure out the simple task of how to hide a radar detector.
