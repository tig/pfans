Hi,
My '88 doesn't have Magic Blower Syndrome, but my understanding is that
once the topic is raised here, at least one car will suddenly
be affected.  We've all been warned.

In the case where the fan goes full on: There is probably a
switch which is controlled by the vent selector slider.  When
the slider is on defrost, the fan goes full on no matter what
the fan speed setting, this is a feature.  How close in proximity
is the defrost contact to the select contact on the switch?  If these
parts are housed within the climate ventilation, is there a chance
that maybe some condensation is forming on contacts and closing
the circuits?  

This happened to one of those firetruck toys
our kids had.  Woke up early early in the morning to the sound
of sirens and what seemed to be some idiot's car alarm.  Went on
for hours.  Went down to check it out, it was coming from our yard,
and, it was coming from this ride'em firetruck, but there were no
kid pushing the siren button. Upon inspection, a drop of water had 
collected on the siren contact tab and it kept the circuit closed 
until just before I threw the whole rig at a tree.  This carefully
calculated measure was needed to ensure that the circuit remained open.
