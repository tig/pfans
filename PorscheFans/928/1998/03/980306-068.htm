Sold the beater pickup truck and bought a jeep Wrangler. The day I went
to pick up my truck from the mechanic (having some work done on it I
didn't bother to do until I decided to sell it) the power steering
failed on my 928. Fluid reservoir is empty - when i crank the wheel
around it squirts fluid straight down out of some unseen place on the
drivers side. I left it at the shop where they did the work on my truck,
so I can use their lift and see where its coming from. Being optimistic
helps, considering the price of racks and my new car payments.
Did anyone ever answer that question about the stress levels of the
steering components? Its a BEAR to turn but the workout is useful - and
I would get used to it on short order. But can the steering shaft &
other components handle the strain?


BTW - Whos the other fella with the wrangler? I'd like to have a private
chat about some of the niftiness about having a 928 and a lifted up off
road toy.
