Mike,
As far as lubing the release bearing itself, that wouldn't be possible either
in or out of the car unless you disassembled the bearing itself. (I would
assume if you've got release bearing noise and it goes away when you push the
clutch in, that the bearing itself is on it's way out......but it'll last a
long, long time before it fails.) I had occasional release bearing noise for
probably 40k miles, but it never got worse or any noisier. 
However, you could lube the release bearing / release fork contact area, the
release bearing washer / pressure plate fingers contact area, the guide tube
O.D. / release bearing I.D. contact areas while in the car. Actually there
wouldn't be much danger of getting any lube on the clutch disk surfaces as
it's sandwiched by the pressure plate and flywheel and is virtually
inaccessable. I'd suggest a dry graphite spray lubricant at the point where
the release bearing washer contacts the pressure plate (this area isn't
commonly lubed on a clutch job, but can be a source of noise and was
definitely a high wear area on my old parts.) You could also use a small brush
and lube to do it and also the above mentioned areas. Just don't get
overzealous to the point of the lube possibly being slung onto the clutch
surface during operation. As far as longevity, I'm sure it'd last fine, but
again your noise is most likely the bearing itself.
It'd be easy enough to do the above mentioned stuff......couldn't hurt.....may
help. 
This can all be done by removing only the lower clutch cover.

The updated release bearing itself is $200.00, but must be used with the
updated guide tube ($33.00) and release fork. ($75.00) ..... (If your clutch
and pressure plate are fine,  this would be a less expensive option.)
All told, the complete GTS Upgrade is about $900.00 to do it yourself.

Manuals say 60k mile replacement interval. The job is not too dificult at all.
Some say you have to drop the exhaust but on mine (and I'd say yours) it's not
necessary. ( I had the exhaust removed for the clutch job anyway, but I had
checked it before and was able to take it out without any exhaust removal) 
The part was $119.00 from Vertex. (It was an OEM Bosch)
