Here comes the potential 'bad news'.  Since the seat is
twisting, I would gather the motor is fine.  What's probably
happening is the seat tracks are bent.  You need to undo the
seat from the car and see if the rails can slide easily back
and forth (ball bearings in there).  They should, just like
a nice rifle slide.  Any binding spells trouble but luckily
there's quite a few places to get tracks.  

Porsche put one hell of a seat motor in there and it will
try in vain to do what you want - DON'T BURN IT OUT!

My car had the same problem, binding only at the front most
position...

Good luck!
