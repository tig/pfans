Michael,

Vis-a-vis your comments on my flying derring do.  To begin with, that was
most likely before you were born.  Secondly, in about a million  and a
quarter miles of driving all over the world in everything from mopeds to 60
ton battle tanks, and several thousand hours of flying everything from hang
gliders to double sonic military jets, I've never had an accident or
engangered anyone's life.  In the past five years since some parking lot
attendant acquired my radar detector, I haven't bothered to replace it and
have driven roughly 125,000 miles without being stopped, including several
round trips from Palm Beach to Santa Cruz in three days each.  I pay the
lowest possible insurance rate on my 928 and other cars.  

If thats the profile of a reckless driver I plead guilty.  And as far as
you once committing such a dangerous act as driving your 928  145 mph is
concerned,  You are obviously a wild and crazy guy. Thats not a helluva a
lot different from driving  through Miami on a Saturday night, where, as
Dave Barry says: "Its' considered legal to drive through red lights if you
can still remember when they were green" and " Never blow your horn at
anyone because they may become confused and start shooting". 

Maybe you and Bill Crosby should start a Formula one racing team.  Boy!
I'll bet that would scare the hell out of Jacques Villeneuve and Michael
Schumacher.  Michael don't take life so seriously because you're not going
to get out of it alive no matter how cautiously you drive.

Pax

Gene O'Rourke
