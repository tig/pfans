Hello P-Fans & Clark

The design target for the 928 project was suppose to be a 5.0L engine with
a 300 Hp. Porsche latter feared that would make the car too close for
comfort in the 911 performance area!!! So Porsche de-tuned the motor to
4.5L with 219 Hp. It was not until the sales of the 928 slowed down, did
Porsche give the OK for a larger displacement/higher output Hp for the 928.
It wasn't until 88 M.Y. for the USA, that Porsche met the 300 Hp goal,
actually 316 Hp for the 88 928 S4 models. And to think that Porsche had a
300 Hp 928 engine back in the early 80s making that kind of power! No
wonder they did not want to upset any 911 with a faster model than the
beloved 911 !!!


A Side Note:  The 85 euro 928S had a 4.7L, 300 Hp engine while the US
models made do with 240 Hp motor! No wonder the gray market cars flourished
here in the US market at that time!
