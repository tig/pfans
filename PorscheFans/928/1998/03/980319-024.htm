FYI:

There were some questions on the list earlier about powder coating brake
parts. Someone mentioned they just used regular high temp paint. I've
done this, and it worked well, but I noted that the new Automotion
catalog I received yesterday has kits specifically designed for this
which contain a cleaning solution and a special lacquer paint.

Also, I saw an episode of Hot Rod Magazine on TV that briefly showed a
home powder coating system. It may well be the same or similar to the
one referred to by William. Looked pretty easy, it came with a spray gun
which required roughly 8 lb. air pressure. The down side is that, after
you've baked the parts in your oven at 400°, you can't use the oven for
food preparation anymore - if you do, you may have to break out the big
Henkels to get through the glazed ham...
