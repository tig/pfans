Subject: So what's with this dual-syllable "Porsche" thing?

Just kidding, I knew the name is pronounced with two syllables.

But I've considered the single-syllable pronunciation "porsche" simply a
nickname for the dual-syllable "Porsche".  Like a "beemer" (or is it
written "bimmer"?) would nickname a BMW, a "vee-dub" a Volkswagen,
etc...

Just out of curiosity, could someone opposed to the single-syllable
"porsche" give me your rationale on why you don't appreciate hearing it? 
I'd like to understand this aspect of proper-Porsche-ownerdom a little
bit
more.  Thanks.

	Would you call your "country" a "cunt"?

	In German, words which end in a "e" are pronounced with an "a" sound. 
The reason people get upset is that is shows either ignorance or
indifferance about something they enjoy and care about.  

	If you know that it is a 2 syllable word, then show a minimal level of
education and pronounce it correctly.  The extra effort won't kill you.
