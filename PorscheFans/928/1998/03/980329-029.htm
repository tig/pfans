Hi All,
        I have put a deposit on a 93 928 GTS the car is a one owner,
Black on Black with 87,000 kms and has all books and records. The only
negatives are the car does need a new windshield (cracked from a rock
flying from a lawn mower) and there is a scratch in the left front. The
price is right at 32,000 US but this mean's I will have to sell my 88s4
so here's the deal and the bio.

1988 928 S4 White on Blue I am the 2nd owner the first owner wasn't big
on keeping records but the service place he took the car to be fixed was
a authorized Lamborghini dealer but they went bankrupt and all of there
records are gone. The place did open under a different name and I talked
to the owner/service guy and he remembered the first owner because he
had a 911 turbo  and in his words "spent a shit load of money here and
always did what needed to be done". I have bills too show what I have
done- Water Pump (NEW NOT RE-BUILT), T-belt (REBUILT-just kidding),
Steering Rack (rebuilt from Porsche) and the tire's are new (Yokohama
AVS-S4's) the car has 135,000 kms on it and the price is 24,000 Canadian
or 16,999 US. to bring a Canadian car to the US there is a 2.5% duty and
you have to get it DOT certified (about 500$) plus state taxes. The car
is in Kilometers!!!!!! E-Mail If interested.
