         Subject:  Re: Question on belt
 
Kevin,
I've heard different stories about when to change the T belt. 60K is
what I've heard recommended the first time, but then I've heard between
30K and 45K after that. Why the difference after the first time I don't
know. I'd be interested in hearing what others say about the belt
schedule. 

But, since the friend I bought the car from only had it a year before
selling it to me, I didn't have any way to confirm when it had been
changed last. So I guess it was a case of better safe than sorry. Also,
my friend has an interest in a repair shop where they do very good
work      on 928s, so I got it changed at his cost (if I had waited I
would have got to pay retail).

I can' t fault your reasons, nobody ever suffered from being too
cautious. Anyway, my information from manuals and shops is that the
rating is 65k every time, but that what really is important and
frequently overlooked is  the 10k mile tensioning adjustment.  This is
particularly important if you
tend to punch it and risk spinning the belt.


Kevin,
 
Listen there are certainly things I would rather spend money on than
belts, so I appreciate your input on the subject. Now I had heard that
the interval on belt tensioning was 15K, you say 10K-- this is
maddening. Oh well, I'm beginning to think we should keep all this to
ourselves; if this got to the list we could have another battery or oil
additive situation.
