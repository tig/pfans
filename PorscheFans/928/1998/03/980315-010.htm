 As a recent new owner of a 1985 928S(auto, ruby red metallic)  I
     would like to add one wax  to the list for consideration or
     comment as we approach  spring .  Meguiar's  has a Gold Class
     clear coat liquid or paste wax which they say is the most
     reflective in their 95+ year history.   Not a pure wax, it deepens
     the color, creates super sharp reflections,  cleans the surface,
     removes swirl marks,  adds polishing oils, reduces UV ray damage
     and adds polymer prrotection  ( 5 months + ) .  I believe it can be

     used on non clear coats also.

     I get my car serviced at Holbert's and one  late afternoon when  I
     got into the car a salesman came over and asked if I just got it
     painted.  I smiled and said it is the original paint and  I told
him
     the brand of  wax I used and he mentioned he would pass it on.
     They do use a Carnauba wax which  they buy in bulk.  On that day,
     3 weeks after waxing , if I could  have driven it into the show
room
     it would have probably out shown any of  new  cars if you like a
     super reflective,  vivid color shine.

     It is available at Pep Boys  for  10 dollars .
