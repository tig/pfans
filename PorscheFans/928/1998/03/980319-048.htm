don't you ever get in trouble?  I mean how do you not get stopped by the
cops

Mike,
I've posted to the list with a story such as this before, and I have to
admit that I average about 1 ticket per year and maybe 1 warning.  I am
now in my post graduate level in defensive driving.  I usually am not
*stupid* about where I do my racing, though (ie. in the middle of
town).  The highway or by-pass are usually my choice for showing the
"lesser cars" what the rear of my Porsche's look like.		=)

Honestly, I don't really race in my 928 very often.  I see it as making
the car do something it wasn't designed to do (0-60 sprints ~ no flames
please).  The last time I raced in the 928 was a couple of years ago. 
Consisted of a 0 - 95mph sprint against a 93 Mustang Cobra with heavy
mods, including a supercharger.  We were dead even the entire time.  And
those 93 Cobras are fast cars - owned one for a year.  Not bad for a 12
year old car with an automatic though!  If you *really* want some good
racing stories you'll have to join the 911 list though.  I don't want to
get flamed by talking about my 930 too much!!		=)
