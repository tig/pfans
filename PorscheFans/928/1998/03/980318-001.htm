Kevin,

Hard to say, but could be something as simple as needing an adjustment 
of the control pressure.  I think that you really need to get this one 
checked out by a GOOD place with experience with these 
cars/transmissions AND the proper pressure testing equipment.  Maybe 
your local Porsche dealer, or better yet Mercedes dealer. (?)

Can't help you there, I'm in VA

It is a full blown Mercedes-Benz transmission, and says so all over it.  
They probably know more about it than Porsche.  ;-)
