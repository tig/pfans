Kinda tough on Porsche, aren't you?

Why make such a firm statement?  I've had Sears and Interstate (relative
owned farm store is an Interstate dealer) as well as many, many others
over the years and forced to return many.

  Let's see.......we've threaded ad nauseum about:
oil                                     oil filters
dino oil                            synthetic oil
oil change interval         water-wetter
trans oil (see above)     lug nut material
torques                          wheels/offset
tires                                 shocks
spark plugs                    plug wires
that 2mm screw hidden under the LH cowl behind the
combobulator...........

Guess it's time for batteries!?

IMHO, batteries fall into that category directly proportional to
experience.   My experience over the years convinced me that quality is
generally high, and to defend (as you've done) one brand over another is
futile.   I have a good load tester and electrolyte tester - and
returned many Sears Die-Hards that failed within two years.

I generally buy Sears, cuz there is an outlet very close to home making
purchases (or exchanges) convenient.   The biggest factor is USING the
battery.   Lead-acids like to have current flowing at regular intervals
to keep them in top shape.

You missed Dave's point.   We have a very high-quality, high-performance
machine with a world-class name badge.   What's wrong with spending an
extra $50 on a critical component to keep the car 'as delivered'?   I'll
consider for my car when the time comes.   As Dave said, it DOES make a
diff to see that even the battery is Porsche pedigree, to me and many
others.

Quick story:   Last year I purchased a new battery (no....not for the
928) at Pep Boys which lasted one month.  Replaced for free, and
replacement went dead in two weeks.   Upon return, I required we put the
second replacement on their tester (the one the store keeps by the
battery section to test customer's used battery).   The next THREE off
their shelf all tested bad!  We found the date code of manufacture and
looked for one produced on a different day.......oila!    I got a good
battery, but will probably stay away from Pep Boys for batteries.    I'm
not mad at Pep Boys......  ***t happens.

Sorry for the long post, but Sunday lists are usually short anyway!
As with most of the issues in this category, YMMV.
