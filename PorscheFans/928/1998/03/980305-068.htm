Hey Guys, I finally got my new webpage going. Here's the address:
http://www.eatel.net/~dslabat/928.htm
It's only about 25% complete, but I wanted to get it out there for 2
reasons.
1) I need some info/feedback from you guys. As you all know we have a
couple of great 928 sites out there already, with tons of info, faqs,
classifieds, and even a registry. So, besides having the mandatory
photos, links, etc., I am going to try and fill some voids. This is
where you guys come in! I want to have a page that list mechanics/shops
that specialize in 928's. It seems to be a popular question on this list
and if I can compile a list of them in one place, it would be a great
reference! So please e-mail me with the Business name and/or Mechanic's
name, address (including, city/state/country), phone #, and e-mail if
they have one. Please try and keep it to mechanics that really know our
cars. The guy I use is both a friend and a Porsche nut! He just got
another 911 ('97 C2), still has his '80 SC w/32k miles, and could
probably rebuild an air-cooled six in his sleep!. But, he won't be on
the list because he knows nothing about a 928!!! So who knows, I might
even find a new mechanic :-)

2) I play around with computer graphics (nothing intense), and have
another site dedicated to strictly that medium. But, when I got my '85S
last year, I started toying with some graphics related to the 928 and
Porsche, in general. So, instead of posting the usual assortment of 928
photos, I'll be creating some 928/Porsche pics of my own for your
enjoyment (I hope).
The first one I did is posted on Phil's site (on the "modifications"
page), and I had several inquiries/feedback about putting it onto a
T-shirt. So, that's exactly what I've done. So if you'd like to see it
and pick one up for yourself, just go to my website and click on
"t-shirts". I think you'll get a kick out of it. I'm only going to make
a limited run of these (I have a friend in the business), so you better
grab 'em while they're hot :-)

Have more, but this is getting long :-(
