And you are correct that Turtle Wax Bug and Tar remover does have
petroleum distillates in it, but take a look at 99% of waxes and
polishes out there.  Almost all do! (Everyone check your wax products
ingredients and write back to let us know which ones do and don't have
petroleum distillates in them.)  Which is why I use Zymol.  Completely
pure and natural.  And it gives the best protection and shine I've
experienced.

All carnauba waxes (including Zymol) contain petroleum distillates. 
Pure carnauba is as hard as a brick.  That's why the P21S wax ads and
Griot's Garage make fun of Zymol for advertising "pure carnauba". 
Natural carnauba is white, yellow or brown, not Zymol blue.  

There are hundreds of types of petroleum distillates.  Paraffin wax,
women's face cream, and gasoline are three.  It's how reactive the end
product is that determines it's degree of solvency on your paint.

Incidentally, Larry recommends One Grand Tar Remover for tar, P21S
Citris for bugs.
