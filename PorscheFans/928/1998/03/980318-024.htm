   Lately i have heard alot about you guys racing other cars, and well....
don't you ever get in trouble? I mean  how do you not get stopped by the cops
and aren't you afraid of being stopped by the cops?    Also  well you say you
got beat spanked etc. could you be more spacific like "hew was 100ft in front
of me" or "I was on his tail but couldnt pass him" or  "we were side by side
and he was ahead by a nose but I could never pass him" ETC. And  could you guy
tell us of some wins, with car that are worthy of competition, no hondas, or
camaros pleas.
 Also what guys usualy try to race you, or give you looks or try to intimidate
you etc.?
