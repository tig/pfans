Steve (and everybody),

Here's some stuff about the torque tube.  I'll write about the shocks in 
a separate post since this is so long (sorry).

I learned a lot about the torque tube while doing my project. here's 
what I discovered:

The tube for the automatic only has two bearings in it, as compared with 
the manual trans. tube which is longer and has three.  The two bearings 
in the auto's tube are also larger in outside diameter and larger in 
inside diameter than the manual tube's bearings.  The drive shaft itself 
is shorter and thicker in the automatic than in the manual.  Hence, the 
bearings are not interchangeable.

Each bearing is pressed into a "carrier" which is a metal piece with a 
thick rubber ring aroung the outside, which is then pressed into the 
tube.  The drive shaft is press fit down the center (there's a rubber 
ring in the I.D. of the bearings).

When I removed my torque tube from the car, I noticed that the drive 
shaft wobbled a little in the front bearing. It wasn't a tight fit.  So, 
I decided to try and replace it.  NO parts for this are available from 
Porsche, you're supposed to replace the whole thing, and it's VERY 
expensive (so, what else is new!).  The next option is a re-built unit.  
Both Devek and 928 International rebuild these, they go for around $500 
or so.  I figured, "Hey, a damn $20 bearing is all I need!  I just have 
to figure out how to R/R it."

Here are some of the problems I had to deal with:

1)  Getting the driveshaft out.  This turned out to be pretty easy.  I 
used a small, short-handled sledge hammer (with a block of wood so I 
didn't "mushroom" the end of the shaft), greased the shaft (at least the 
little bit I could reach), and just beat it out.  Since the front 
bearing was loose on the shaft anyway, I only had to clear the back one.

2)  Getting the bearings out.  I used a piece of threaded rod to make a 
"puller".  I cut a piece of rectangular steel, a little smaller than the 
width of the I.D. of the bearing, and a bit longer, with an elongated 
hole in the middle.  I slipped this over the end of the rod, then 
attached a nut.  I was then able to slide the plate through the I.D. of 
the bearing by flipping it back almost parallel with the threaded rod 
(that's why I made the slot), and once through, flip it back down 
perpendicular on the other side of the bearing.  This gave me something 
to pull against (don't let go of it though, as you won't be able to get 
it back out at this point!).  I put the other end of the threaded rod 
through an old pulley I had laying around that was larger than the end 
diameter of the torque tube - to anchor the other end.  I also greased 
the inside of the tube so that once the thing got moving in there, it 
would slide easier.  As I tightened the nut on the pulley end, it pulled 
the bearing out.  It's in there pretty tight; it bent my piece of steel 
(use a strong piece).  Hopefully, the bearing and carrier will come out 
together.  Mine did.  If not, then you have to get the carrier out.

3)  The bearings.  Mine said "FAG 6007 C5" on it.  I called a couple of 
local bearing houses (yellow pages) and found out that "FAG" is the 
manufacturer, "6007" is the bearing number, and "C5" is the internal 
tolerance.  It's also shielded, which means a metal cover on each side 
as opposed to a rubber seal.

Ok, order me one (please).  BZZZZZZZZZT!  No can do.  "C5" is a RARE 
tolerance, very loose, to take a lot of heat.  "C3" is the best they can 
do.  Ok, call another place, start over.  What's it for?  Porsche 928 
torque tube...  well, it turns out that this guy has a 944 so he's a 
little more helpful.  We talk Porsches while he's checking stuff, and 
eventually he has to call me back.  He eventually says, "Even as an FAG 
distributor, this bearing is unavailable to me.  They probably have an 
agreement with Porsche.  Manufacturers do this to lock up the market, 
they want you to buy the whole assembly."  Hmmmmmm....

Well, then I think, maybe the C3 tolerance is "good enough"; after all, 
Porsche OVER-engineers everything right?  While we're debating this I 
mention that there's a rubber collar inside, which I think is worn, 
because my shaft is not tight in there.  He says that the new bearings 
WOULD NOT come with any rubber collar.  So, that doesn't help me either.  

Knowing that both 928 International and Devek rebuild these things, I 
thought I'd check with Mark Anderson and find out where they got the 
bearings from.  Well he was quite honest and said that he didn't know 
anything about any C5 or C3 tolerance, they just got them from the local 
bearing house.  He said they've been using these in the race cars and 
never had a failure.  He was willing to sell me some, and he told me the 
number was 6006 (presumably that's the smaller one for the manual cars, 
I needed 6007 I think) if I wanted to get them locally.  The catch was, 
there was NO RUBBER INSERT.  They re-use good ones from other tubes, and 
he would not sell me those (understandably).

Back to square one.  What I really needed was the rubber collar insert.  
The bearing itself seemed fine, it would spin nice and smooth.

I tried bying a bent torque tube, thinking I'd get the piece from it, 
but unfortunately it was from a manual trans. car.  That's how I found 
out they were different.  Wouldn't fit.  So, I ended up carefully 
putting two layers of electrical tape inside the collar, and that worked 
just fine (for now anyway).

4)  Getting it back together.  Just beat the stuff back in with the 
sledge and blocks of wood.  Sounds really crude but it works just fine.  
Be very careful not to hit on the metal shield of the bearing - it 
deforms really easily and the bearing will be ruined!

Enough for now, gotta get back to work!
