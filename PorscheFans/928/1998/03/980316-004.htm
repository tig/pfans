>>My '86 auto with 131k + miles shows 3+ bar at idle in Drive with the 
engine
hot. At RPMs above 1000, it shows 5 bar. That's with Redline 10W 40 oil. Do
you see the oil pressure change when the RPM goes above idle speed? I'd 
check
your oil pressure sender or the indicator. <<

It starts between the 2nd and 3rd bar at idle.  After the engine is hot, at 
2000RPM it'll move up to 3/4's of the between the 2nd and 3rd bar.  At idle 
and the engine hot the pressure gauge needle bounces around between 2.5 and 
3.5.  As soon as the RPMs increase the pressure gauge needle settles down 
and resumes its position between the 2nd and 3rd bar.


>>When the car is at idle there is an audible tapping sound from about the
middle of the engine.  Not loud at all.  Could there a relationship with
the sound and the oil pressure gauge reading?  The PO never said anything
about it.   Hmmmm.<<

>>>Sometimes the injectors will cause a light tapping or clicking sound.<<<

That good, I really can not find anything wrong with it.

>>The temperature gauge always sits in the middle.  There is no ticking 
that
would The engine has 96K miles on it and I guess it could be due for a
rebuild.  As as recent owned of the car, I just wonder if the owners manual 
is correct.<<

>>>Temp gauge always in the middle? Does it move at all? Again, it could be 
the
sender or gauge itself, or instrument cluster connector. My temp gauge 
usually
hovers around the white mark that is just below center (about 8 o'clock). 
At
96K your engine should just be broken in and ready to go another 200K.<<<

Oops, what I meant to say was if there was a problem I expected the car to 
run hot.  Sorry about that.

>>BTW, I've only had the car a week and can't believe what a kick it is to
drive it!<<

>>>Congratulations!! <<<

The wife says what the Porsche needs is a blond.   As a blond she uses that 
as her excuse to disappear in it from time to time.  So much for it being 
MY mid-life crisis!

Oh yeah, first time out in the neighborhood in the Porsche, a fellow 
neighbor in a Testa Rossa waved at us.  I don't think that would have 
happened in the daily commuter!

When I was groing up we always referred to our 356, 911, 914-6 as P's. 
 Does the also hold up for the 928?
