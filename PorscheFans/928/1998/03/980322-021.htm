David,

your post says it all.  The combined age of all the 928s you've owned is 63
years.
The combined time you've owned them is approximately 7 years and 8 months.
It would be interesting to know how much all the previous owners spent on
those cars in the 55 1/2 years of their combined existence before you
bought them.  Also are the mileages you listed actual mileage on the cars
or mileage that you've put on them in the short time you've owned them?
Assuming that the mileage is original, you couldn't possibly have driven
them enough in the past three years to incur enough wear and tear on four
of them to expect any appreciable amount of repairs.  Hell! I put more
miles on one 84 than you listed on all your 928s combined, and only spent
seven or eight hundred on it.

To my recollection, no repairs I've ever had on any of my 928s were due to
faulty aftermarket parts, but a whole bunch of them were original Porsche
factory parts such as clutch cylinders, water pumps, a steering rack,
steering shaft bearings, faulty window switches, sunroof switches, a
sunroof motor, AC compressor, rear hatch switches,  master cylinder, etc.
etc. ad nauseum.

Also, I never even hinted that I worshipped Ferraris even though I've owned
and enjoyed several of them.  I don't really understand your asking  if I
own an $80, 000 Volkswagen unless you were calling 911s Volkswagens.
Lastly, your defensiveness over the $4600.00 Porsche bicycles has wounded
me deeply.  Let me know how many of your friends have them and I'll order
each of them new solid platinum Bentley bikes covered with rhinestones.
Lets be friends. I'm through with this discussion.
