As a new owner/member of this elite group I am surprised to see such a
"to do" about radar, excessive speeding, etc. from people who purport to
love cars, and in particular, the porsche mark.

It's always enjoyable to read/hear stories about encounters between
drivers on the streets.  I am an X aviator and have had my share of
hanger flying stories.  The street scenes painted from time to time
here, are similar.  However, my personal opinion is, that it fosters the
wrong impression about the individuals who involve themselves in these
exploits.  I enjoy reading about these experiences as well as the next
guy, however,  is "outwitting another driver", or "demonstrating your
car handling prowess" to an unlucky driver really a example of your
driving skills?  I don't think so.

I joined PCA some six years ago and I am still a member. During that
period of time I enjoyed autocrossing my first porsche, an 87 -944.
(Sold).   I was lucky enough to enter into the world of "PCA" through a
couple of people who offered the very best in understanding the
characteristics of these fine automobiles.  I was led to believe that
responsible adults demonstrate the handling limits of the cars they so
love to the tract, and not the street.  The driving schools offered by
good PCA clubs offer the best bang for the buck and one always comes
away, after attending one of these schools/autocross events, with more
than they went in with.

I would encourage those of you who seem bent on demonstrating your
prowess at the wheel on city/highway streets  to consider taking your
cars to the tract.  After all, YOU KNOW how good your car is, you don't
need to show it.  If you can't resist the temptation to prove it... well
what can I say.  The tract is the only arena where the playing field and
environment are such that you can SAFELY demonstrate your skills, not
only to yourself, but also to other drivers.  Not only will you come
away from attending these sessions with understanding the handling
characteristics of your car at speed, but also how to deal with
emergency situations on the street.  ..You may even save money on not
having to worry about radar detectors..
