When my car had MBS, I tried removing the relay which causes the
blower to run full speed when "Defrost" is selected. Didn't cure
the problem. I'm convinced that it's caused by the overheat
protection in the resistor pack, despite the one hard-to-figure
counterexample.

It's probably wrong to say "When my car had MBS." It hasn't 
occurred for at least a year, but that only means that it's
in remission.
