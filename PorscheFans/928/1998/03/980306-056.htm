Thought this might be of interest to some.  This weekend I was doing
some winter OOS maintenance.  I removed the Timing Belt Tensioner as
part of this.  When I dismantled the Tensioner I found that it had an
approximately 1 inch crack in the steel sleeve that the piston
arrangement rides in.  I'm not sure sure what (if any) impact this had
on the operation of the part since there seems to be minimal side
loading but, it sure wasn't designed to have a crack in it and
considering the function I thought it best to replace it.  The reason I
mention it is this seemed as though it may not be an isolated failure as
the housing I removed was not the unit installed in Stuttgart and the
crack developed right along the welded seam ( I really can't believe
that it was rolled and welded rather than manufactured from seamless
piece, but....).  Don't know if this helps anybody or just causes that
recurring nightmare about timing belts again.  If it's any consolation I
have no idea how long it's been like that (cracked) nor how long it
would have gone prior to doing anything bad (very bad).
