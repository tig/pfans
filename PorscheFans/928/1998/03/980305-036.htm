Yesterday I drove a Guards Red/Black 86S automatic that the original owner
has for sale.  Its' high mileage, 199k, but has always been garaged and
looks in really good shape inside and out.

Drives and sounds like new.  Engine compartment also looks like a car with
much less mileage on it.  He has all maintenance records from day one.
Replaced the transmission, water pump, and timing belt a few thousand miles
ago. Tires okay but probably don't have more than another five or six
thousand miles left on them.  The owner's brother showed me the car and
told me that he had been driving it for the past year here in Florida and
wanted to get rid of it because he has a REAL car of his own that he
prefers.  Showed it to me; its' a Nissan Fillylooburger or something like
that.  He freaked out when I lowered the steering wheel.  Thought I was
breaking the car.  Asking $8000.00.  Anyone interested?
