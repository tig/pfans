Jon,
Antenna is replaced from the outside of car (physically that is). Remove the
rear fender liner in your left rear wheelwell and look inside. The rest
should be obvious.

The actual coax cable screws on to the antenna base up near the top,
sometimes the electrical connections are in the same area, sometimes the
plug is inside. If your electrical connector is inside you should be able to
gently lift the rear corner of the interior panel to see the connector, to
do this loosen the panel screw located behind the corner of the tool cover,
the screw located by the spare cover latch, and sometimes there is a screw
on the panel in the rear corner window area on the top side where it is
hidden. This should give you enough play to get to the connector.
