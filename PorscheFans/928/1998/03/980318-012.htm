Well sharkfans, it has been 6 months since Buxton Motorsports helped me
acquire an '88s4 AT from Texas for $15,000.00  The mileage at the time wa=
s
76,000 and I am now at 81+.  Through the help from this list I have met
Phil Tong And Alan Ng at a Dublin AX. Leonard Laub has given sage advice =
as
well as tickled my sarcastic funnybone through his eloquent wit, and I ha=
ve
found DEVEK and enjoyed multiple conversations with Mark & Susan. ( thank=
s
guys for putting up with me)  List of improvements, waterpump & timing
belt, new factory alarm brain,( old one died and it took a month to track=

down why the car wouldn't start), New tires and rims.  The RE71's are a
little noisy. I think I'll go for the Michelins next as I have heard they=

are quiet and sticky. Per James Morrison's suggestions I had a self
amplified Bazooka tube put in the back with the stock stereo system and I=

get a wonderfully balanced sound with great Bass kick. Replaced the plast=
ic
piece that hides the wiper motor as it was broken and making an awful
racket, and tinted the three rear windows to keep the car from getting to=
o
hot in this lovely CA weather.  Why ramble about these things?  'Cause I'=
m
living a dream and am ecstatic.  There are lurkers that talk about 944 vs=

961 vs 928.  I've had the 944 and the two don't even compare. However,
these machines are definitely only for those people that develop love
affairs with their cars.  People that realize that it is not just plastic=

and metal but that it has soul; unlike most of the Japanese machines whic=
h
although demonstrate efficiency and economy,  just don't excite the sense=
s.
 Oh well, enough preaching to the choir. Time to get back on the road and=

continue living the dream.  BTW does anybody have a digital dash clock fo=
r
my year car and the individual plastic vents for the rear AC?  Please
e-mail me with a price for those items. TIA
