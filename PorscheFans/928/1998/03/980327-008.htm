Painting the floor of your garage is good for many things, including
appearance, cleanability and great looks.  The floor can be painted with
a variety of products and your choice is wide and varied depending on
the expected use.  Home improvement stroes will sell paint made for
concrete floors, be carefule that the paint is made for use on floors in
contact with earth such as most garages.  Moisture below the floor can
cause the paint to peel.  The use of epoxy paint is better becuase the
epoxy will bond extremely well to clean concrete.  As was stated in my
posting about epoxy adhesives recently and as stated in the initial
postings on this subject, epoxy coatings have a weakness with respect to
solvents.   The brake fluid discussed will cause erosion in the epoxy by
disolving the coating.  This is true for solvents which are not very
volite (slow to evaporate).  Epoxy coatings will also "chaulk out" over
time in the presences of sunlight.  Therefore is is best to use a light
color.  In aircraft maintenance facilities I normally use a combination
of epoxy for tthe first coat to bond well to voncrete followed with a
coat of urethane to better resist solvents.

Having said this, epoxy grage floor paint is fine for most of our uses.
Pick a good quality product, which means +/- $50 gal., you will need a
few gallons.  Griot's detailing supplies among others sell a product.  I
would not recommend tile floors for a garage that acually does work,
because tool dropping will crack the tile.  It looks great in showrooms
though and in homes where the cars are all ultimate garage queens.
