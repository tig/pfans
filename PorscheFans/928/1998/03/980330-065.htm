Hi sharkers,

  I spent the weekend looking closely at my new car. The car
has 140K miles, the PO did everything his mechanic told him
to. Documented replacements include:

  New  battery
  3K   since t-belt, water pump, both motor mounts, tires (Falkens)
  15K  since new radiator, steering rack, trans oil/filter change
  30K  all A/C controls and 'program' motor replaced
  40K  since rear U joint, right rear bearing, belly pan

  I'm happy about the important stuff being recent. Problems
I've encoutered so far:

  - Oil leaks everywhere, one mechanic noted
         *  Oil pump (isn't this inside the crankcase??)
         *  Oil pan gasket
         *  Right rear corner of right cylinder head (really?
            wouldn't this mean lost compression?)
         *  Timing belt tensioner (possibly)
  - I found a power steering leak, right at the seal where the
    short shaft enters the rack, that rubber seal that turns
    with the shaft.
  - There is a botched paint repair on the right fender, noticible
    but not ugly.
  - Both tubes going up into the hood for the washers are busted
    (seen this a lot)
  - A 1/4" tear on one of the panels for the hatch
  - Needs hatch shocks
  - Leather has no rips, but there are heavy lines.
  - A/C isn't as cold as I would expect, and it takes too long to
    to get cold.
  - Radio reception is terrible, don't have special Philips tool to
    remove radio from center, do I try and take the whole console out?
    Can I see the antenna power wire somewhere else?
  - Intake manifold paint 1/3 gone.

Overall, I still feel it was a decent buy. ($14K). Most of the big
tickets are done recently. Perhaps A/C will be the immediate costly one,
fixing all the leaks will be a challenge.

Still waiting for my factory manuals to show up. I'm planning
a road trip up the CA coast (I'm in San Diego). Anyone want
to come along or meet? I'll be stopping in Santa Cruz and
Sacramento to see family. Guess I should stop by Devek...
Great time of year for seeing CA.
