Needed a new battery for my 1990 928S4. Purchased one from the local Porsche
dealer. After about 2 months, the battery couldn't turn the engine over after
leaving it sit for two days. Thinking: .."... it must not be the battery,
since it is new...", I took it to my Porsche mechanic (not the dealer). When I
picked the car up, he said the battery had a dead cell and replaced it with a
First Interstate.  I returned the first battery to the dealer. While he was
refunding my money he asked what battery I ended up with. I told him a First
Interstate, and he smiled and said "Good, you're better off since we have
problems with the factory ones".

Whatever it's worth
