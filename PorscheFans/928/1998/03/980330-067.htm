Hmm, you need to determine exactly where it's coming from to
proceed.  One of my accessories has a slight whine when
running, I think maybe a funky rebuilt airpump or worse the
a/c compressor.  The belt tension seems fine.  Kinda' groovy
gear drive sound though, freaks some of the kids out at the
7-11.  heh heh.

I like Bosch platinums for everyday use.  Cheap enough, I
just changed my plugs again.  I figure if I have to take the
old ones out to check on them, for a buck each why not stick
new ones in there!  This last go round the plugs look great,
though slightly tanner/browner than those pictures in all
the Chilton manuals, but no deadly flecks, etc.  Also I
learned that the red powder I saw previously when running
octane boost is chemically caused by >NM?><N?N I can't
remember the chemical name.  Normal condition but made
reading plugs impossible!  The platinums are 'cleanable' so
maybe I'll get one of those spark plug cleaner units for
Dad's Workshop and start recycling all these plugs.  Can't
have enough tools/stuff to play with ;)

I used to run Castrol Syntec also but have since switched to
Mobil 1 Synthetic 15/50 exclusively.  Redline is good also
but not an oil I can just go down the block and purchase
(drats otherwise that'd be it!).  I change oil pretty
frequently too, like when it just starts getting dark.  For
me, I go about 3-4k miles, which could be up to 6 months,
then I HAVE to change the oil & filter, or it bugs me to no
end.  Some of my friends say are you nuts it's too early but
for me I wish I could have fresh oil monthly (used to do the
'84 every 1k miles since it was older)!  But that is getting
out of hand I guess, though it's nice to win the clean
dipstick race (Look at how dirty *your* oil is! neener
neener~)

Another worthwhile fluid to check and change (though slight
more difficult to do so) is your transaxle.  One plug to
drain, one to fill (you have a 5-speed?) just make sure you
can get the fill plug off first!  Devek recommended Swepco
and that's what Marc put in there.  I checked the level last
month since I have a slightly weeping seal but the level is
still fine (phew does it stink though).  Give me time, I
will drain and refill again sooner or later ;)

Why am I going on and on about fluids anyhows?  I guess it
goes back to when I was shark hunting myself.  I used to
freak badly when I pulled the dipstick on alot of those cars
- and saw almost black tar crude dripping!  I vowed NEVER to
let my engine oil get darker than say some blends of honey,
or, really strong tea color.  Too much contaminants!  Or so
I think.  Could be throwing money out the window?  Maybe but
the recycled oil will be much better at least!  (anyone have
opinions on buying that kind of stuff?)

Man, sorry to rant.  Just had chocolate milk (also light
colored) and I guess the sugar kicked in!
