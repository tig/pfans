I'm a member of PCA West Michigan chapter and would like to know where 
the best service shops are for light service on the 928.  Location 
between Kalamazoo and Traverse City.  If anyone can suggest who are the 
best (and worst), I would appreciate it.  Some Porsche purists claim the 
911 is the only "true" model of the marque, yet wasn't it designed from 
the VW bug (the people's car) right after WWII, and did it not use 
primarily VW components?  It would seem that the 928 is more of a "pure 
Porsche" from design to manufacture, since no other company had a real 
major hand in it (other than maybe Daimler Benz who built the trans?).  
I can't wait to bring the 928 out of the garage for the first time since 
November -- maybe this weekend!!  Note: if you like V8s on the water, 
check out our site www.badboats.com.

'85 slate blue/dark blue, auto, Comp TA, new torque tube bearings (no 
more "blower/gear drive" sound)
