Not that I was in any position to buy a new 928 back then, but I think
an electronically controlled user selectable suspension would have been
better than the tire pressure warning system.  

And I think all those reviewers must have been a bunch of wimps, you
know?  Current enthusiast cars are sprung even more stiff than GT spec
and they ride fine for a sports GT.  You want bumpy crashy try my wife's
Miata.  Now that I've thought about it more, Jim's car on full hard
settings wasn't that bad on rough streets.  True, you wouldn't want to
blaze over those metal construction street covers but it is a sporting
suspension afterall.

But that was always the 928's problem in the market - mixed message
sport or luxo.  To me, if it's a 5-speed the answer is pretty clear. 
The auto boxes are allowed to be softer and it's an easy fix should the
owner wish to join the fray.

928's Forever!
Phil
