Subject: Oil Presure

According to my Porsche owners guide the oil pressure should be at the 5 
bar when the motor RPM is 5000.   When I rev the engine that high it does 
not read higher than 2.5.  In fact thats where it always sits.  Is this an 
indication of a problem like oil starvation?<<

My '86 auto with 131k + miles shows 3+ bar at idle in Drive with the engine
hot. At RPMs above 1000, it shows 5 bar. That's with Redline 10W 40 oil. Do
you see the oil pressure change when the RPM goes above idle speed? I'd check
your oil pressure sender or the indicator. 

>>When the car is at idle there is an audible tapping sound from about the 
middle of the engine.  Not loud at all.  Could there a relationship with 
the sound and the oil pressure gauge reading?  The PO never said anything 
about it.   Hmmmm.<<

Sometimes the injectors will cause a light tapping or clicking sound.

>>The temperature gauge always sits in the middle.  There is no ticking that 
would The engine has 96K miles on it and I guess it could be due for a 
rebuild.  As as recent owned of the car, I just wonder if the owners manual 
is correct.<<

Temp gauge always in the middle? Does it move at all? Again, it could be the
sender or gauge itself, or instrument cluster connector. My temp gauge usually
hovers around the white mark that is just below center (about 8 o'clock). At
96K your engine should just be broken in and ready to go another 200K.

>>BTW, I've only had the car a week and can't believe what a kick it is to 
drive it!<<

Congratulations!!
