Phil, Andy, et.al:

Now that we've thoroughly thrashed Porsche for their apparent inability
to decide for whom they were building all these 928s, let me mention the
silver lining. That is, since Porsche gave so many mixed messages for
whom the car was intended, I believe that I (we?) are the direct
beneficiaries. How else to explain the low sales volumes and poor
value-holding history of so fine a car? Now that they've fallen into the
hands of this group of desperadoes, who (hopefully) let PO's suffer the
brunt of their depreciation from $60-70k, and who now find themselves
with one of a relatively few veritable supercars,(with no more coming
down the pike) I'm guessing that at some point the automotive world may
wake up to realities that members of this list already have - many of
the same values that made the car so attractive to me.

So for every time I hear that horrible bottoming out "graunche" (term
coined by Andy McIntyre, or is that an aboriginal term for "my stomach
hurts"), I'm going to toast Porsche for blowing it so badly and giving
us the opportunity to revel in our mutual secret, at relatively
affordable prices. I, for one, would not be surprised if 928's were to
begin to appreciate in value at some point what with most of the
historical criteria being met: exclusivity, rarity, high performance and
aesthetic appeal.
