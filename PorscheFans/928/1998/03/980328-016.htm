I'm not a 928 sandwich anymore.(between Porsches)  I previously owned an
'88 Red/Tan w/AT.  I sold it last year for financial reasons to a lucky
guy up in Portland, OR.  I have been in search of an early model with a
5 spd. this year that I can buy for cash.  I finally found the car and
bought it.  It's an '83 928S Black/Black 5 spd. with 97K.  The interior
is in very good condition and the exterior is very good as well.  It has
been very well maintained and kept very original and even has all of the
tools in the back.  I found it on the net and used various classified
sources.  I went online every morning to check my PorscheFans e-mail and
every evening to see what's new in the classifieds.  Last Sunday, I
found this car available in the San Francisco area, which is
approximately a ten hour drive away.  They were asking $9,950 and after
talking with the owner, I made an offer of $6,000.  We negotiated to
$6,500 and I told him I wanted some pictures or a video to solidify my
decision to purchase this car.  He wasn't able to scan any pictures or
video for me that day but would try on a later date if he could find a
digital camera.  I couldn't wait.  I told him I wanted the car.  I
traveled down on a bus(not a good experience) and met the owner 14 hours
after talking with him over the phone.  I was so nervous waiting for him
at the bus station.  I didn't know exactly what to expect.  It was
gorgeous.  We drove around SF looking at the sights.  We went to the
bank and made the deal and I had a wonderful drive back home to Mt.
Angel, Oregon.  What a rush.  What an adventure.  Now I'm spending my
extra time detailing and reading the fascinating information from you
guys.  Thanks for the information I've received from you all and thanks
for supplying great sights to visit and learn about 928's.

See you on the net,
Mike Stewart
