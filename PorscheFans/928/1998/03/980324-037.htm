  I received Tire Rack's latest catalog yesterday.  They had an article
  on the various track tires that they offer (BFG, Yoko, Hoosier).  
  They were, of course, impartial to specific brands, but the one thing 
  that caught my eye was a reference to properly "curing" track tires.  
  Apparently, a soft compound tire will last significantly longer if
  it is allowed to go through a heat cycle (tire temp of 130degF) and
  then sits undisturbed for a few days.  The catalog said they now offer
  this service via a dyno type of rolling machine for $15/tire.
