Roy:

I just went through this on my 'new' '89S4.   Let's assume that your car has
the same seat hardware, and we can proceed.

The fore-and-aft motor on my car is hanging on a bracket at the front of the
seat frame.  The bracket and motor are covered by a plastic cover that
sticks out like a black tongue from under the seat.  Remove the screws to
get the cover off, and you'll see the motor sitting there.  The motor drives
a pair of cables, rotating them to work some worm gears in the seat rails.
The cables are indexed into the motor's drive,  with the ends of the drive
cables swaged into square cross sections so they will fit in the square
recesses in the drive.  The cover of each cable is held to the drive with
those wire clips.  Take careful note of the installation of the wire clips,
then carefully remove the one that goes to the side of the seat that doesn't
move-- by your description this is the left side cable.  Once the wire clip
is removed,  you'll be able to pull firmly on the cable housing, releasing
it and the cable itself from the drive head.

Now,  at this point I took a pair of small vise-grips and gently clamped
them on to the square end of the cable, and turned it back and forth to free
up the worm drive at the other end.  Mine freed up nicely after just a
little pressure was applied turning the cable.  Once the seat is freed,  you
can start reassembling the stuff you took apart.  With the cable inserted in
the drive, but before you put the wire clip and the plastic cover back on,
confirm that the motor will now move the seat ok.  Then put the rest of the
unit back together and you are on your way.



Some things to consider:

Put a piece of protective carpet in the footwell while you work.  It will
catch stuff you drop, and will protect the rugs from greasy/dirty handprints
and stuff.

When you reassemble the drive,  you will want to turn the cable so that the
seat is as close to lined up evenly as you can get it.  I just turned the
cable gently from one end to the other of its rotation,  then settled on a
mid point before I plugged it back in the motor drive.  This way the seat
rails aren't binding from one side of the seat being farther forward that
the other.

There's a manual drive available for a situation where the motor itself
fails.  I was tempted to use the manual adjusting tool in the toolkit to try
and force the motor and cable.  Fortunately, my curiosity made me pull the
cover off the motor first, where I saw that the manual tool drives the
cables through a wimpy little nylon bevel gear setup.  A gentle pull with
the manual tool conmfirmed that this is NOT a way to unstick a drive cable
or worm gear-- the nylon gear bent a bit with the most gentle pressure, and
will break if you try to pull any harder on it.


Anyway,  this is the procedure that worked for me,  fixing the only thing
the seller's dealer had missed in the pre-sale inspection and repair.
Fortunately mine was on the passenger side, so playing with all the
auto-seat-position stuff didn't burn out any motors.  =8-)  I didn't even
notice there was a problem until I decided to see if I could stuff six feet+
and 180 lbs of dr bob into the back seat.  (not recommended...)



Good luck!
