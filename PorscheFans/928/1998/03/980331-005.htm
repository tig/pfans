JORDAN R RESPONSE TO PHIL TONG 3-31:

Thanks for the information, Phil. I too am good about changing fluids on 
a regular basis. The "gear drive" noise on your car may be your drive 
shaft bearings. Mine had a bad bearing and it sounded like a Pete 
Jackson gear drive or even a blower (supercharger) belt on a 6-71 
roots-type blower. I had the bearings replaced and the sound is gone. 
How do I know when the water pump needs replacement? Previous owner 
claimed it was done around 75K miles. It now has 89K miles. Also, any 
ideas on why the motor gets so hot? The needle on my gauge typically 
runs 8-9 o'clock, and at 10 o'clock when it's above 90 and in idle/slow 
traffic conditions. Even on cold days I feel the radiator and hoses and 
they are very hot. What is the stock thermostat, and is there a cooler 
one available? If so, are there any drawbacks? I've also heard good 
things about water wetter by Red Line (I've had good luck with their 
gear lube in my v-drive gearcase on my dragboat). Any other "easy & 
safe" cooling mods that are typically done to improve the cooling? As 
suggested I'm going to change out my Throttle Position Sensor to 
hopefully take care of my "surging while accelerating hard" problem.  
Thanks Phil.
