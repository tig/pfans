When painting the front bumper cover, is an additive required to make
the
paint pliable? Is there any process (other than a great wax) that can
minimize the chips on this part of the car. I use a bra on longer trips
but
still get a lot of paint chips just driving around town.

I have heard of adding something to the paint for more chip protection. 
I do not know the product but a good body shop can probably help you. 
This was described as a "new" product that added more flexibility by my
body guy.  If you cannot get any info on this, email me and I'll get the
details from him.

As a very interesting side note, I sometimes drive to Colorado from
Kansas and invariably pick up some chips with all the debris on the road
stirred up by semis and those formidable sanding trucks.  I was talking
to my body guy about this and asked about a thin plastic applique that
could be fitted for short periods of time to offer protection for a road
trip, etc.  I was actually thinking about the clear plastic "sheets"
that can be seen in front of the rear wheel openings on some Carreras,
etc.  

He agreed but this would be tricky to do and have it look OK and was
telling me that the body shops now use a "liquid masking" to protect
parts of the car not being painted.  This is sprayed on using an airless
(or even a spray bottle by me when starting back and his equipment is
not available).  Best results were achieved by putting on multiple coats
(like 4 or 5) to the front areas, mirrors, running boards and in front
of the rear wheel openings. With the good sprayers it can be applied
quite "thick" by getting the product to "spider webb" which adds texture
and dimension for more protection.  It still looks fine and offers
protection.  One more interesting note.  This stuff is basically soap. 
It washes off with water.  Driving in the rain?  It comes off after a
while and no messy suds to make it like a rolling washing machine. That
is why I carried a spray bottle for the trip back.  This could be the
beginning of a new product formulated just for road protection but we
haven't gone there yet.  What would be really helpful is something that
could also protect those expensive windshields.  There, the seed has
been planted.

Good luck,  Marc White  81 928   88 928 S4
