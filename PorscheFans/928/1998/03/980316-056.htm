I am now the "proud" owner of an 89 928 S4, 5speed (does this make it a
GT?) and could use some advice from the more learned oweners.

I had it inspected by Braman Motors in West Palm Beach before the
purchase and this is largely a result of their survey.

1. It needs a timimg belt ( 81K miles on the ODO) and I have no proof of
a prior change. The dash gives me a "Tooth Belt service" after sustained
driving above 85 mph. Is the Timimg belt a DYI? The local Porsche dealer
( and Braman) quoted me $600 in labor to install a $40 belt. I'm handy
with cars to the point of changing out motors but am leery of this due
to the chance of blowing up a $3000 engine.

2. It needs new switches for the power mirrors. What's the best source?

3. The option codes indicate a high output A/C. Makes sense as it's a
Fla car. It works weakly at best in the front, and just a little bit
better in the back but Braman says its fully chargeed. I think the
climate control is a bit flooyie. Any ideas?

4. The steering rack leaks into the right boot. I've read the
replacement procedure posted here on the 'Net. Can you REALLY do it on
your back with the car on jack stands? I did one on a Dodge Daytona and
it was a bitch.

5. What's the best way to jack up this car absent a $2000 lift in the
garage?

I'd appreciate any advice you might offer.
