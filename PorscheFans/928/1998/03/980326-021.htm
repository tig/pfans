Thanks for the referral, Dana.  I'm about 80 miles north of Grand 
Rapids, so Kalamazoo will be probably 130 miles from here, but it is 
worth it to me to find someone who is both talented and "caring" about 
the specialness of the 928.  I think the 928 is the best practical 
sports car ever built.  I've always wondered how the '95 GTS would fare 
against the Ferrari 456GT in a road and track test comparison.  The 456 
is almost three times the price, but I would guess that in every aspect 
the 928 is as good.  Maybe give the 928 to Mark Anderson or Devek and 
have them add $50K of goodies, then try the test!  Just a thought, and I 
wish a magazine would draw the comparison, since both are considered 
"world class GT" cars.  Have a great day!
