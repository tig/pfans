I guess I could remove the names to which I have no pictures for but
wanted to leave them up for posterity and hopes someday of completing
the entries...  Also the list for Vol. 1 was getting longish so I opted
to create another one.  I have tons more owner pics to post but not much
time lately due to plenty of birthdays / car projects / blabbing on the
internet :O  Sorry all for procastinating at times but this is a hobby
and there have been plenty of "hey I'm looking at this 928 for sale
and..." messages!

Very heartfelt are the ones from previous owners reminiscing of the good
ole' days.  Re-mulling the production numbers, 928 sales weren't really
high at all.  If there were approx. 15k registered, with a third of
those being sticks (plenty of room for error in these assumptions) that
leaves only 5k manuals, or like 100 per state avg.  Wow.  Almost
irreplaceable, right?

No movie has really done the 928 justice except for the Porsche sales
video ;)
I know you mean the list right?  A FAQ-able item?

Shop wisely and carefully!

And into your 928 - up, up, and away!
