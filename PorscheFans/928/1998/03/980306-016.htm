I answered this a couple of days ago but didn't see it posted yet so I'll 
try again.

An excellent question. Would it produce rich or lean though? You would be 
pumping unburned fuel into the exhaust but also the air that was inhaled 
by that cylinder. I'm pretty sure that some of the fuel would burn in the 
exhaust manifold and presumably use at least some of the oxygen but an 
open plug wire will show up as a lean condition. Of course, if you pull a 
plug wire and see a change in the output from the sensor there's a 
fighting chance that the sensor is working but you will not be able to 
test full lean and full rich output voltages.

There has to be a better way than playing with propane? The automotive 
trainers I deal with advocate its use for several things, vacuum leaks 
are another example. A propane torch is cheap readily available and safe. 
If the local hardware store can sell them to any idiot who wants to strip 
paint...well I think we can assume that anyone smart enough to own a 928 
is several notches higher than average on the evolutionary scale. 
Seriously, it doesn't take a lot of air movement to dissipate any that 
leaks. The fan alone would probably do the job. I'd be more concerned 
about the potential of a back fire or electric shock when pulling the 
plug wire I think.
