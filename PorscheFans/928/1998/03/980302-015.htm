There is a pair of infinity kappa speakers that will fit behind there. They
are very good speakers that will maintain the stock appearence. I was going to
put them in the 83 but changed the look of the interior so I didn't use them.
I have them available new. You also won't have to cut sheet metal behind the
door panel
