"Mad Starter Motor Syndrome"?

As Dave Barry would say, 'I swear this is a true story!'.

At my prior company one of my friends had an 82 928 with manual
tranny. He had an experience one evening, while sitting at the kitchen 
dinner table, of hearing thumping and banging coming from the garage. 
When he opened to door out to the garage his 928 had run up against 
the wall. It seems that the power cable harness running from the battery 
compartment up to the engine had become corroded, and shorted out 
in some way that caused the starter motor to engage. He put the car 
in neutral and quickly disconnected the battery and this stopped the 
starter motor from trying to run his car through his garage wall. 

Several months later, not directly related to the above adventure, this same
gent was in the final steps of trading this 928 for a new 911. He described
standing in the showroom looking at the new 911 waiting to sign the papers
to finalize the deal. He described looking out the showroom windows at his old
928 and back at the new 911 sitting in front of him. Back and forth he looked.
The salesman arrived with the paperwork. My friend apologized to the 
salesman and said he couldn't bring himself to go through with the deal. 
The 911 cost a ton of money and it wasn't a 928. 
Subsequently this 928 got a great new paint job and upholstery.
Cheers,
Jim
