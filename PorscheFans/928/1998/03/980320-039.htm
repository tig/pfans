Hi All!

Ok, I'm stumped.  I am in the process of fixing a cooling system leak,
at the flange where the passenger compartment heater connection
meets the cylinder hear on the right side of the engine near the
firewall.  Due to interferences that prevent me from removing the rear
bolt holding the flange, I have to remove the cold start valve and the
"Y" shaped rigid black tubing manifold that the cold start valve
bolts to.  This manifold connects to the back side of the cylinder
heads on both sides of the engine.

My Problem:  The black "Y" shaped manifold connects (appears
to thread into) to a brass fitting that is (apparently) threaded into
the cylinder heads.  When I attempted to loosen the black 22mm
fitting that mates with the brass fitting, the tubing began to bend,
suggesting that the tubing is welded to the black 22mm fitting.  Can
anyone give me information on the proper procedure for removing
this delightful "Y" shaped manifold?  I really don't want to destroy
the current one, as it looks pricy!

If you have the Parts and Technical Reference Catalog, the manifold
I need to remove is on Page 47, above the part  numbered 31.
This is on an 84 S.

Thanks much!  An e-mail would be appreciated, since I only get
the digest version of this list, and I could REALLY use a reply by
this evening!

Thanks in advance!
