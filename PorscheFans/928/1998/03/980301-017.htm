Hey Andrew (and everyone else contemplating this mod):

You now have first hand knowlegde of what YMMV (your mileage may vary)
means and why this stuff is undocumented and not warrantied by anyone.

Not to fret Ok!  Do not follow the "Did you f_ with it" flowchart. 
Disco the battery, disco the RDK brain, remove all jumpers you may have
added - go back to square one, your stock non-error (other than
repeating text warning) condition car.  Baseline before the any
changes.  

If errors continue 100% stock, you can now follow official procedures
per Porsche.

That done, then try the bypass again.

Good luck!!!
Phil Tong
