Right.  I understand.  And I definitely wouldn't tell anyone on this
list to do anything to their car that might possibly damage their
paint.  I'm just going from my experience.  And you are correct that
Turtle Wax Bug and Tar remover does have petroleum distillates in it,
but take a look at 99% of waxes and polishes out there.  Almost all do! 
(Everyone check your wax products ingredients and write back to let us
know which ones do and don't have petroleum distillates in them.)  Which
is why I use Zymol.  Completely pure and natural.  And it gives the best
protection and shine I've experienced.  (Besides, I'd say you probably
get more oil and petroleum on your paint from driving behind junkers and
other poorly maintained autos that are on the streets - ever seen the
"prism effect" on the roads after a light rain?  Oil.)  If some people
say to use other products then maybe they are right, but my car never
sits outside, so 6 months of protection means nothing to me.  I wax my
cars bi-weekly.  So, to cover my butt ... DO NOT leave Bug & Tar remover
on your cars for any extended length of time, and after doing so be sure
to use paint cleaner and polish to get all residue off.  Other people
may disagree with my methods or products - that's what makes the world
go 'round.  But like I said before, those who have seen my cars can't
disagree that I'm doing something right.
