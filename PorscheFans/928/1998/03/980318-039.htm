	Need help guys,  a competent mechanic here in the Silicon Valley
	(Carrera Tech) just gave up after having the car for over a month.  The
	LH-computer and idle stabilizer were replaced and the problem remains
	the same;

	Have a late S4'89 - automatic,  when the engine is cold the idle stays
	at about 450-500 RPMs? (the second line before 10).  Once it warms up,
	the needle raises to about 700.  The car runs great except for this
	little bug.... BTW,  the computer is a rebuilt ECU from Python Injection
	in southern California.  The ECU was sent back to the rebuilder to be
	rechecked,  but it came back with no errors.

	Got some Bosch Fuel System Management books and I'm trying to see what
	sensor is failing to detect the cold temperature.  

	Need advise!!!,  appreciate your help...

	Did they bother to check the coolant temperature sensor to see if it is within
spec?  Also check for a broken circuit to this temp sensor.  This is NOT the sensor that
is used for the temperature gauge.  If I recollect, the LH system uses the coolant
temperature sensor for initial idle speed.  This is done to give enough time for the O2
sensor to heat up and kick in.  Once the O2 sensor is up, it is then used to fine tune the
idle speed.  There is also a throttle switch that works in conjunction with the throttle
body and the air mass meter.  If any one of these component is out of calibration (or
malfunction..) it will show the symptom that you are experiencing.  I can be mistaken
since I am recalling all this from a distant past....
