I've been hesitant to put the big strap wrench on the grills to get them to
unscrew off the speakers on my '89S4 (Dec '88 production).  I tried hand
pressure to get them off but no luck.  Guess I'll look for screwdriver slots
around the edges to see if mine are "later" or "earlier".

Anybody have a clue when the changeover happened, either by serial number or
by production date?


Also-- David, (and anybody else),  please keep an eye peeled for a luggage
cover.  I'm still looking for one.  I did find the lost plastic fitting
where it mounts, though-- PO had stuck it in the ash tray.  Guess that means
he didn't smoke in the car (a plus!) but that also means it took me four
months to look in there to see what it looked like.


Thanks for the speaker clues!  I have yet to get the foam and fiberglass out
to make the rear speaker housing I discussed in January,  but it will
happen.  One of the local stations in LA has taken to overexpanding the bass
and highs in their music, so the rear 'woofers' tend to pop and rattle even
at casual listening levels.  There has to be a better way, one that doesn't
include any damage to the leather though.
