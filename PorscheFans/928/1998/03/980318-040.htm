Greg:

I read your post and have a few questions for you.  Is there a way to =
lube the release bearing on my GT without removing the tranny and hours =
of effort?  How long would this lube last? (I would like to upgrade my =
car with the new factory parts as described in Angel Paredes' post, but =
have a feeling the cost might be a bit much right now.  The noise i'm =
hearing is faint and i can wait a while to do the fix).
Also, what might i expect to pay for :  1. the updated release bearing =
work &
2. a GTS upgrade like you did.

Regarding the oxygen sensor, what is the reccommended time for =
replacement?  How difficult of a job is it and what did the part cost =
you?
Thanks in advance,
