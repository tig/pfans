Hey Ken:

Thanks for the nice comments.  I am still buried with more updates to
do  but one of these days feeling very inspired (by all the pending
donations? ;) will get them all on finally and take a rest from the net!

Now then, I studied your mods for a bit.  Are the tubes actually painted
white?  I read that Tony Lapine decreed the engine compartment should be
so clean the tubes should be white.  What cars came like that from the
factory & when if you have the info.

I still like the modern, colored hoses on the intake too.  Not stock but
looks trick and definately adds visual dash under the hood.

Ok, don't know if this will make it to the list...  hope it's back!
Phil
