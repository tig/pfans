Phil,
I've had one of those rear muffler bypasses on my S4 for over a year now and
love it!
FYI, the S4 muffler weighs 25lbs and the bypass system weighs 6lbs, that is
19lbs less outside of the "almighty suspension box".

BTW, I just picked up the distributorship for getting the rear bypass
mufflers from the guy who makes them.

There are now three different options:

Aluminized Tubes painted black (like the one you have) $125
Aluminized Tubes painted black with Chrome Tips , $150
Aluminized Tubes left silver with STAINLESS STEEL TIPS , $175
Note: On the stainless the tips are the complete straight area which is over
20" long of solid stainless steel

These options are available for models 86.5 and 87-95

I have also talked to the manufacturer about making these systems for the
16v 928s 78-84 and 32v 85-86.
Should be available soon.

Also available is a complete cat-back S4 system with Flowmasters and the
Rear muffler bypass system. Identical layout and fit as original - Cost is
$500
