On my 85, you could easily change the timing by a few degrees because
the camshaftare not keyed.  This makes it easy to get out of timing and
the only way to correct it
is to remove the valve cover and measure the cam lobe.  In my opinion,
this was poor
design.  There should be an indication on the camshaft as to its optimal
position.

Maybe the camshaft is held in a similar fashion on the 16 V engine.
