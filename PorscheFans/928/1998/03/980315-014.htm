Now, you see, there you go, Gene (O'Rourke).  Inciting dissatisfaction where
there may not have been any.  You are obviously an older guy trying to lead
younger guys astray.

See, there was Warren, complaining about his girlfriend wanting to leave him
because of the time that he spends on the list AND the time that he spends
on his Shark, and you suggest that they should have sex and 150 MPH on the
Salt Flats.

Presumably, you would also recommend that she steer with her feet.

Then there was the thread about flying under the Cape Cod Bridge...you
didn't say Sagamore or Bourne, by the way.  Or are we to believe both?
Actually, many years ago when I was a GCI controller at North Truro AFS, we
used to discuss the relative merits of controlling an F106 under the
bridges, but finally figured that not even our dashing colonel would get us
off....although he told the fighter squadron that if they took the flag off
the flag pole in front of his office, he would put another one up.  They'd
come over low a lot, but not THAT low.

On another subject, I wonder if anyone has had a close encounter with a
Dodge Whatsis....Viper, I guess it is.  Yaknow, the ugly thing with a V10?
There is a flaming red one that a guy drives to the gym sometimes, if there
is NO hint of rain or anything else.   He didn't think it at all funny that
I announced that my Shark had said:  "Yum, yum, we can eat some Dodge
today!"  (I really don't think the fellow bought the car to DRIVE, but just
to show off.....) 

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone with a going Shark had actually met one on
the pavement?  I know they develop a lot of power and presumably torque, but
do the cars in street form, actually translate it to the ground?  And then,
there is the other fact that they really are UGLY looking, but I said that.

I saw the belching Transam commercial, but don't recall it as a 928 that it
ate.     I personally think the commercial lies.  What really happened is
that a Pontiac something got too close to a resting Shark, and the Shark
sucked it up its tailpipe and regurgitated it.  The advertising types that
made the footage, just didn't have a clue about what happened.......

My two cents worth....five inches of snow last night, and thus the Shark
will stay in today, on Sunday, yet!  Bummer!  Or maybe, I should say
Beemer....amounts to the same thing.......
