Gary Tapp,
I did a new garage 3 1/2 years ago about 950sq.ft. The commercial
tile I looked at ran about $1.30sq.ft. plus I had to install them.
I'd seen some of these floors about 4-5 years old and they looked
pretty scratched up.
 After looking around a while I decided on a 2-part epoxy floor,
sorta like paint but thicker. It's been down 3 years and the only
thing that stained it was some ATE super blue brake fluid that
sat on it for about 6 - 8 days. It did not peel up, just left slight
stain. The floor is a brillant white and looks great when kept clean.
  I've got hot & cold water and a floor drain, so wash down is easy,
however if I were doing it over I'd maybe go with a very light grey
color ( very light ) to hide some dirt.
