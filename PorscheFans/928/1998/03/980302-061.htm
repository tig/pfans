I agree with Leonard, both on the Tire Rack and the RE71s.  Note that
the 
suspension settings of your car were created with certain tires in
mind--brands,
yes, but more importantly things like sidewall stiffness.  A car
originally 
designed to run on 50 series tires expects the tire to take up some of
the ride
harshness, and will probably be unbearably harsh on super-low-profile
tires, 
whereas a newer high-perf car DESIGNED for very low profile tires will
be ok.
