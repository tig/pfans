     I'm a FIRST time Porsche and 928 owner. I recently (3 weeks ago)bought
a 1980 928 with 107k miles. Its a 5 speed
manual and overall looks pretty good (repainted @ 2 years ago). Paid $5500
and it is for a fun/project car. Its not cherry, but
everything works on the car and it runs great (very fast) with no apparrent
mixing of fuids and no leaks, but it does has a few problems.
 I did the unspeakable and bought the car without a Porsche mechanic
looking it over (impulse buy). Crazy i know.
But when i saw the car, i was helplessly hooked. You understand.
     The rear axle boots were cut (I pulled them, races showed some wear,
but i just cleaned and
repack and rebooted ,$cheap$,them and put them back for the short term). I
put a new 180 themastat , (the lower bolt head
broke off (panic)and I was very lucky to use a pair of vise grips to break
it free). I DID put antisieze on them. It has had the air
pump removed (god knows what else) and replaced with a pulley and someone
has installed two dials and two switches in the ashtray! The
previous owner said it is some sort of regulator to the fuel pump (scares
me). He said he never touched them.  I haven't
either. The big problem is the 2nd gear. I need to double clutch when it is
cold or be very careful when shifting in and out of 2nd. Seems to
be the only 2nd gear and it may get better after it goes about 20 miles or
so.
Would a synthetic trany oil help at all? Is this the syncros? Suggestions?
The previous owner said he replaced the clutch and
 timing belt 5k ago. I have a friend who has a 944 tensioning tool. Can i
use this to check my belt? Can someone tell me how to
check the tension? I am trying to get familiar with the car as i am reading
my Chiltons manual, but i doesn't tell you everything you know.



Excited, but nervous, new 928 owner.


P.S. This forum is fantastic.
