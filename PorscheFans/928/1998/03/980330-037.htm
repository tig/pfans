As part of the battle against the tail light warning
light, I used an interesting but hard-to-find
product to fight poor electrical contact and
condensation at the same time (recall also list talk
about condensation in the rear lights).  Cleaning
contacts and changing bulbs with general
contact cleaner didn't give lasting relief of
symptoms, but it is just random gremlins again, I
seem to have at least temporary respite provided
by DURON-SPRAY ("eliminates condensation on
cold machinery; eliminates static charges on
fabric, plastic and metal").  My can came from
Hansawerke Luerman, Schuette GmbH. & Co.,
Bremen-Hemelingen.  (for umlaut u I used ue). 
It's made for the textile industry, but we use it at
work to keep water and poor contact problems
out of the electron microscope, so it hit me that
a shot of this would help the 928 lights, and it
did.  The other thing I did was seal the rubber
seal with spray-on plastic that I use on my
distributor.   On a related note, I hope noone sees
a problem with me replacing the 928 10-w tail
lights with 21-w.  The second time around
changing all the bulbs I just used #1057 for
everthing, and the brighter tail lights make me
feel a bit better here in the land of monster
pickup trucks.  I suspect the 10-w choice was
based on some US law anyway, and not in the 
European version (?).
