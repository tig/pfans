Hey Patrick and welcome,

I was through Philly last night on USScare, Nice weather.

Yes the rack can be changed with the car on jack stands (2 or 4). Others on
the list have recommended flushing the system before installing the new
(used/rebuilt) rack and the reservoir/filter at the same time. Two tricky
things are breaking off the old ball joints and decoupling the steering
column. I used bicycle bearing wrenches to separate the ball joints/tie
rods from the rack and left them on the car. The steering column coupler
took some lengthy wiggling as it had been on there a while. Be patient.
Don't bugger up the micro-splines. A good sized breaker bar may be handy as
well as lots of rags. Alignment is mandatory afterwards.

Jack stands go on the lift points in front of and behind each wheel
housing. Use wood between the stand and the sheet metal. I lift the car
using a floor jack centered on the cross member at the rack with a wood
block to distribute the load. In the back I jack the center of the space
frame looking cross member under the MB tranny. Buy good jack stands with
wide bases!

Good Luck


Jay Kempf
