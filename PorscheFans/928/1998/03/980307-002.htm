You could be right on the spare wheel rattling.  Or, it could be some other
part, like the jack, which is stored in the spare wheel well.  Other than
the other mechanical problems someone else suggested it could also be the
battery.  It's in a compartment below the tire and if it's lock-down bracket
is loose it will clunk.

As to the tappet noises, I once had a fairly loud constant clicking noise
which happened on an older 928.  It was corrected by cleaning out the fuel
injectors.  I was told if they get gummed up you'll hear a clicking noise,
potentially getting fairly loud (as it had on my car).
