Howard,

You could spend a few hours of your time and try to "patch" something that
is very critical for the life f you aluminum 928 engine, and have it
possibly (most likely) fail on you in the middle of BFE.

Or, you could fix the problem correctly and replace the broken part with a
new one, with a PCA discount the cost will be under $100 new at your local
Porsche dealership. ($95.72 Part# 928-106-256-03)

This mentality of "quick fixes and patches" is what has gotten most of the
928s out there in the condition they are in, it is a damn shame. Please
don't "glue" these cars together, they deserve much better treatment than
that.

If you were buying a 928 would you want the one that someone has patched
together or the one that the owner replaced a broken part with a new part
like is supposed to be done?

If your local Porsche dealership will not give your a break on your parts,
let me know and I will give you the name and # of the local Porsche Parts
guy here and he will take care of you very well.
