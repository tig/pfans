I know of a 928s with a VAL-1 solidly mounted between the passenger side
REAR sun visor and the roof.  It sees forward and backward from it's high
perch and the remote display in the front ashtray (with kill switch) is fed
by hidden wires.  The owner can hit the kill switch and close the ashtray
cover to eliminate all sight and sound of alleged radar detector.
