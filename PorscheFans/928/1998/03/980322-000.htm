What?  There are people who drive 928s who don't know what a Maraschino
Cherry is?

Lovely, wonderful item of God's Creation Inventory.  A Guards Red Cherry,
best found lurking in the bottom of a Manhattan.  Not NOT Manhattan, A
MANHATTAN.

As memory serves, made with Canadian Whiskey, Angustura bitters and
vermouth.  Drank a lot of 'em in the Air Force.  Used to be a fighter
pilot's drink, until it became unfashionable to drink and fly.  (Correct me
if I am wrong about the mix, Gene...)

Then, again, I may be entirely wrong.  Just Maybe a Maraschino Cherry was
that redhead that I futilely chased one summer.....but that's a post for
another time....

Snowing like hell up here, and I am supposed to take the 928 to Portland for
service tomorrow.  It will be a nasty, nasty dirty trip., assuming I can get
the snow moved enough to get the car out of the garage.  The whole thing
makes me very cranky.  We've had winter since November 1st, and I am TIRED
of it.
