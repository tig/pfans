Hi All,
        I saw Greg's post about the wheels for sale and I have tried to
e-mail him but it my e-mail was returned, so Gregg or anyone out there
with any used rims for sale please e-mail with the details.

I saw a movie on cable called "Red Line" it had Steve Mcqueen's son in
it and it had some cool shoot's of a nice 86 928s in it and I also "just
happened" to be flipping past a prorno channel when one of the guys in
the movie was driving a mint 90 928 but I finished.. I mean went to bed
before it was over so I didn't catch the name.

I also have devised a master plan to create a 928 that will beat any car
in a race (I still have to figure out how to do that and finance it) and
after my car is complete I will get Fired from my Job (If I get fired I
can collect unemployment insurance) and then I will drive around the
country drag racing for money and fighting evil. If your wondering how I
thought of my plan it is simple I just added the shows I watched this
weekend together A-team+Seinfield+Dukes of Hazard = one cool life. (when
you need to get a life you should think of a cool one)
.
