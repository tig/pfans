Hi Tom,
Glad you found it enlightening. I wouldn't worry about an S4.....you're
whooping yours into fine shape!  Besides, you'll be more attached to your car
when the surgery is a success, as I'm sure it will be. (working on these cars
kinda makes you feel like an organ donor......you did run tests to see if you
have "compatible" blood types / knuckle flesh didn't you?......as there is
always some mixing of shark blood and your blood when working on them.....I
believe once a shark has the taste of human blood they become bloodthirsty
rogues and are not opposed to attacking their owners!)

I sympathize with you there bud. We miss our cars when we can't drive them
don't we?

Thanks.....I try....

Yes, I used an OEM (OEM is Bosch) sensor...... bet it helps at least some,
(sure did mine) or at least hope it does...... If it's bad, it's definitely a
good place to start. Seems to be so many things to affect the idle steadyness
of these cars, it's kinda hard to pin it all down.......
