Hi Tom,

Did the Locktite Rep give you an indication of how hard it might be to get
the pan joint apart if you need to get back in? I've used high temp
silicone before and it's pretty strong stuff.

Just curious.

Also, did you do the pan with the engine in or out? I'm looking for a
procedure for doing an in car pan job. There has been some mention of
jacking the motor "a few inches" but no mention of removing anything like
engine mounts or whatever.
