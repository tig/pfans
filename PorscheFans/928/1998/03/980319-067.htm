(LL you might not want to read this!)

Ok, I just couldn't stand it anymore being the quietest shark around. 
Sure doesn't seem like it *inside* the car but when I watched a video of
my car at the AX it was almost invisible because it was so quiet (which
could be a good thing in some instances...)

I ordered one of those muffler bypass setups from 928 International and
it arrived in a couple of days - nice to be just up the state from Mark!
(there is another source available in the midwest I believe, see the
Panorama classifieds)  What was my purchase reasoning? I just wanted a
'fun' mod, the price was right and it's totally reversible.  Ok, ok, Del
has a set and then I heard Elliot's car and figured why not!  What
arrived was a nice stout set of pipes, painted gloss black, with the two
rearmost sections fairly large diameter and ending in slash cuts.  Nice
work, completely stealth.  Welded hangers too.

Yeehaw I thought and installed them in 15 minutes.

Fire the GT up...  Hey, this is not bad!  Still sounds like a 928
through the cats & primary mufflers/resonators.  Not super loud either
but I'd have to follow the car from outside to really tell.  Hit the
freeway and the exhaust note seems to disappear - can hear the tire
noise from the cars in adjacent lanes even - where did the noise go? 
This is a good thing as I was afraid it would drone on the freeway like
some other sport pipes do!  Decel has a nice rumble to it.

Full throttle blasts are much louder than stock of course but not
objectionable at all, at least inside the car!  I'll have to drive more
to get a real good handle on the sound.  Seat of the pants-wise I feel
no changes so only a dyno run will reveal what's up.  Again, this was a
fun mod, not done with the hopes of gaining HP or significantly saving
weight (the new pipes are a bit lighter than the old muffler though).  

Someday tuned headers and the rest?  Maybe but there are smog
restrictions in Cal.  This is a nice intermediate step.  Next thing to
find out later is just how loud the car will be with track bypass pipes,
but I'm going to guess it will be similiar to headers and race mufflers
- LOUD - afterall that's what it will be (stock shorty 'headers'). 
There is always the option to reinstall the factory silencer but I think
the car will still pass track db limits with just the primaries.  Anyone
have experiences to share there?

Well, that's my mod mail!  Ok LL, you can open your eyes again!

ps. I forgot who sent email about sending WAV files.  Please do!  This
is a good idea. We can build a library of exhaust notes!  Believe me,
all these cars do sound different.
