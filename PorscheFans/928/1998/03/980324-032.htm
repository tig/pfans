They appear to be flat (maybe the "spring" is just squashed out of 'em).  
Usually, (it seems to me) spring washers are a bit thinner than "normal" 
flat washers.  Mine are normal thickness as well.  I bought some 6mm 
split locks that I'm going to use between the bolt head and the "flat" 
washer. This will also give me another 1/2 to 1mm of bolt/hole 
clearance.

Will do.  Looks like I might be the "guinea pig" on this one.


There are two spots toward the back of the pan that are little "button" 
like indentations.  These are where the nuts that stick down under the 
engine end up sitting.  I measured 2mm of clearance there without using 
the cork gasket.  My old cork gasket was squashed down to about 2.5 mm, 
so presumably the clearance would be about 4.5 mm USING the gasket.  I'm 
a little worried about having only 2mm there, although, it's NOT a 
moving part (1. Heat will make everything expand, and 2. Not sure how 
accurate my measuring is/can be).
