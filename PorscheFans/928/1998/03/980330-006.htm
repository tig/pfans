Finally took Mr. Shark out of the pole barn for its first spring run and 
what a feeling -- the car always amazes me at its combination of 
capability and civility. Questions: when I first fired it up I heard a 
"screeching" sound, maybe the water pump? I shut it off and then started 
it 15 minutes later, sound was there but less pronounced after it idled 
for 10 minutes. After driving 30 miles it's barely there, could this be 
water pump? Also, since I've had it, when I trounce on the throttle 
hard, it surges as it accelerates (not smooth). I tried a bottle of 
injector cleaner in the tank, still does it. Splitfire plugs are less 
than 5K miles old, same with fuel filter, I run 92 octane. Any 
suggestions? Lastly, does anyone know of any magazines or enthusiast 
report that have compared the last GTS to the Ferrari 456GT? I had 
always heard the mags call the 928 the best GT car, but what about the 
Ferrari (besides costing almost 3 times as much)?  When I was tooling 
around Big Rapids yesterday I caught a carfull of FSU college coeds 
grinning and obviously enamored with the sultry lines of the 928S -- 
SPRING IS HERE!!!
