Porsche Fans,

I posted an email about a 1981 928 that sat for 6 years that was sellin=
g for
about $3,000.  We spent the entire day today (Sunday) tearing apart the=
 fuel
system and replacing every bit of fluid on the car. We changed the oil,=
 and did
a major tune-up on the car and checked all the belts.   After blowing o=
ld gas
out of every filter and pump on the car, we crossed out fingers and fir=
ed up
the car.  I stood by with my kitchen fire extinguisher.  The car starte=
d.  It
was a bit rough at first, but after we reseated a spark plug, the car r=
an
fine.  I guess this is a credit to Dr. Porsche.

The car was actually a one owner car.  It had all service records and t=
he
maintence book in the glove compartment.  I drove the car a bit and it =
feels
strong and handles well.  The brakes are a bit weak, but hey, it did si=
t for
those 6 years, what do you expect.

The only concern is the transmission is a tad rough when doing down shi=
fts.  It
might be the syncros are off.  The more I drove the car, more fluid it =
became.
Again, it could be just sitting for all those years.

The chuch selling the car decided to accept my offer of $2,500.  I thin=
k for
that price, it should be hard to go wrong.
Best regards/Mit freundlichen Gr=FC=DFen,

Fred C. Collins, Ph.D.
