Having switched from the old sealed beam to S4 8" headlights on my '85
shark, I find that while the 8" lights are very bright, they are not very
focused on the road ahead.  I guess this is because the S4 high-beam lights
were designed to work in tandem with the driving lights on '87 and later
cars.

My question:  has anyone installed driving lights on a pre-'87 928?

It seems that the yellow parking lights at the front corners would suffice
to pass inspection and perhaps I could use the larger parking light space
(next to the fog lights) for automatically switched driving lights.  Does
anyone know if the S4 driving lights will fit in that space?  Any
aftermarket lights that would fit?

TIA
