My fault - I considered doing that but was lazy. Sorry about
misleading you.

some conjectures:

- motorcycle brake lines are exposed, auto brake lines are hidden
and hence more likely to suffer from unnoticed damage.

- is it possible that motorcycle brake line pressures are higher
(smaller brake pistons would need that) so that rubber lines
suffer more from expansion?

- Motorcycles have so many accidents that a few extra because of
brake failures aren't even noticed!

OK, I didn't really mean that last one. Though it hasn't escaped
my notice that everyone I know who rides (rode) one has had at
least one life-threatening accident, although that may be more
a matter of vulnerability than accident rate.
