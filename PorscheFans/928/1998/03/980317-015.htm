Phil,

Thanks for the rambling, I love these cars also and I'm picking mine up =
tomorrow, can hardly wait. I just hope it's all I am expecting it to be. =
I've always wanted a 928 since I can't remember and have often watched =
the 928 clips in the films Risky Business and Weird Science.

I love the sound of the 928 so I might just be able to live with a cat =
bypass pipe, if it makes it a bit louder.

I'll let the 928 fans know when I've got the car, and what my =
impressions are.

I'll keep you posted.

Nigel,

Just want to repeat this:  Test pipes, or cat bypass pipes, are simply
plain exhaust pipe - straight through etc.  Sole purpose is to replace
the 'restrictive' catalytic converter.  Some like the new exhaust roar,
others do not.  I wasn't particularly thrilled myself on the '84 - I got
really used to and liked the way the factory exhaust sounded.  (All 928s
sound different too among the various models).=20

I heard Elliot's S4 with the muffler bypass and liked it alot, blipping
the throttle in the parking lot.  Close to a header & sport muffler
equipped car even (read as slightly raspy and loud).  Don't know about
highway droning though and for sure any stealth factor is lost.  No
vendor claims of power effects - it is just a "fun" mod to do and
totally reversible back to stock.  If you try this with a bypass pipe it
will be *too loud* but then again you might like
that?

Finally, the O2 sensor can be hard to spot.  It lives on top of the
cat!  Only way to get to it easily is to drop the exhaust down...

Whups, enough I am starting to ramble!  Love these cars!
Phil Tong

ah cr@p I done burnt my instant noodles!
