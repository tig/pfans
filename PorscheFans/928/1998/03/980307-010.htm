Boy, you'd think with my deep printing and graphics background, I wouldn't
have hoist myself on that particular petard...

The answer is...tah dah! the inimitable David E. Davis, Jr. while he was
editor of Car & Driver. He wrote an article on the 928 of that time, and used
that great line as a sub-title. Unfortunately, I cannot find the article in my
extensive collection, but the line was too memorable to lose.

He also said, and this is a comfort for those of us who opted against that
particular feature, "This car needs a manual transmission like Susan Sarandon
needs a third nostril." Does the man have a way with words? (No offense to you
shifty types; mine is an everyday driver, and 30k miles per year in New Jersey
traffic decided it for me.)
