After an extended drive yesterday, I can vouch all stealth is pretty
much gone and I've resumed familiar cop magnet status, last enjoyed when
I still had all those stickers on the car.  The slight thrumming on
decel coming up to a light makes EVERYONE turn their heads.  The simple
solution is to coast up clutch in or neutral.  So it's stealth on demand
heh heh nice shark!

Zero highway challenges so far, thankfully.  I think everyone has read
that european car magazine by now...

Newbie drivers like me should check out last weeks threads on the
racing list for opinions on tires for competition.  Pretty interesting
stuff!

And all Zone 7 folks don't forget about the AX school coming up...

Ok, back on the road yeehaw sunny sunny day-
