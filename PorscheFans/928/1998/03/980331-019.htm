Hello Tom, I'm next door to you in Grafton.  I don't
participate in DE's myself, but, you can learn about events
through the local PCA.  They have a web site at
http://www.porschepark.org - see the "calendar" for events.
Or, contact Gary Messing at 774-7266 - he's in charge of
membership for Milwaukee region.  There's a montly
publication called "Steinlifters" once you join which shows
more details about events.  The next DE event is May 6 at
Blackhawk Farms.  For what it's worth, there's also a big
charity ball and silent auction at Lake Geneva on April 25
which would be a good place to meet other PCA members.

Enjoy.
