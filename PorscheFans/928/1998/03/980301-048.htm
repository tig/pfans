Howdy folks,

This is my first entry into this forum.  Found you guys thru Phil Tong ,
Thanks Phil!  Anyway, my daily ride is a 82 928 105K (Euro -nonS) Auto, which
I have a love/non-love relationship depending on what its needs are. Love the
driving fixing trouble shooting part. I also have a 87 928 5-spd, to good to
drive except on weekends. My problem is the 87 is alot louder than the 82
starting around 20-30 mph , the noise sounds like I've got Knobby truck tires
on the rear wheels (but they are the Dunlap D40 M2's PO's choice!), swapped
rear tires with the 82 , no change in either car. The tread wear is flat so
far and shows no sign of miss-alignment.  Going to the alignment shop next
week anyway.  Any ideas on the source of the noise or anyone else observe this
difference(manual vs auto)? 

FYI.  Running Redline gear(75w90) oil in the 87 which definitely helped smooth
out the shifting,.Didn't help the noise though.  
 I can tell from the talk I need a short shifter!!

Luv the 4500-6000 rpms area
